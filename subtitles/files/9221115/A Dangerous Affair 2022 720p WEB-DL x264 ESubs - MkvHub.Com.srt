  finally moving the needle

31
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,970
       To burning off
       these love handles.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,970
      You know what I mean?

33
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,560
             - I do.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,730
    - [barbara] ugh, now I
    just need to do something

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,280
        About all these
        lines on my face.

36

   I say, bring me the botox.

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,240
    - I'm happy, you're
    enjoying class, barbara.

38
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,640
  - Mm, he is like a greek god.

39
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,640
       - Do you know him?

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,310
 - Mm-hm, that's pierce dalton.

41
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,070
 He owns handsworth media corp,

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,250
     The largest online
     and print news company

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,900
      In the entire state.

44
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,900
  - I think I've heard of him.

45
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,570
  - Well, I refer to him as the
  trifecta because he is smart,

46
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,990
   Rich and handsome as hell.

47
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,330
      Oh, and rumor has it,

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,260
      He is an absolute
      tiger in the bedroom.

49
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,760
    All I have to say is if
    I were to have an affair,

50
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,750
      Which I never would,
      but if I were,

51
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,930
 Pierce dalton is my kryptonite.

52
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,850
           Ah, pierce.

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,250
             - Barb.

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,770
         (lips smacking)

55
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,360
     - I trust that you got
     the invite to my party.

56
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,440
            - I did.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,450
   - Oh, I didn't get an rsvp.

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,700
      Oh my gosh, you need
      to come to our party.

59
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,940
     It is the perfect
     place to meet everyone.

60
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,600
        - Ah, okay, sure.

61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,030
  - Shoot, this is my daughter.

62
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,370
         I've gotta run.

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,850
     Okay, pierce, what
     can I put you down as?

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,880
   - Um, still thinking on it.

65
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,880
 - Mm-hm, and you, I'm gonna
 email you your invite, pronto.

66
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,630
          - Bye, barb.

67
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,560
        - Pierce dalton.

68
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,990
     That was a great class.

69
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,640
            - Thanks.

70
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,150
 - And nice work on advertising.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,900
    It's the, it's the man on
    the ad that was the hook.

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,330
          - Misleading?

73
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,000
      - I mean, considering
      I was the only guy

74
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,820
      In the class, maybe,

75
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,660
     But it got me in here,
     so guess it worked.

76
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,990
       When did you open?

77
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,990
     - Ah, three weeks ago.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,330
 - Oh, and already a full class.

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,400
       That's impressive.

80
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,660
            - Thanks.

81
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,390
    - So you're new to town?

82
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,900
   - I am, I'm from montreal,

83
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,590
    But my dad is originally
    from new orleans,

84
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,760
    So I feel like no better
    time than the present

85
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,750
  To explore my american roots.

86
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,190
  Florida was calling. (laughs)

87
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,680
     - Well, I never met a
     canadian I didn't like.

88
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,260
      - I'll try and not
      ruin that reputation.

89
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,940
     - Um, I think I'd like
     to get a membership.

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,690
 - I think I can help with that.

91
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,030
    - Cute dog, like his mum.

92
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,950
      Emphasis on the word
       cute, not, not dog.

93
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,850
   - Trust me, I can be a real
   bitch when I need to be.

94
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,210
    (dalton and amy laughing)

95
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,460
      So I'm not set up for
      in-store payment yet,

96
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,960
  But I can send you a link and
  you can fill it out online.

97
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,220
     I just need your email.

98
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:05,970
        - [dalton] okay.

99
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,540
- It's nice to meet you, pierce.

100
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,220
     I'm amelie, by the way.

101
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,540
          Amelie didot.

102
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,450
      - A woman who decides
      to change lives

103
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,320
       Of those around
       her for the better,

104
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,140
 In spite of her own isolation?

105
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,470
    - You've seen the movie.

106
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,650
   - It's an oldie but goodie,

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,570
      And yes, three times.

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,890
     It remains my favorite
      foreign film to date.

109
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,750
       - Oddly, mine too.

110
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,240
         - See you soon.

111
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,420
       - Mm-hm, I hope so.

112
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,000
        (amelie chuckles)

113
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,590
         (glass banging)

114
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,570
          We're closed.

115
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,330
   Okay, all right, all right.

116
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,090
         Um, one second.

117
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,320
         Hi, I'm amelie.

118
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,930
     - Oh, thanks, I'm fran.

119
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,580
     Don't tell me that I
     missed the last class.

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,920
     - Ah, yeah,
     unfortunately, you did.

121
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,600
          - Oh, my god.

122
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,950
  And, and I just saw that tall
  hunk walk out of the class

123
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,500
    And I thought to myself,

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,920
       "that's not a class
       that wanna miss."

125
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,530
 - Last class is always at four.

126
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,760
    - Oh, okay, well, I'll
    make it to the next one,

127
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,510
   Only if you can promise me

128
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,960
    There'll be some more eye
    candy like that in there.

129
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,700
        - Ooh, I can make
        no such promises.

130
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,360
         - [fran] damn.

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,630
       - Is that your car?

132
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,770
          - Ah, she is.

133
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,620
     - [amelie] stick shift?

134
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
        - Mm-hm, always.

135
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,690
  I learned on it and then I...

136
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,140
 - My mom had an old volkswagen
 that I used to drive,

137
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,710
    And wow, that just brings
    back some memories.

138
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,370
       - All good, I hope.

139
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,800
  - Except for the time johnny
  braxton broke up with me

140
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,950
      And spilled orange
      soda all over my car.

141
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,230
      It was the stickiest
      mess I ever had.

142
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,880
I could never fully clean it up.

143
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,870
 - Men are like little
 children with breakups, right?

144
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,210
     It's like they want a
     little bit of attention

145
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,400
   And they just don't know
   how to ask for it. (laughs)

146
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,410
     Sorry, that was weird.

147
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,910
      Pilates, next Monday,
      I'll be there,

148
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,210
 And I won't be late this time.

149
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
       - All right, well,
       I'll see you there.

150
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,330
             - Ciao.
             - Bye.

151
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,660
       (suspenseful music)

152
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,400
 Okay, so I just wanna make sure

153
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,910
  That I'm getting this right.

154
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,680
    So there's an exterior
    camera here and one here.

155
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,420
         And then what?

156
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,750
  I just download the app on my
  phone and activate it later?

157
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,410
    - [associate] yes, ma'am.

158
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,430
       - [amelie] okay,
       thank you so much.

159
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,430
    - [associate] take care.

160
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,260
  - Lived here nearly 10 years,

161
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,870
 Never needed security cameras.

162
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,510
       Safe neighborhood.

163
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,340
      - It was a free
      upgrade with my cable

164
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,940
  And my internet subscription.

165
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,260
 - That's how they get you,
 free for the first six months,

166
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,350
        And god knows how
        much after that.

167
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,450
    I'm margaret, by the way.

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,380
  - Nice to meet you, margaret.

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,700
           I'm amelie.

170
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,600
      - I live alone, but
      I love kids and dogs.

171
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,770
    - I don't have any kids,
    but I do have a dog.

172
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,630
    - And a cute one at that.

173
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,690
I saw you walking him yesterday.

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,870
 Mine died almost two years ago

175
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,040
    And I just never had the
    gusto to get another,

176
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,550
   So if you ever need anyone
   to watch your little fella,

177
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,620
        You let me know.

178
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,800
   I'm home most of the time.

179
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,370
 - I will, thank you, margaret.

180
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,640
  It's really nice to meet you.

181
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,470
        Have a good day.

182
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,390
     - You too, sweetheart.

183
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,900
         (gentle music)

184
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,640
         - [clerk] okay.

185
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,570
        (clerk speaking
        foreign language)

186
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,740
      - [customer] gracias.

187
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,670
           - Good boy.

188
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,970
     Hi.
     - Welcome, how are you?

189
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,830
       - Can I please
       get a new dog tag?

190
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,500
      - Okay, your address?

191
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,500
- Thank you, right, the address.

192
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,010
 The whole point, huh? (laughs)

193
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,850
         (buster barks)

194
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,320
         Okay, all good.

195
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,010
           Thank you.

196
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,100
             Buster?

197
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,180
             Buster!

198
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,270
       I'll be right back.

199
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,100
             Buster!

200
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,110
             Buster!

201
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,610
       (suspenseful music)

202
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,520
    This is my number, okay?

203
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,790
             I will.

204
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,610
           Thank you.

205
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,700
       (suspenseful music)

206
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,200
         (phone thumps)

207
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,850
         (hand knocking)

208
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,050
   - You're missing something?

209
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,880
 - Oh my god, buster, hi, baby!

210
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,130
         Oh my goodness.

211
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,380
          How did you?

212
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,450
         (buster barks)

213
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,140
  (amelie and pierce laughing)

214
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,560
             Right.

215
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,960
               Hi.

216
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,960
    - Yeah, found him
    eating an ice cream cone

217
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,220
 Over in the park on west first.

218
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,150
  Strawberry, I believe, right?

219
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,460
     Yeah, so we stopped and
     got something healthy

220
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,320
'cause I figured he was sneaking
dessert in before dinner.

221
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
          - Thank you.

222
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,400
  Seriously, you made my night.

223
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,060
        I was getting his
        dog tied engraved

224
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,400
   And I guess he was
   exploring the neighborhood.

225
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,070
   - Ah, that would be why he
   wasn't wearing his collar.

226
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,010
  - I'm gonna send you a venmo.

227
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,060
           - A reward?

228
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,740
    - Yeah, a thousand bucks?

229
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,840
- Look, as much as I think that
buster is worth every penny

230
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,420
      And more, I, I can't.

231
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,250
       - Your membership,
       a year, on me.

232
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,240
          - No, no, no.

233
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,570
  I just, I can't accept that.

234
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,340
          - We insist.

235
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,680
  - Something tells me I'm
  not gonna win this argument.

236
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,190
   - No, not likely. (laughs)

237
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,350
     - Okay, how about
     some private sessions?

238
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,510
  Spread-eagling my legs in
  front of a room full of women

239
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,170
 Was, dare I say, intimidating.

240
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,440
 - Okay, all right, you got it.

241
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,030
      As many free privates
      as you can handle.

242
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,860
             - Deal.

243
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,020
- Text message, someone spotted
buster on west and third.

244
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,540
       I guess I should
       take the post down.

245
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,770
     Wow, it's already 6:30.

246
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,190
   - Guessing you skip lunch?

247
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,600
        - And breakfast.

248
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,550
    - Right, well I'm taking
    you for something.

249
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,120
        - No, no, no, you
        have done enough.

250
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,540
      - I'm claiming it as
      part of my reward.

251
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,790
     Plus, you likely don't
     know anywhere to eat

252
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,890
     In this town yet, so...

253
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,210
  - Something tells me I'm
  not gonna win this argument.

254
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,060
        - No, not likely.

255
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,570
        (soothing music)

256
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,740
       Cheese curds, gravy
       and french fries.

257
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,300
       - Don't forget the
       ketchup on top.

258
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,130
      - [pierce] that's
      what you grew up on?

259
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,160
   - Mm-hm, it's my favorite.

260
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
      It's called poutine.

261
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,320
  - Mm, and aside from buster,
  I'm assuming no kids?

262
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,250
            - Mm-hmm.

263
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,080
      - No, never married?

264
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,080
           - Divorced.

265
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,770
        - Oh, geez, yeah.

266
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,330
      See, I can tell by
      the look on your face

267
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,500
 That that one didn't end well.

268
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,770
  - You ask a lot of questions.

269
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,830
       - I'm a journalist.

270
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,930
   It comes to the territory.

271
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,270
 We don't have to talk about it.

272
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
     - No, it's, it's fine.

273
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,960
    He cheated several times,

274
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,120
  So yeah, it did not end well.

275
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,360
        - Oh, thank you.

276
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,960
     - Let me.
     - Oh no, no, my treat.

277
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,310
       (patrons chattering
       indistinctly)

278
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,130
          - Thank you.

279
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,720
       So what about you?

280
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,900
       - Five kids, three
       different moms.

281
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,890
          - Seriously?

282
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,470
     - Sometimes, sometimes,
     seriously, yeah.

283
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,370
But no, definitely not that way.

284
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,370
             - Okay.

285
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,060
    - Never married, no kids.

286
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,470
Had one serious girlfriend once,

287
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,540
       But that ended well
       over a decade ago.

288
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,240
         - [amelie] mm.
         - Mm.

289
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,470
Dated someone briefly last year.

290
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,160
    That ended with the bang.

291
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,550
        - What happened?

292
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,400
       - She was intense,
       very, very intense.

293
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,250
            - How so?

294
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,490
 - Well, the first date was fun.

295
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,060
  The second date was more fun.

296
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,910
       And then the third
       date went south.

297
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,590
       We were at dinner,

298
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,520
  And an old colleague of
  mine was there with his wife

299
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,510
  And they wanted to join us
  for a drink. They came over.

300
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,740
 I thought we had a great time,
 but at the end of the night,

301
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,530
She was adamant that my
friend's wife was hitting on me,

302
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,020
          And I on her.

303
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,680
       - Okay, well, were
       you, or was she?

304
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,200
   - Dolores is 71 years old.

305
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,600
             - Okay.

306
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,870
     - Yeah, with a serious
     bout of chin hairs.

307
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,510
         - [amelie] mm.

308
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,100
 - She feels like any older lady

309
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
    Who's been married for 40
   years does in compliments,

310
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,680
  And I was doing nothing more
  than being amused by her.

311
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,260
    - She sounds like my mom.

312
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,430
     - Yeah, and she's old
     enough to be mine, too.

313
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,380
  (amelie and pierce laughing)

314
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,370
       - So what happened?

315
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,600
  You broke it off after that?

316
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,770
      - Do you really wanna
      hear about this?

317
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,450
  Come on.
  - Only if you wanna tell me.

318
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,880
             - Okay.

319
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,870
     Well, we met because
     we hired her tech firm

320
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,370
       To do some of our
       social media stuff.

321
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,300
          - Mm-hm, and?

322
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,640
    - And she kind of, well,

323
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,730
       How do I put this?

324
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,050
   Started tracking me online.

325
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Yeah, out of the blue, she
would bring up a tweet I've made

326
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,400
  Where I tagged the journalist

327
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,140
     Whose story would
     published through her,

328
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,000
      Retail owner who's
      shop we have profiled

329
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,250
 In the local business section,

330
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,470
     Accusations that I was
     flirting with them,

331
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,320
      Even though I'd never
      met any of them.

332
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
    The final straw came when
    I came back from a run

333
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,900
  To find her standing outside
  my house, waiting for me.

334
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,750
     She looked like she
     hadn't slept in a day,

335
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,250
    And she flew into a rage

336
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,420
       About how I changed
       my running route.

337
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,430
      - She was monitoring
      your jogging routine?

338
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,170
        - I have no idea,
        didn't ask her,

339
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,020
    But to make a long story
    short, I cut it off.

340
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,270
  It had only been three weeks,

341
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,450
     And that was really
     long enough to realize

342
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,020
        That it was just
        never gonna work.

343
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,950
               Hm.

344
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,180
        (phones chiming)

345
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,100
               Hm.

346
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,860
         - That's weird.

347
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,180
   Barbara, reminder to rsvp.

348
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,870
             - Same.

349
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,780
        - It's an "eyes
        wide shut" theme.

350
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,770
   - Yeah, so now you know why
   I was hesitating to rsvp.

351
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,360
        - God, okay, call
        me conservative,

352
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,190
       But going to a wild
       party in a town

353
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,860
        Where I literally
        know two people

354
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,050
       Just sounds too
       adventurous for me.

355
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,290
    - Well, why don't you
    make it more adventurous

356
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,550
    And just come as my date?

357
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,200
          - Your date?

358
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,980
       - Yeah, promise to
       keep my clothes on.

359
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,730
     "eyes wide shut" theme.

360
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,640
            - Right.

361
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,470
       - [pierce] get it?

362
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,390
         - Oh, I get it.

363
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,660
        - [pierce] okay.

364
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,410
    Put your number in there.

365
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,730
   What's your favorite song?

366
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,230
       - My favorite song?

367
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,990
  Something from your top ten.

368
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,640
             - Um...

369
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,830
         - Oh, I got it.

370
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,890
           - Got what?

371
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,230

372
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,920

        - It's your theme
        song in my phone.

374
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,340
     - That's my ring tone?

375
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,580

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,180

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,510
          - Mm, thanks.

379
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,410
   - Giving me a ring tone in
   your phone gives you props.

380
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,170
           - Does it?

381
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,570
        - [amelie] mm-hm.

382
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,940
    - Does that mean I'm
    picking you up at seven?

383
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,930

387
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,620
             - Wow.

388
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,540
            You look-

389
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,780
    - It's too much, I know.

390
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,450
   I just didn't have time to-

391
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,790
      - [pierce] gorgeous.

392
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,380
            - Really?

393
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,130
        - Stunningly so.

394
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,880
          These of you.

395
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,400
 - They're beautiful, thank you.

396
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,060
 - Your chariot awaits, my lady.

397
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,560
         (upbeat music)

398
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,680
    (upbeat music continues)

399
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,610
       - [guest] oh, it's
       a beautiful party,

400
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,010
  And you're a beautiful woman.

401
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,670
            - Drinks?

402
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,780
    - [guest] oh, my, oh, my.

403
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,180
     - Uh, sorry, I thought
     you were someone else.

404
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,360
       - [guest] I can be
       anyone you want.

405
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,610
       - Uh, that's okay.

406
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,870
     Thank you, not tonight.

407
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,610
     - [guest] oh, it must
     have been my gold mask.

408
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,470
        (guests laughing)

409
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,370
    - I love what you did,
    and we will, absolutely.

410
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,780
  - [woman] thank you, pierce.

411
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,800
     - [amelie] here you go.

412
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,650
       - [pierce] thanks.

413
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,730
        Everything okay?

414
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,480
      - Everything's fine.

415
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,390
   Just saw man that I thought
   was you from behind.

416
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,890
    - Hm, did he hit on you?

417
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,650
       - He did, actually.

418
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,650
          - Va-va-voom!

419
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,220
        Look at you two.

420
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,560
           - Barbara?

421
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,650
       - The one and only.

422
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,560
         - [amelie] wow.

423
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,880
           - Hey, bud.

424
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,720
      - Frank, thanks so
      much for the invite.

425
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,810
   - Are my eyes playing faint

426
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,410
      Or did you and pierce
      arrive together?

427
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,650
            - We did.

428
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,650
  - Oof, you lucky, lucky girl.

429
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,750
- Okay, chocolate mint martinis,

430
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,920
     How did they warm their
     way into the theme?

431
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,080
    - Well, dark chocolate is
    an aphrodisiac, my dear.

432
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,760
    How do you not know that?

433
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,260
     - Barbara, I can't
     believe you live here.

434
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,350
     This place is massive.

435
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,770
  - It's way too large for us,
  but barbara refuses to move.

436
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,840
      - Mm, what can I say?

437
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,610
        I like them big.

438
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,370
             - Okay.

439
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,590
       Do you mind if I
       give her the tour?

440
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,950
        - Of course, feel
        free to wander.

441
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,940
       - [pierce] cheers.

442
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,200
- That's the theme of the party.

443
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,710
      - This place is, it's
      like an art gallery.

444
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,940
     - [pierce] appropriate,
     wouldn't you say,

445
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,630
   For the great granddaughter
   of harold gershwin?

446
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,390
      - The minimalist
      artist of the 1920s?

447
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,700
   - [pierce] that's the one.

448
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,810
        - Oh, wow, okay,

449
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,060
         So these are...

450
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,120
        - Very expensive.

451
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,890
         - [amelie] hmm.

452
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,990
     - Beautiful, isn't it?

453
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,070
     - [amelie] yeah, it is.

454
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,150
     - What do you think has
    transpired between them?

455
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,910
 - Oh, art is about perception.

456
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,240
     It's in the eye of the
     beholder, isn't it?

457
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,990
            - It is.

458
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,080
 So what would yours be of this?

459
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,170
      - An argument, maybe?

460
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,930
He's asked for forgiveness, and,

461
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,260
   And, she's given in, again.

462
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,020
          What's yours?

463
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,520
    What is your perception?

464
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,290
   - Well, he's, he's worried.

465
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,780
        She's exhausted.

466
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,930
       Maybe he saved her.

467
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,870
       (melancholy music)

468
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,370
   He really hurt you, didn't
   he, your ex-husband?

469
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,130
            - He did.

470
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,720
    Cheating, you know, it
    just feels like betrayal.

471
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,800
       Over and over
       again, he would cry

472
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,150
       And pledge he would
       never do it again,

473
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,150
    And I would forgive him,

474
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,570
       Losing a little bit
      of myself each time,

475
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,330
 My, my self esteem diminishing

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,590
    Until I didn't even
    recognize myself anymore.

477
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,340
         I became numb.

478
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,190
       No more desire, no
       more lust for him.

479
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,360
         I, I just was.

480
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,540
      The worst part was
      that I became someone

481
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,530
      Who couldn't even...

482
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,200
        - Trust anymore?

483
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,210
           - Exactly.

484
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,960
       (melancholy music)

485
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,560
       - You're beautiful,
       amelie didot,

486
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,470
         Inside and out.

487
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,060
         (lips smacking)

488
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,230
  Should we continue the tour?

489
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,070
            - Let's.

490
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,490
  Is the lady's room that way?

491
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,240
          - Yes, it is.

492
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,640
       Why don't I grab us
      a plate of appetizer

493
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,650
    And meet outside in five?

494
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,330
           - Perfect.

495
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,590
         (gentle music)

496
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,500
     (amelie exhales deeply)

497
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,350
(guests chattering indistinctly)

498
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,440
          - Oh, sorry.

499
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,780
         (ominous music)

500
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,380
            - Pierce?

501
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,700
             Pierce?

502
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,620
   Oh my god, someone help me!

503
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,380
          Someone help!

504
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,070
        (dramatic music)

505
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,400
            - Amelie?

506
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,320
            - Pierce?

507
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,980
        (barbara crying)

508
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,330
       (suspenseful music)

509
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,220
   - If you remember anything
   else, here's my card.

510
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,950
          - Thank you.

511
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,680
    (indistinct radio voice)

512
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,080
       - [guest] I can be
       anyone you want.

513
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,340
      - Let's get you home.

514
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,480
       (suspenseful music)

515
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,180
    - Reach those arms up
    to the sky on an inhale,

516
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,010
      Straight as a board.

517
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,520
  Exhale, bring them down to
  your side and curl the spine,

518
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,940
  Drawing the navel in as tight
  as you can to the spine.

519
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,520
  And if that's too hard fran,

520
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,610
  You can just bring them right
  back down into tabletop.

521
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,370
            Nice job.

522
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,860
            Good job.

523
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,180
       Hold that position.

524
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,870
        Belly drawing in
        toward the spine.

525
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,550
       - I need to talk
       to you after class.

526
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,500
       - Sure, sure thing.

527
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,770
   All right, good job, nice.

528
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,440
    Keep those arms straight.

529
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,890
      Just 30, more seconds
      in this position.

530
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,880
       (suspenseful music)

531
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,720
  Bye, ladies, good job today.

532
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,570
       - Wow, great class.

533
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,880
      - You know, I have a
      three-for-five promo

534
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,390
       Going on right now.

535
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,620
        Maybe you wanna
        sign up for that?

536
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,630
      - I actually saw that
      in the newspaper.

537
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,490
   - It's good to know all my
   advertising is paying off.

538
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,360
           - Sure is.

539
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,320
       - Are you doing
       some construction?

540
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,150
  - Oh no, that's just, that's
  the little side thing.

541
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,590
 I got a project that I'm doing.

542
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,480
 - You know, it looks like
 your pen exploded in your bag.

543
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,490
          - Oh, shoot!

544
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,230
            Damn it.

545
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,140
  - I destroyed my favorite
  satchel with an exploded pen.

546
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,830
         It's the worst.

547
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,810
      I never carry pens in
      my purse after that.

548
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,590
            Hey barb.

549
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,260
      - I, I've gotta run.

550
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,150
 I got a call from my daughter,
 but I will call you later.

551
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,590
   - Okay, is everything okay?

552
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,430
          - It's fine.

553
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,820
          - Bye, barb.

554
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,600
            - Uh-huh.

555
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
       - Well, if you
       find a plan online,

556
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,010
        Just feel free to
        sign up for it.

557
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,900
             - Sure.

558
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,760
      - Uh, I hate to rush
      you out the door,

559
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,610
    I just, I have a private
    session starting soon.

560
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,510
      - Oh, you teach
      private lessons now?

561
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,040
      - Yeah, it's just the
      one client right now,

562
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,030
    And it's, it's kind of a
     pro bono type of thing.

563
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,030
            - Really?

564
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,530
     - Yeah, my dog ran off,

565
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,950
 And, and he actually found him.

566
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,360
     This is what he
     wanted for the reward.

567
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,460
      - It's not the hunk I
     saw leaving your class

568
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,620
 When I missed it the other day?

569
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,800
       - It is, actually.

570
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,470
         (picture bangs)

571
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,150
       - I'll think about
       that membership.

572
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,320
         (ominous music)

573
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,620
      - Thanks for coming?

574
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,900
         (ominous music)

575
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,820
         Mm, seriously?

576
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,780
         (ominous music)

577
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,410
         (hand knocking)

578
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,170
        - You all right?

579
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,070
      - Yeah, yeah, I
      just got this client

580
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,990
 Break my picture frame though.

581
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,830
       - What do you mean?

582
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,850
     - She slammed it down,
     breaking the glass.

583
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,240
         - That's weird.

584
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,350
     - Yeah, just added to
     all the other weirdness

585
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,510
      Happening as of late.

586
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,700
         - [pierce] hmm.

587
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,980
       - Guess I shouldn't
       be surprised.

588
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,920
  Speaking of which, any leads?

589
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,270
        - No, not really.

590
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,770
    Police are still keeping
    the case pretty quiet.

591
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,020
 I'm waiting on more information

592
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,770
      Before I publish
      anything in my paper.

593
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,930
We're working on a pass for now.

594
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,430
     - Have you ever covered
     a murder before?

595
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,870
       - Yes, but not one
       in my own backyard.

596
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,130
 It's all a little bit bizarre,

597
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,950
Where it was and, you know, you.

598
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,860
              - Me?

599
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,670
              Ah.
              - Oh.

600
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,110
        - You know what?

601
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,380
        I have band-aids.

602
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,400
   - Yeah, you know, just how
   you found him and all that.

603
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,390
    - It's like a bad dream.

604
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
 Not too mention, barb wouldn't
 even look at me today.

605
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,080
    Maybe she feels weird
    seeing me because of it.

606
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,480
       - No, I doubt that.

607
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,890
    I'm sure she just feels
    the same as you about it.

608
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,650
       After all, it did
       happen in her home.

609
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,910
             - Yeah.

610
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,240
      - I also learned
      that the man, brian,

611
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,380
       Was a university
       friend of frank's,

612
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,080
 Probably was quite a good one.

613
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,320
          So, you know,

614
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,980
  I think everyone's just
  feeling little out of sorts.

615
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,480
 - Yeah, you're probably right.

616
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,760
         - There we are.

617
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,080
          Good as new.

618
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,500
        - Thanks, doctor.

619
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,590
        - Take my advice,
        I know it's hard,

620
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,850
  Just try and forget about it.

621
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,100
     - I'm trying, trust me.

622
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,180
     You wanna get started?

623
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,940
         - Let's do it.

624
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,280
         (smooth music)

625
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,780
          (door bangs)

626
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,110
           - Perfect.

627
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,450
         (smooth music)

628
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,210
  - I just wanna make sure your
  core is doing all the work.

629
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,120
    You shouldn't be feeling
    anything in your back.

630
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,280
       Old pro, it seems.

631
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,210
              - No.

632
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,300
          - That's it.

633
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,130
           All right.

634
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,790
      - Okay, how do I
      dismount this thing?

635
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,550
       - I believe in you.

636
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,430
          - Gratefully.

637
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,490
- Okay, lay down onto your back.

638
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,150
        We're gonna do my
       favorite, bridges.

639
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,720
  Okay, feet pushing the floor,
  arms down by your side.

640
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,650
     We're gonna inhale, and
    one vertebrae at a time,

641
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,900
    We're gonna roll up
    through our spine, okay?

642
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:09,660
             Inhale.

643
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,070
         (smooth music)

644
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,500
    (amelie breathing deeply)

645
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,000
     Mm-hm, and we're just
     gonna pulse at the top.

646
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,670
      - [pierce] like this?

647
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,520
     - Yeah, just like that.

648
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,250
      - I feel ridiculous.

649
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,670
        (amelie laughing)

650
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,520
              Okay.

651
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,840
    There you go, you got it.

652
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
       - No, I like this.

653
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,180
   - (laughs) you do, do you?

654
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,530
       Okay, it's close,
       but can I show you?

655
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,530
          - Sure, yeah.

656
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,040
        (seductive music)

657
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,610
     - See how I'm squeezing
     my butt muscles?

658
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,300
   You wanna make sure you're
   not feeling anything

659
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,060
          In your back.

660
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,310
              See?

661
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,560
        - Oh, yes I, uh,

662
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,560
       Yeah, no, that's,
       um, that's helpful.

663
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,730
        (seductive music)

664
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,520
         (amelie moans)

665
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,770
     - And to work both the
     buttocks, you hold.

666
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,610
        - [delivery man]
        hello, delivery.

667
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,340
     - [amelie] sorry, I
     thought I closed that.

668
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,460
   - Nothing to apologize for.

669
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,790
       - [amelie] this is
       so unprofessional.

670
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,460
       I feel ridiculous.

671
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,630
          - Ridiculous?

672
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,640
     Ridiculous like I can't
     get you off my mind?

673
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,560
          - You can't?

674
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,320
              - No.

675
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,980
       - Dinner at my
       place Friday night?

676
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,780
          - All right.

677
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,660
  - Looks like our hour is up.

678
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,830
        - I think it is.

679
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,830
   - Thanks for a great class.

680
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,680
       (melancholy music)

681
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,510
       You have an amazing
       rest of your day.

682
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,350
       - I will, you too.

683
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,570
       (melancholy music)

684
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,860
          (door bangs)

685
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,290
     (car engines whirring)

686
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,870
       (suspenseful music)

687
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,950
  - Hey, did you see the
  draft of the mansion murder?

688
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
  - Mansion murder, seriously?

689
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,600
        - An "eyes wide
        shut" theme party

690
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,270
   Where a local
   entrepreneur was murdered.

691
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,840
     - Yes, I get the angle,

692
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,770
   But not for this one, okay?

693
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,730
             - Okay.

694
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,370
   Brian left behind two kids

695
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,220
   And a lot of grieving
   family members and friends,

696
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,550
 Many of whom I know personally,

697
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,230
 So we're not gonna
 sensationalize this one, okay?

698
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,880
 Let's just publish information
 confirmed by the police.

699
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,650
    - Which I did, but I
    will change the headline.

700
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,310
     In the meantime, can
     you take a look at it?

701
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,970
       It's in the online
       drafts folder.

702
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,880
             - Yep.

703
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,740
       Yeah, looking now.

704
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,580
             Thanks.

705
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,750
       (suspenseful music)

706
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,500
              Dale!

707
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,820
         - [dale] what?

708
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,990
    - What the hell is this?

709
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,340
       - What do you mean?

710
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,640
      - "sources close to
      the investigation say

711
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,000
      That amelie didot is
      thought to have been

712
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,310
   In a romantic relationship
   with the deceased.

713
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,830
  Didot, a canadian transplant

714
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,010
Is currently under investigation
for running a sex ring."

715
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,350
    - Where does it say that?

716
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,000
- "out of her newly-established
pilates studio."

717
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,320
  - I didn't write that, boss.

718
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,580
      - What do you mean
      you didn't write it?

719
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,820
       - I mean that I
       didn't write that.

720
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,750
        I've never seen
        that photo before

721
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,740
        And I don't even
        know who she is.

722
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,500
      I think our system's
      been hacked, pierce.

723
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,950
       - Open your account
       now and erase it.

724
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,850
    We need it off the system
    and change the passcodes.

725
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,680
      - I don't know how to
      change the passcode.

726
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,280
   - Well, call brody in tech.

727
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,740
           Do it now!

728
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,600
  - I mean, are you doing okay?

729
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,360
          - Yes and no.

730
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,030
     I guess I just, I can't
     believe it happened.

731
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,880
      It seemed so unreal.

732
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,790
        - I can imagine.

733
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,300
     - Hey, I, I don't wanna
     make you feel uneasy,

734
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,190
     But you know that woman
    that you were talking to

735
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,190
   After class the other day?

736
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,540
     - Ooh, the oddball who
     broke my picture frame

737
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,290
 And got ink all over my floor.

738
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,140
 - She broke your picture frame?

739
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,140
     - Yeah, she slammed it
     down and smashed it.

740
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,800
        It was so weird.

741
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,370
 Maybe she was having a bad day.

742
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,140
     - Okay, you cannot let
     her back in your studio

743
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,310
      Or anywhere near
      you for that matter.

744
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,300
             - Why?

745
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,890
 - Amelie, that was pierce's ex.

746
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,730
       Does pierce know
       that she was there?

747
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,400
    - No, she left the studio
    before and he came.

748
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,220
             - Good.

749
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,810
       I am gonna give
       you the same advice

750
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,650
 That pierce is gonna give you,

751
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,670
       You need to keep
       her away from you.

752
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,730
     - How do you know her?

753
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,500
       - I don't, I only
       met her in passing.

754
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,910
       She and pierce
       were at the movies.

755
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,340
      I guess they were on
      their second date.

756
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,660
    The following day, I get
     a text message from her

757
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,160
Asking if she wanted to meet up.

758
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,180
  - Like, like out of the blue?

759
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,020
    - Yeah, so I assumed that
    pierce gave her my number

760
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,240
     And I felt obligated to
     get together with her.

761
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,410
  Anyway, we meet for lunch and
 she seemed fantastic at first.

762
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,100
      You know, she started
      even telling me

763
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,360
     How sexually compatible
     she and pierce were.

764
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,870
   I did find it (indistinct).

765
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,610
          - Of course.

766
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,780
  - And then she starts to dig,
  like dig up stuff on pierce.

767
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,040
 She even went as far as to ask
 if he and I had ever dated.

768
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,330
         (upbeat music)

769
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,880
      She said, "I couldn't
      help but notice

770
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,530
  How you kissed him on the
  cheek the first time we met."

771
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,120
   Uh-huh, and get this, next
   time I run into pierce,

772
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,280
      He told me he had
      to break up with her

773
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,130
    Because she was becoming
    excessively jealous

774
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,950
      To the point of being
      obsessed with him.

775
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,380
       He also shared with
       me he had no idea

776
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,720
 That we got together for lunch

777
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,240
 Or how she even got my number.

778
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,730
       I, I tell you what,
       this is just crazy.

779
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,480
 I, I saw her there that night.

780
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,910
       I swear, I saw her.

781
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,070
   By the time I got down to
   see her, see if it was her,

782
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,430
 She'd taken off into the crowd.

783
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,750
   You know, I, I wasn't
   worried about it at first,

784
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,340
      But if that was her,
      she noticed you.

785
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,670
          - Noticed me?

786
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,080
     - Why do you think she
     came to your studio?

787
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,600
       Listen, you have
       got to be careful.

788
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,420
      Ever since my party,

789
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,100
        I am thinking the
       worst of everyone.

790
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,680
       (suspenseful music)

791
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,950
  Yeah, let's get out of here.

792
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,100
      (car engine whirring)

793
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,280
 (barbara speaking indistinctly)

794
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,690
      - [amelie] yes, yes,

795
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,690
      I'll see you tonight.

796
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,950
   I'll see you at the studio.

797
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,300
        - [barbara] yeah,
        see you in class.

798
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,250
         (upbeat music)

799
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,480
        - [fran] hey you.

800
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,200
       - Hey, what are you
       doing over here?

801
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,890
    - I was just driving
    by, but you need a lift?

802
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,330
     - Uh, no, no, nothing,

803
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,890
     Um, but I'm, I'm good.

804
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,740
           Thank you.

805
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,500
             - Okay.

806
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,310
   - Do you live around here?

807
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,400
   - No, but my favorite pizza
   joint does so, you know.

808
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,220
             - Right

809
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,410
  - Why don't you get in? I'll
  totally give you a ride.

810
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,740
    - I'm, I'm good, thanks.

811
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,340
     Actually, that's my car
     share, but thank you.

812
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,180
    - I'm literally offering
     to save you some money,

813
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,090
        Give you a ride.

814
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,840
      It's not a big deal.

815
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,180
   - Thanks, thanks, I'm good.

816
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,980
          Another time.

817
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:01,810
           - Whatever.

818
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,870
      (car engine whirring)

819
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,770
       (tires screeching)

820
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,700
       (suspenseful music)

821
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,290
         (buzzer chimes)

822
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,720
     - Hi, it's amelie, uh.

823
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,890
         (door creaking)

824
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,400
  - Welcome to my humble abode.

825
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:53,210
      - By humble abode you
      mean lavish mansion?

826
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,370
        - Tomato, tomato.

827
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,590
  Certainly keeps the rain off.

828
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,490
           You hungry?

829
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,820
      - [amelie] starving.

830
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,590
       - That's good, kind
       of went all out.

831
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,920
      - [amelie] thank you.

832
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,060
      - My mother's recipe.

833
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,110
           - Mm, yum.

834
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,010
     - So have a confession.

835
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,430
 I miss-gauged the cooking time

836
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,750
      So we have about half
      an hour til dinner.

837
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,020
 - Okay, well, how about a tour?

838
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,780
  - Mm, but of course, madame.

839
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,750
         Right this way

840
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,910
        (uplifting music)

841
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,470
       (slow funky music)

842
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,300
      Last, but not least.

843
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,790
 - You've got to be kidding me.

844
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,550
       - You don't have
       pools in montreal?

845
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:10,220
   - They do, which is usually
   a hole in the ground.

846
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,230
        (pierce chuckles)

847
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,650
- How was your dinner with barb?

848
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,990
         - It was nice.

849
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,990
     Yeah, you were right,
     she's just been rattled

850
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,120
      By the whole murder,
      rightfully so.

851
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,840
  She did tell me something
  that she felt I should know.

852
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,080
         - What's that?

853
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,990
        - She cautioned
        me about your ex.

854
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,400
            - My ex?

855
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,140
             - Fran.

856
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,420
     You remember me telling
     you about that woman

857
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,250
  That came into my studio and
  smashed my picture of buster?

858
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,490
  - She's been to your studio?

859
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,820
     - Had a one-time class.

860
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
 - Okay, there's something I
 didn't share with you earlier.

861
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,030
   I had to take a restraining
   order out on her.

862
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,610
     It's a first, trust me.

863
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,710
    That's alarming that
    she came to your studio.

864
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,880
       It's just too much
        of a coincidence.

865
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,890
   - You know, everyone takes
   breakups differently.

866
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,610
    This is embarrassing, but
    I even googled the woman

867
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,470
       That my ex-husband
       is now seeing.

868
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,460
I looked her up on social media.

869
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,970
It's kind of normal to quasi
stock your ex's new girlfriend.

870
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,790
      - This is different.

871
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,810
    - All I'm saying is that
     maybe she's just having

872
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,860
     A hard time letting go.

873
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,990
   Just might take some time.

874
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,030
     - I hope you're right.

875
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,410
   - Let's change the subject.

876
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,320
       - Yes, please, but
       you must tell me

877
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,410
   If she comes back in there.

878
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,210
           - Promise.

879
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,750
         You swim often?

880
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,930
          - Every day.

881
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,260
          - Every day?

882
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,260
       - Every day, every
       day but today.

883
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,260
       - Oh, you're just,

884
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,100
       You're gonna get
       in right now, okay.

885
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,730
    - No time on the present.

886
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,110
       (slow funky music)

887
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,570

888
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,530
         Are you coming?

889
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,260
      - How can I resist on
      an evening like this?

890
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,310

915
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,810
   I've never seen anyone jump

      It's my favorite bit.

919
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,480
   Seriously, I put a podcast
   of piketon massacre

920
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,820
         And away I go.

921
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,150
- Piketon massacre, what's that?

922
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,580
- It's only the best true-crime
podcast there is right now.

923
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,590
       - Oh, really, okay.

924
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,970
   Looks like your fire
   alarm triggered something.

925
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,580
   - [pierce] that's a first.

926
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,310
        - Burning a meal?

927
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,090
   - Yeah, that too, but never
   triggered my fire alarm.

928
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,010
  - I just had a security
  system put in my place, too.

929
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,490
        - [pierce] yeah?

930
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,170
   - Mm-hm, it was a freebie,

931
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,000
  But I now feel like I'm
  living the life of the elite.

932
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,930
    - So that makes me elite?

933
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,610
    - Have you seen my purse?

934
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,610
       - Maybe over there?

935
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,700
         - [amelie] mm.

936
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,600
           Oh my god.

937
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,200
     - [pierce] what's that?

938
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:19,370
   - Well, it looks like a, a
    pen exploded in my purse.

939
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,200
        That's so weird.

940
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,450
     - It's weird that a pen
     exploded in your purse?

941
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,790
      - No, it's just that,

942
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,550
Oh shoot, that is my ride share.

943
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,140
     - You know I could
     have given you a ride.

944
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:35,980
    - I know, but that might
    have led to something

945
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,640
      That we're not quite
       ready for just yet.

946
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,480
   - Mm-hm, true, but at the
   expense of sounding cliche,

947
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,230
   That was sincerely the best
   evening I've had in years,

948
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,330
          So thank you.

949
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,910
        - It really was.

950
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,390
       And thank you for
       these warm clothes.

951
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,750
  I will return them promptly.

952
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,650
        (water burbling)

953
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,260
         (lips smacking)

954
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,420
  - Don't forget my flip flops.

955
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,260
          - Those too.

956
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,280
        (water burbling)

957
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,360
       (suspenseful music)

958
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,190
      (car engine whirring)

959
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,350
   Thanks, have a good night.

960
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:35,440
        (door bangs shut)

961
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,550
       (suspenseful music)

962
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,220
             Buster?

963
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,230
         Bus! (whistles)

964
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,720
  Buster, where are you, buddy?

965
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,630
       (suspenseful music)

966
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,470
             Buster?

967
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,560
       Hi, there you are.

968
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,140
               Hi.

969
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:07,990
            Hi baby.

970
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,900
       Why are you sticky?

971
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,050
       Did you get into
       something, b, hmm?

972
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,000
      You want some dinner?

973
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:16,990
        (buster barking)

974
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,910
          (door bangs)

975
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,830
       It's just the wind,
      baby, just the wind.

976
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,590
      (paper bag rustling)

977
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,670
       (suspenseful music)

978
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,500
          There you go.

979
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,850
       (suspenseful music)

980
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,750
       Poured orange soda
       all over my car.

981
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,440
      It was the stickiest
      mess I ever had.

982
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,790
         (ominous music)

983
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,300
  - 911, what's your emergency?

984
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,030
      - Sorry, I didn't, I
      didn't mean to call.

985
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,140
       (suspenseful music)

986
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,960
 Come on buddy, let's go to bed.

987
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,150
        (water burbling)

988
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,730
         (phone ringing)

989
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,060
      - [security]
      security assistance.

990
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,650
       - Yes, hello, this
       is pierce dalton

991
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,650
     Over on eighth avenue.

992
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,080
- [security] how can I help you?

993
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,180
      - My security system
      seems to be on fritz.

994
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,420
       - Let's check,
       when did it begin?

995
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,170
  - Yeah, it began last night.

996
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,010
     - Sure, your system was
     deactivated at 9:47 pm.

997
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,840
       - What do you mean,
       it's deactivated?

998
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,350
          (tense music)

999
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,290
 - Amelie, I'm on the way. Lock
 the doors and wait for me.

1000
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,290
     Do not open to anyone.

1001
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,720
        It's about fran.

1002
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,120
      See you in a minute.

1003
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,880
        (doorbell rings)

1004
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,290
        (buster panting)

1005
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,890
          (tense music)

1006
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,640
              - Hi.

1007
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,880
      You mentioned you
      had security cameras?

1008
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,470
         - [amelie] yes.

1009
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,250
     - And you can watch the
     footage on your phone?

1010
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,080
             - Yeah.

1011
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,820
             - Fran?

1012
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,820
      - It's not activated.

1013
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,590
     - I forgot to do that.

1014
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,400
      There's something I
      should have told you.

1015
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,330
     After I met with barb,
     I was walking home,

1016
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,830
   And fran offered me a ride.

1017
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,490
    - She was following you?

1018
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,180
     - I didn't think it was
    anything to worry about.

1019
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,410
         She had pizza.

1020
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,910
  She said she was in the area.

1021
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,350
  - She was in my home, amelie.

1022
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,250
     I saw her on the
     security system today.

1023
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,340
     - Your security system?

1024
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,780
     - While you were there.

1025
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,090
     She had your purse, she
    looked dead into camera,

1026
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,850
    She pulled a pin or
    something out of her ear.

1027
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,520
          - It's a pen.

1028
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,110
When she first came to my class,

1029
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,600
       She had ink leaking
       from her bag.

1030
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,370
   And I told her this story,
   I know this sounds stupid,

1031
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,280
    But how I don't carry
    pens in my purse anymore.

1032
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,040
       And then I also
       told her this story

1033
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,040
     About how I spilled
     orange soda in my car.

1034
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,630
        She's been here.

1035
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,030
        Pierce, I, I know
        this sounds nuts,

1036
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,870
     But it's the only thing
     that makes sense. -

1037
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,290
          - Back door?

1038
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,800
    - Yeah, I made sure that
    was locked last night.

1039
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,280
  - But the front door, was
  that open when you got back?

1040
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,550
     - Yes, but it slammed.

1041
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,310
   It was open and then shut,
   like the wind, maybe.

1042
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,640
          There's more.

1043
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,810
   Barb told me she thinks
   she saw fran at the party.

1044
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,730
       She's not sure,
       but she thinks so.

1045
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,740
 - She's following you, pierce.

1046
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,970
   - She's following you, too.

1047
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,990
      This has got to stop.

1048
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,330
     - Who are you calling?

1049
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,980
    - Kip, lead investigator
    on the case.

1050
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,330
      It is out of control.

1051
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,080
    It's going to voicemail.

1052
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,180
    Kip, it's pierce dalton.

1053
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,430
  I need you to call me as
  soon as you can, it's urgent.

1054
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,930
          (tense music)

1055
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,190
            You okay?

1056
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,410
- I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

1057
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,110
   - Let's get some fresh air.

1058
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,600
You know, I grew up around here.

1059
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,770
      - Aren't you english?

1060
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,440
     - What gave that away?

1061
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,880
    No, my dad's an engineer.

1062
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,870
       Got hired by a tech
      firm here in the us,

1063
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,370
      Moved when I was 10.

1064
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,930
       - That must have
       been a big change.

1065
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,210
     - Yeah, but a good one.

1066
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,130
      I really wasn't a fan
      of the cold weather.

1067
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,310
Anyway, my brothers and sisters
used to swim in this ocean.

1068
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,810
  Back in the day it was great.

1069
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,720
   - In montreal, it was just,
   we lived right downtown,

1070
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,730
      So it was just
      concrete city walks.

1071
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,400
       Pierce. I'm scared.

1072
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,740
   - I blame myself for this.

1073
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,140
       Getting you tangled
       up in all this,

1074
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,070
       It's, you just met
       me at a funny time.

1075
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,310
        (buster barking)

1076
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,390
           Is he okay?

1077
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,240
       - Come on, buster.

1078
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,310
  He's just not used to going
  to the bathroom on the beach.

1079
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,730
   - Oh, oh, he needs to pee?

1080
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,320
        - [amelie] yeah.

1081
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,730
    - Yeah, I'll go, take
    him to little boys' room.

1082
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,920
        Come on, come on.

1083
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,670
        (tranquil music)

1084
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,610
         (amelie groans)

1085
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,940
       (suspenseful music)

1086
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,970
         - [amelie] hey.

1087
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,200
             - Hey.

1088
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,290
         - Uh, my head.

1089
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,810
 - [pierce] hey, doc, she's up.

1090
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,950
- Hello, amelie, I'm dr. Neifel.

1091
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,300
  We're happy to see you awake.

1092
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,820
   Do you know where you are?

1093
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,050
       - At the hospital?

1094
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,150
     - That's right, do you
     know how you got here?

1095
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:01,810
          - I was hit.

1096
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,550
       - I'm gonna flash a
       light in your eyes.

1097
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,150
     It's gonna be a little
     bit uncomfortable.

1098
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,320
    Just bear with me, okay?

1099
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,990
Can I have you look to the left?

1100
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:12,990
      And now to the right

1101
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,080
  Great, how do you feel
  about talking to the police?

1102
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,980
       They have some
       questions for you.

1103
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,320
    - What kind of questions?

1104
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,730
       - Just some things
       to jog your memory.

1105
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,320
    - You can use that button
    there if you need me,

1106
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,410
        Just go ahead and
        give it a push.

1107
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,730
            - Thanks.

1108
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,070
          - Excuse me.

1109
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,400
        - Um, listen, if,
       I'm sure they can,

1110
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,430
     If you're not up to it.

1111
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,410
        - No, it's okay.

1112
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,920
  - We're interested to recall

1113
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,170
   If you remember having a
   conversation with the woman

1114
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,340
   The evening of your friend
    barbara gershwin's party.

1115
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,170
    Wondering if you
    remember being approached

1116
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,280
By a woman that you didn't know?

1117
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,690
         - I don't know,

1118
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,350
     I, I talked to a lot of
     people I didn't know.

1119
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,200
        I'm new to town.

1120
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:58,710
  - Is there anyone or anything
  that seemed peculiar?

1121
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,790
     Anything that you could
     think of could help.

1122
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,460
       (suspenseful music)

1123
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,550
       - Is that your car?

1124
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,210
      - I saw fran running
      from that room.

1125
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:28,210
 She had a, a fire bolt earring.

1126
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,230
     She came from the room.

1127
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:34,410
 Pierce, the room I found brian.

1128
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,240
         (dogs barking)

1129
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,320
     Don't hesitate to
     call if he's too much.

1130
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,920
 - And interrupt a weekend away

1131
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,070
       With that tall
       glass of hunkyness?

1132
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:47,490
          Not a chance.

1133
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,980
        - [pierce] ready?

1134
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
     - [amelie] let's do it.

1135
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,500
  - Oh, could you do me a favor
  and toss this in the garbage?

1136
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,830
 I don't wanna sound the alarm,

1137
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,430
        But maybe a mouse
        has been around.

1138
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,250
        I found a pile of
        it in my bathroom

1139
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,990
        And I don't know,

1140
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,250
    Maybe the little critter
    was trying to dig a hole.

1141
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,580
     The property manager's
     gonna send by

1142
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,590
    The exterminator, though.

1143
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,440
Didn't your house get inspected?

1144
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,920
              - No.

1145
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,940
       - But if there's a
       mouse in the house,

1146
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:12,850
   Buster will find it, right?

1147
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,430
         - Yes, he will.

1148
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
  I'll throw this way for you.

1149
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,790
 - Okay, hill up girl, have fun.

1150
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,530
     Just set it next to the
    bin, I'll grab it later.

1151
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,690
     - Thank you, margaret.

1152
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,100
Call if you need anything, okay?

1153
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:23,880
        Anything at all.

1154
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:26,680
       - See you margaret.

1155
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,370
           - Bye now.

1156
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,140
        (tranquil music)

1157
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,310
        (birds chirping)

1158
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,660
     - This place is a
     little slice of heaven.

1159
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,150
   - But if it's heaven,
   then you must be an angel.

1160
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,080
    - That was the cheesiest
     thing you've ever said.

1161
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:57,990
       - Couldn't resist.

1162
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,400
       Yeah, my parents
       discovered the keys

1163
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,920
Right after we moved to florida.

1164
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,810
    Settled in and they
    bought this beach house,

1165
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,230
So I come here as much as I can.

1166
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,010
        - It's beautiful.

1167
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,010
  Hey, can I ask you something?

1168
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,760
           - Anything?

1169
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,510
 - Why do you think fran's
 having a hard time letting go?

1170
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,760
     You said your first
     couple dates were fun.

1171
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,350
     - Yeah, they were fun.

1172
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,520
      She was, she was fun.

1173
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:31,610
      But then she wasn't.

1174
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,870
   This is obsessive behavior
   and I'm not a psychologist.

1175
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:42,130
  I can't begin to understand
  how someone becomes this way.

1176
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,290
      I even felt bad for
      her in the beginning,

1177
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,960
      But now this is, it's
     just gone on too long.

1178
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,960
 I mean our whole relationship,
 if we can call that,

1179
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,460
      Was just three weeks.

1180
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,040
      Yeah, I knew her for
       a year before that.

1181
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,790
   She'd come and go from the
    office, but I don't know,

1182
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,200
        I guess what I'm
        trying to say is

1183
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,890
      It's just all a bit
      unbelievable, really,

1184
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,650
     Getting tangled up
     with someone like her.

1185
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,810
             - Yeah.

1186
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,480
       - How's your head?

1187
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,480
      - It hurts, but
      it's getting better.

1188
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,060
          - You hungry?

1189
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:17,820
        - Getting there.

1190
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,910
        This is so good.

1191
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,470
    - It's never a bad time
    in season for stone crab.

1192
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,900
     - Unless you're a crab.

1193
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:34,330
  (pierce and amelie laughing)

1194
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,330
            Try that.

1195
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,590
              - Mm.

1196
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,510
             - Yeah?

1197
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,260
         - Even better.

1198
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:40,420
        - Does that work?

1199
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,410
          - Of course.

1200
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,510
         - [amelie] hm.

1201
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,270

1202

         - Good morning.

1220
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,590
  - Oh my god, you're stunning.

1221
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,110
         (gentle music)

1222
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,350
         (lips smacking)

1223
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,030
        (waves crashing)

1224
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,290
         (fork banging)

1225
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,880
     - I'm thinking of
     going down to the beach

1226
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,520
   And collecting some shells.

1227
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,300
     - Sounds good, maybe we
    can go snorkeling later.

1228
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,880
       I'm sure we'll find
      an empty conch shell

1229
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,040
    This time of the season.

1230
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,980
      - Mm, I'd love that.

1231
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,210
    - God, I love your lips.

1232
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,790
         (gentle music)

1233
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:21,480
        (waves crashing)

1234
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,330
        - Hey, hey, girl!

1235
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,070
   Hey, beautiful day, right?

1236
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,410
      It's a little windy.

1237
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:42,260
      Oh, I love seashells,
      and dogs, too.

1238
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,060
   It's a shame so many
   people complain about them

1239
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,820
    On the beach, am I right?

1240
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,500
 I always had a cat growing up,

1241
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,570
   So I never thought too
   much about a dog, you know?

1242
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,160
      It's always this like
     love/hate relationship

1243
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,930
        I have with them.

1244
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,340
       But since we're all
      about love recently,

1245
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,600
  I figured we'd go with that.

1246
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,360
       So good to see you.

1247
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:06,760
            - Pierce!

1248
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:07,520
             Pierce!

1249
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,190
       (suspenseful music)

1250
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,030
           She's here!

1251
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,380
            - Where?

1252
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,290
      - She went that way.

1253
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,680
        - [pierce] where?

1254
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,300
       - Yes, yes, she was
       just right there.

1255
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,970
          (tense music)

1256
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,390
   - Pack our things up quick.

1257
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,050
     Let's go back to the
     city as soon possible.

1258
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,050
       (suspenseful music)

1259
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,330
  (suspenseful music continues)

1260
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,160
        Amelie is texting
        the address now.

1261
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:05,660
   - Got it, I'll connect with
   the local authorities now.

1262
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:06,920
 In meantime, you two stay safe.

1263
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:07,830
      - Okay, thanks, kip.

1264
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,430
    - She texted, she locked
     herself out of my place

1265
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,770
       With buster inside?

1266
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,430
  - You left her a key, right?

1267
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,600
- No, I, I didn't think she
would need to get into my place.

1268
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,840
       (brakes screeching)

1269
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,600
  - I am so sorry, sweetheart.

1270
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,520
I don't know how on god's sweet
planet I locked myself out.

1271
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,000
  - How did you even get it in?

1272
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,170
    - Well, the exterminator.

1273
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:35,950
       She said she needed
      to check your place.

1274
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:38,020
            - Buster!

1275
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,870
             Buster!

1276
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,530
             Buster!

1277
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,360
      Fran, outside, said
      something about dogs.

1278
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:46,120
               Ah!

1279
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,460
             Buster!

1280
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,300
              Baby.

1281
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,210
       - There you go,
       baby, there you go.

1282
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,150
      It's okay, it's okay.

1283
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:03,640
        (buster panting)

1284
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,790
       (suspenseful music)

1285
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,540
     - The thumb drive from
     the security cameras

1286
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,900
     The night of the party?

1287
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:09,900
       How'd you get this?

1288
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:13,210
      Barbara said she
      turned off the system

1289
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,130
   For their people's privacy.

1290
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,830
      - They did, but they
      forgot about this one

1291
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,320
      Because it only faces
      the back lane way.

1292
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,230
I should have brought it to
you right away when I found it.

1293
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,170
       - So it's the back
       lane way's footage?

1294
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,240
  - And someone is seen running
  out the back of the house.

1295
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:27,080
       Fits the timeline.

1296
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,240
     - [kip] this will help.

1297
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,900
 - Well, I bloody well hope so.

1298
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,350
     Someone must have seen
     her, know where she is.

1299
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,250
           - We think.

1300
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,340
  - Her computer, did we verify
  that she hacked our system?

1301
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,240
    - Yes, we say it's a
    work computer from work,

1302
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,170
      And her employer has
      denied her access

1303
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,430
     To all of her accounts.

1304
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,430
     Unfortunately, we don't
     have enough just yet

1305
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,190
To issue a warrant for her home,

1306
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:55,610
   But we put eyes out front,
   and this should help.

1307
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,940
       I'm gonna head back
      to the precinct now.

1308
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,770
    She's dangerous, pierce.

1309
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:04,110
      And worse, amelie has
      a target on her back.

1310
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,440
 We're gonna do the best we can,

1311
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,370
      But you're gonna need
      to look out for her.

1312
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,800
       (suspenseful music)

1313
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,050
   - Strengthening your core.

1314
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,060
   Nice, you really wanna
   feel this in your abdomen.

1315
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,370
              Good.

1316
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:26,850
       Now one more pull.

1317
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,400
      That's it, one more.

1318
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,710
        Nice job, ladies.

1319
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,880
      Thank you for
      another great class.

1320
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,470
       Okay, I'll see you
       guys next week.

1321
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,230
        - [barbara] ugh.

1322
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,080
- [amelie] bye, have a good one.

1323
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:43,890
       Thanks for coming.

1324
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,540
      - Hey, are you okay?

1325
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,730
           - I'm fine.

1326
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,990
 - Did you have to get stitches?

1327
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,970
        - Uh, just five.

1328
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:51,250
          - Just five?

1329
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,990
        - Yes, I'm taking
       precautions, barb.

1330
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,590
       - Well, I just
       have one question,

1331
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,650
 Is he really that good in bed?

1332
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,990
     - (laughs) way to make
     light of the situation.

1333
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,420
 - Well, it's a valid question.

1334
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,760
     Oh, someone's ears
     must have been burning.

1335
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,760
           - Hey barb.

1336
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,080
   - Hey, are you doing okay?

1337
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,780
     - Yeah, I'll be better
     when fran's caught.

1338
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,180
      - Yeah, won't we all.

1339
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,280
     Okay, I'm out of here.

1340
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:17,510
       You call me if
       you need anything.

1341
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,860
 - I will, let me walk you out.

1342
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,790
    - [barbara] yeah, thanks.

1343
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:25,950
          (door bangs)

1344
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,450
       - Locking the
       door, that's smart.

1345
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:33,190
     - I just don't want any
     more surprise visits.

1346
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,470
  - Yeah, do you have a minute?

1347
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,960
   - I just finished the last
   of my class, so yeah, sure.

1348
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,810
   Did something else happen?

1349
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,130
              - No.

1350
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:51,650
       (suspenseful music)

1351
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,810
     I don't think we should
     see each other anymore.

1352
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,480
          - Excuse me?

1353
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:05,810
     - It's not, everything
     I've said stands.

1354
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:07,150
             - But?

1355
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,150
    - But this isn't healthy.

1356
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,070
      - For you or for me?

1357
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,840
     - Look at you, amelie.

1358
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,670
    This isn't safe anymore.

1359
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,350
       (melancholy music)

1360
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:23,170
              - No.

1361
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:25,180
              - No?

1362
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,250
        - I'm not letting
        her win, pierce.

1363
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:29,160
   - This isn't about winning.

1364
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,640
    - No, it's about control,

1365
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,830
       And I refuse to let
       fran control me,

1366
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,980
     Or you for that matter.

1367
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,530
   I'm not even scared
   anymore, pierce, I'm angry.

1368
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,370
       (melancholy music)

1369
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,700
Pierce, I can't help but believe

1370
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,220
   That we came into each
   other's lives for a reason.

1371
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,360
       You've opened me up
      in ways that I just,

1372
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,060
    I never thought possible.

1373
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:22,620
       And if we break up,

1374
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,060
     We're just giving her
     exactly what she wants,

1375
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,730
     And when will that end?

1376
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,530
        Pierce, it won't.

1377
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,310
     I'm not gonna lose you.

1378
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:40,840
         - Are you sure?

1379
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,420
           - Kiss me.

1380
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:45,590
     (soft seductive music)

1381
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,440
         (lips smacking)

1382
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,100
     (soft music continues)

1383
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,530
        (car door bangs)

1384
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,430
         (phone chimes)

1385
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,290
       (suspenseful music)

1386
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,800
        (fran screaming)

1387
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,790
        (glass squeaking)

1388
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,640
      It's not coming off.

1389
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:32,150
       - Here, let me
       have a go at that.

1390
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:35,620
        (doorbell rings)

1391
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,310
        (birds chirping)

1392
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,490
        - I'll check the
        security camera.

1393
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,650
    Okay, it's just margaret.

1394
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,220
              - Hi.
              - Hi.

1395
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:52,400
   I hope I'm not disturbing.

1396
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,660
        - Of course not.

1397
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,890
       - I made a lasagna
       and I had extra.

1398
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:57,080
   Thought you might enjoy it.

1399
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,140
     - That's so thoughtful
     of you, thank you.

1400
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:00,670
       Wanna come in,
       join us for dinner?

1401
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,330
    - I'd love to, but my
    show starts in 10 minutes

1402
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:05,390
      And it's the finale.

1403
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,560
- Mm, you can't miss the finale.

1404
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,580
   - I do this remote viewing
   party with my sister

1405
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,930
        On the computer.

1406
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,830
    It's just kind our thing.

1407
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,340
   - I'm gonna make a salad,
   and we'll bring you a bowl.

1408
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,420
         I'll text you.

1409
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,100
     - No rush, sweetheart.

1410
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:17,850
         Bye bye.
         - [amelie] bye.

1411
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:23,180
          (door bangs)

1412
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,420
       (suspenseful music)

1413
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,980
   (man speaking indistinctly)

1414
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:35,370
         I'm so excited.

1415
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:37,530
       It's gonna be good.

1416
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,880
  - [man] different priorities,
  different priorities.

1417
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:48,540
    (indistinct) from the us.

1418
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,700
       (computer chiming)

1419
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,710
        - There you are.

1420
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:53,290
     Got your dinner ready?

1421
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,950
    - [sister] mm-hm, yes,
    ma'am, warming it up now.

1422
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:56,970
   - I'm doing the same thing.

1423
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,720
     This is gonna be good.

1424
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,140
          I can't wait!

1425
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,350
     - [sister] it's gonna
     be great. I can't wait.

1426
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,280
      (margaret screaming)

1427
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,730
 - [sister] margaret, margaret!

1428
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:15,490
      - There, okay, the
      store on the corner.

1429
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,910
 - You're looking for
 something to clean the mirror?

1430
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,140
     - Yeah, it's just the
     vinegar wasn't working.

1431
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,320
         (fran groaning)

1432
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,090
        (dramatic music)

1433
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,510
         (fran panting)

1434
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:44,100
         (boots banging)

1435
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,680
       (suspenseful music)

1436
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:51,100
          (fran groans)

1437
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,440
          (tense music)

1438
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,030
    - Hey, I really think
    you should go for a run.

1439
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:09,450
- Yeah, I just don't think it's
a good idea leaving you here

1440
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,850
     By yourself right now.

1441
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:12,370
 - Hey, hey, I'll be okay, okay?

1442
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,030
        You'll be quick.

1443
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,040
Plus, we need the glass cleaner,
so you can pick some up.

1444
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,640
         (fran panting)

1445
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,220
         - Are you sure?

1446
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,140
           - I'm sure.

1447
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:30,630
        - Lock the door.

1448
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,320
        - I will, I will.

1449
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:35,330
       (suspenseful music)

1450
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:43,140
          (door bangs)

1451
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,830
         (ominous music)

1452
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,920
   - Have you heard anything?

1453
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:00,510
   - No, nothing yet, but the
   locks have been changed

1454
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,680
    And police are
    monitoring fran's house.

1455
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:04,500
        - You're not home
        alone, are you?

1456
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,350
      - No, pierce is here.

1457
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,930
       - Man of the hour.

1458
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,260
    Now when you say he's
    there, he's there, there?

1459
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,930
     - Technically, no, but
     he'll be back soon.

1460
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,780
       (suspenseful music)

1461
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,530
        (pierce panting)

1462
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:31,130
  (suspenseful music continues)

1463
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,300
      - [fran] why are you
      doing this to me?

1464
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:41,380
          - Whoa, fran!

1465
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,610
  - You said that you love me.

1466
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,950
       - Okay, we've been
       over this, okay?

1467
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:50,450
   - You said that you love
   the way that I touched you.

1468
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:53,470
 - No, I love nothing about you.

1469
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,050
Let me be crystal clear on that.

1470
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,230
    - She is a whore, pierce,

1471
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:58,990
        And I see the way
        she touches you,

1472
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,220
      And she thinks that
      no one's watching me,

1473
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,410
         And guess what?

1474
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,890
           Guess what?

1475
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,800
       I've been watching
       this whole time

1476
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,750
       And everything she
       does infuriates me,

1477
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,230
       And everything you
        do infuriates me.

1478
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,160
    - You need to stop this.

1479
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,310
            Stop it.

1480
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:16,420
 - You make me so angry, pierce.

1481
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,750
      It's like I see red.

1482
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:20,090
    You do this to me!
    - You need to calm down.

1483
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,330
      - You do this to me!
      - Calm down!

1484
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:23,590
        Calm down, okay?

1485
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,760
     - I thought it was you.

1486
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:29,430
            - Brian?

1487
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,420
     - He dressed like you,
     he, he looked like you,

1488
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,020
    He even smelled like you.

1489
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,770
          - Were you...

1490
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,840
       - He took his hands
       down my pants.

1491
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,280
       - Well, so what,
       so you killed him?

1492
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:43,860
      - Yes, I killed him.

1493
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,280
     I didn't have a choice

1494
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,680
       Because you weren't
      there to protect me.

1495
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:51,120
      - Okay, I'm gonna
      walk away right now.

1496
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,940
    Don't you dare follow me.

1497
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,290
       - Do not walk away
       from me, pierce.

1498
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,460
      - What are you doing?

1499
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,640
        - If I can't have
        you, no one will.

1500
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,450
      She cannot have you!

1501
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:05,540
        (pierce screams)

1502
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,950
         (fran screams)

1503
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:09,970
          - Stop, stop!

1504
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:11,880
        - Help!
        - [pierce] stop!

1505
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:12,970
          - [man] hey!

1506
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:13,970
    - Help, he's got a knife!

1507
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:14,900
        He's got a knife!

1508
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:15,960
          - [man] stop!

1509
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,200
          (punch thuds)

1510
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:18,570
        (pierce groaning)

1511
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,710
        (dramatic music)

1512
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:21,130
        (pierce groaning)

1513
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:21,830
        - Get off of me!

1514
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,400
       - [man] hold still!

1515
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:24,650
  - She's wanted by the police!

1516
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,560
       - Stop fighting me.

1517
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,240
        (dramatic music)

1518
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:34,160
        (pierce groaning)

1519
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,170
       (suspenseful music)

1520
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,770
         (ominous music)

1521
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,600
       (doorbell ringing)

1522
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:09,010
    - Yeah, I'm at the park,
     at the corner of fifth.

1523
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,210
  I'm holding down a white
  male, approximately six one.

1524
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,290
       He just attacked a
       woman with a knife.

1525
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,380
  - Fran gibbons, fran gibbons.

1526
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,450
     Just tell them the
     woman is fran gibbons.

1527
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,290
 - Send an officer now, please.

1528
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,940
          - Tell them!

1529
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,960
        (pierce groaning)

1530
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:26,470
          (tense music)

1531
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,640
         (phone ringing)

1532
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,290
      - [margaret's voice]
      hi, this is margaret.

1533
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,980
     Please leave a message.

1534
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,490
          (tense music)

1535
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,070
     - [man] I really loved.

1536
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,060
           - Margaret?

1537
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:46,890
 - [man] incredibly supportive,

1538
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,320
     We gotta find somebody

1539
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:50,320
       That's gonna put up
      with your stupidity.

1540
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:51,970
           - Margaret!

1541
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:54,070
   - [man] and really help
   you accomplish your dreams.

1542
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,890
 - Margaret, I have your salad!

1543
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,740
   - [man] never thought you'd
   be able to accomplish.

1544
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:02,080
    (smoke detector beeping)

1545
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:08,670
        (oven door bangs)

1546
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,830
            Margaret!

1547
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:10,670
         Where are you?

1548
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,250
          Are you okay?

1549
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,160
    (smoke detector beeping)

1550
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,820
     - [man] I thought you'd
     be able to accomplish,

1551
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,660
     And even the short time
     we've spent together.

1552
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,520
 (margaret yelling indistinctly)

1553
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,260
          (door clicks)

1554
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,760
       (margaret moaning)

1555
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,440
     - Oh my god, margaret!

1556
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,950
       Margaret, oh my
       god, what happened?

1557
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:37,270
      - She had some stuff
       that knocked me out

1558
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,440
     So just leave me here.

1559
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,460
          - Go, go now.

1560
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,200
     - [man] even the short
     time we together.

01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,580
     - [kip] amelie, I need
      you to lock the doors

1573
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,350
  And get into a safe location.

1574
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,020
     - Where would that be?

1575
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,750
  - [kip] I have reason to
  believe you are in harms way.

1576
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,330
   Please, just do what I say.

1577
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:40,180
      - Harms way? By who?

1578
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,310
      - [kip] hello? Hello!

1579
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:45,590
             Amelie!

1580
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,340
   - [amelie] come on, buster,
   come here baby, come on.

         (fran screams)

1589
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,580
     - [fran] I know who you
    are, I know what you do.

1590
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:44,970
       - You don't know
       anything about me.

1591
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:47,420
    - You are a stupid whore.

1592
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,240
       - [amelie] I'm not.

1593
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:52,340
  - Exactly what my father
  used to call women like you.

1594
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,500
       - [amelie] I'm not.

1595
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:56,320
  Fran, I promise you I'm not.

1596
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:58,000
      - Did he tell you
      how perfect we were,

1597
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,330
      Did he tell you that?

1598
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,930
         - Fran, he did.

1599
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:05,250
  - He told me and all these
  women just kept interfering.

1600
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:06,830
         (fran screams)

1601
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:08,400
       And I know I was
       so good to be true.

1602
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,830
   Everyone just kept telling
   him lies and lies about me.

1603
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:16,000
      - I don't think
      that's what happened.

1604
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,190
           - Shut up!

1605
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,190
     That is what happened!

1606
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,180
      I know what happened!

1607
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,800
   - This needs to end, fran.

1608
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,860
     - You can't keep
     living like this, okay?

1609
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:29,370
    I'll help you, I promise.

1610
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,540
    I promise I'll help you.

1611
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:32,250
     - You took him from me.

1612
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:38,300
    - He's not a possession,
    fran, he's a person.

1613
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,370
        - [fran] person?

1614
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:40,140
   - He's an ordinary person.

1615
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,310
          - He's mine!

1616
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,100
           He's mine!

1617
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,140
           He's mine!

1618
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,960

        (waves crashing)

1629
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,990
       (melancholy music)

1630
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,060
       - [pierce] amelie!

1631
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,530
   What did you do, fran, huh?

1632
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:01,940
        What did you do?

1633
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,630
      - She was trying, she
     was trying to kill me.

1634
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,720
   I'm a victim here, not her.

1635
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,560
         I'm the victim!

1636
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:13,900
        (pierce panting)

1637
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,410
    Don't you see
    everything I did for us?

1638
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,080
        (waves crashing)

1639
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:25,410
  - Fran, get your hands up
  and your knees on the ground.

1640
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:27,740
        Hands up, I said!

1641
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,720
    Get an ambulance, quick!

1642
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:38,660
   It's over, fran, it's over.

1643
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,220
      - I did this for us.

1644
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,920
       - [pierce] amelie!

1645
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:46,600
        (pierce groaning)

1646
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,670
- [kip] pierce, get her up here!

1647
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:51,430
       Help is on the way.

1648
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,770
 - I did all all of this for us!

1649
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,110
     - Fran gibbons, you are
     arrested for the murder

1650
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:00,930
       Of brian fletcher.

1651
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:01,850
       You have the right
        to remain silent.

1652
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,520
      - You did this to me!

1653
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:03,960
   - Whatever you say can and
   will be used against you

1654
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:06,930
      In the court of law.

1655
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:08,770
       You have the right
       to an attorney.

1656
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:10,340
       (melancholy music)

1657
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:13,090
        (water splashing)

        (pierce panting)

1660
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,480
       (suspenseful music)

1661
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:32,630
      - Pushing those
      legs out, very nice.

1662
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,140
Make sure the small of your back

1663
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:35,550
 Is really tucked into the mat.

1664
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,470
       Nice job, two more.

1665
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,960
 - Oh my god, I'm going to die!

1666
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:43,000
        Uh, pilates-style
       speaking, that is.

1667
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,390
       (barbara groaning)

1668
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:47,280
      - Great going, great
       job, and that's it.

1669
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:49,640
         Nice job today.

1670
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,880
       Thanks for another
       fantastic class.

1671
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:52,460
       I will see you guys
       next week, okay?

1672
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:54,840
      Good job today, bye.

1673
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,010
    - Ah, you're not gonna
    keep that there, are you?

1674
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,580
      - No, no, just until
      we finish moving in.

1675
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,080
  - Moving in, it's a big step.

1676
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,160
           - Sure is.

1677
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:09,570
 - Oh, look at you, swooshin' in

1678
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:12,920
   And snatchin' up the city's
   most eligible bachelor.

1679
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,590
  - Not without a fight, barb.

1680
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,840
      - Well, that is true.

1681
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,750
         (amelie laughs)

1682
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,750
      - Mm, would it be
      highly inappropriate

1683
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,940
     If I were to request a
      private pilates class

1684
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:26,990
        With you and him?

1685
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,990
     - Considering that it's
    called a private, maybe.

1686
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,110
      - Oh, please, pierce,

1687
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:37,190
   Don't feel the need to put
    a shirt on on my account.

1688
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:39,210
     - Putting it on because
     that one's dirty.

1689
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,710
       - Mm, he's cheeky.

1690
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,340
       - Okay, bye, barb.

1691
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:48,710
    - Okay, okay, never know,

1692
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,460
   I might sign up for my own
    lesson some day. (laughs)

1693
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:53,540
        - Bye!
        - [barbara] bye!

1694
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,720
        (amelie laughing)

1695
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,480
        - How did he do?

1696
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:59,210
   - Great, stopped every five
   seconds to pee on a flower,

1697
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:01,570
     But otherwise a runner.

1698
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:05,580
       - I think I prefer
        you without that.

1699
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:07,900
           - Mm, okay.

1700
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,060
     If you're finished with
     your classes for today.

1701
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,470
 - I just have one more private

1703
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,000

1705
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,090
