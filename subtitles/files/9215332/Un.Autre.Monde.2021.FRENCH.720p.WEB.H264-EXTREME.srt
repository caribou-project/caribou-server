1
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:19,673
ANOTHER WORLD

2
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:20,807
So...

3
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,958
She owns a first home

4
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,802
with a living area
of 130 square meters

5
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,610
and a lot
of 2,600 square meters,

6
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:31,302
with an estimated value
of €700,000.

7
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:36,174
A second home
of 95 square meters,

8
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:40,742
with one hectare of land,
of an estimated value of €550,000.

9
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,583
Different bank accounts:

10
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,979
a securities deposit
with assets of €35,674;

11
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:50,780
a deposit account
with assets of €15,300;

12
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:54,423
a current account
with assets of €12,000;

13
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:57,992
a life insurance policy
of €201,624;

14
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:02,994
for an overall value
of €264,598.

15
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:09,471
The compensation claim takes into account
the loss of career opportunities.

16
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,942
My client and I have estimated

17
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:18,021
that such compensation
should amount to €375,000.

18
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:19,200
Unless...

19
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,367
the duration of that
loss of opportunity

20
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:25,037
does not match the
whole duration of marriage,

21
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:28,495
since Madam has started
working again since three years.

22
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,345
On the first day of the wedding,

23
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:37,912
my client's employment foreshadowed
a very promising professional path.

24
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:44,606
Madam sacrificed her career
to follow Mr. Lemesle's

25
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,585
in all his duties,

26
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,314
in France and abroad.

27
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,204
So she closed
the door to her career.

28
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:54,200
It was a real sacrifice.

29
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:58,885
Today, at the time of their divorce,
because that's what we're talking about,

30
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,037
That choice has a price.

31
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,274
Of course, of course,
it has a price.

32
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,200
I do not dispute
the division of property,

33
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:09,477
but I do not accept
unfair treatment.

34
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:11,945
€375,000 is a lot of money,

35
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:14,825
I feel drained...

36
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:17,579
The amount is calculated
on your current income...

37
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:21,979
But I've been hearing
from the beginning the word 'sacrifice'.

38
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,158
Like I'm the villain here.

39
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:27,325
- Nobody said that.
- You insinuated it.

40
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,659
That's the insinuation.

41
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:33,785
There is no reason
that I must lose more than you.

42
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:35,809
I'm not saying otherwise.

43
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,829
We are here to
think about the future.

44
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,561
Precisely.

45
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,636
Mr. Lemesle has already
accepted the divorce.

46
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:45,750
If we talk about the future,

47
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,411
we can not put the whole burden on him.
He should not be penalized twice.

48
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:52,744
The same thing
goes for my client,

49
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:57,079
Especially since her life has been hell
for the last seven years.

50
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,611
- Hell?
- Yes, hell.

51
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,912
In this case, excuse me, but...

52
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:04,412
she should change her request.

53
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,409
Don't ask for €375,000.

54
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:10,245
If it was hell,
then ask for €8,000,000. Please!

55
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:11,676
Or even €10,000,000!

56
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,829
She told you
that I made her life hell?

57
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,251
Is this what she told you?

58
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:17,876
Anne?

59
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,890
Did I make your life hell?

60
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:23,065
- Mr. Lemesle...
- Please wait...

61
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,079
Did I make your life hell?
Answer me.

62
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:29,515
- I suggest you avoid...
- No, let me explain.

63
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,598
No, I'm sorry,
I can't allow this...

64
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,603
Let's avoid the emotional road.

65
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:37,163
I'll do that next, but now...

66
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:39,824
I won't let you say
that I made your life hell.

67
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,958
No, I worked.

68
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,776
They offered me responsibilities
with an important company group,

69
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,878
I accepted them
and I had to work hard.

70
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:48,492
It was a lot of work. A lot.

71
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:50,408
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

72
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:53,825
Good...
That brought money into the house.

73
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:57,617
And you benefited from it
as much as I did.

74
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,032
You can't deny it.

75
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:00,973
I don't deny it.

76
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:04,943
Before accepting the job,
we talked about it many times,

77
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:08,798
and you knew exactly
what awaited us.

78
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:12,661
Sir, I guarantee you
that my client recognizes it,

79
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:15,367
but that's not the point.

80
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:18,411
But you must understand
that for seven years,

81
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:22,370
since you took over
the management of the plant,

82
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:25,162
you brought your problems home.

83
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:28,329
- This is the truth.
- But this is not why we are here.

84
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,454
The purpose of this meeting, sir,
to discuss the divorce settlement.

85
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:33,984
This is not family therapy.

86
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:36,827
Neither it is the place nor
the objective of this meeting.

87
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,870
I agree,
but I want to say one thing.

88
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,402
I never said....

89
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,869
that accepting this job
would be easy.

90
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,109
I never said that.

91
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:49,964
We have discussed this many times,
I have never said that.

92
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:54,267
But my client wasn't supposed to
suffer for your career choice.

93
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,534
That's not fair.

94
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,950
Suffer?

95
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,485
But she also enjoyed the benefits.

96
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,704
- What you are saying is shameful.
- How?

97
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:04,908
I didn't sign up for you to
bring your problems home.

98
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:06,357
This was not the deal.

99
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:08,662
You talked about more work. I said:

100
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:12,420
"Ok, I'll manage my daily life
despite your absence",

101
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:14,037
but I didn't expect this chaos.

102
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,909
She's berating me for my absence

103
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:19,930
and for letting you
manage your daily life?

104
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,673
You were never really there.

105
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,500
- That's not true.
- Ah, yes?

106
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:29,451
How many weekends we spent
together in recent years?

107
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:33,326
- I don't keep track of weekends.
- I do. Six.

108
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,930
Six in two years.
Not even a night together.

109
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,704
I'm talking about
the last few years,

110
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:41,313
but our family fell apart
much earlier.

111
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,303
You were constantly stressed...

112
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,161
Sorry...
What should I have done?

113
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:01,564
I'm sorry,
but I can't write off both

114
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:04,492
my private life and
my professional life.

115
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,325
I will not lose on both fronts.

116
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,550
I was very clear,
I have never deceived you.

117
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,654
I've never lied to you.

118
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:17,245
I said it would be hard until
the Elsonn Group had achieved its goals.

119
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:20,329
So I depend on the Elsonn Group.
I live with them.

120
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,879
- I'm married to Elsonn!
- I'm not saying that.

121
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,250
I have suffered for years,

122
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,606
listening only about tensions, anxieties
and complaints about your work.

123
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,745
Philippe, I'm almost 50!

124
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,688
I have more years behind me
than in front of me, isn't it so?

125
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,680
I have done my share.

126
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:51,291
The main question
is not how to succeed,

127
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,220
again cutting 10%
of the workforce, in this context.

128
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:57,955
Rather, it is how to deal with
a contradiction that is, new cuts.

129
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,099
A new economic plan

130
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:04,311
in a context where the factory
and the company are profitable,

131
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,287
and also the Group, Philippe.

132
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,992
A contradiction
which will generate conflicts.

133
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:11,829
You raise a question

134
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:16,887
that the Group has not asked us
to answer, nor to think about.

135
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,787
But they ask us to do a job.

136
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:22,046
We have the right to ask about...

137
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:25,454
the consequences,
we are not mere executors.

138
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:28,412
The Group asks this,
like it or not, so we have to do it.

139
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:30,871
And I'll tell you right away:
we will respond.

140
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:34,935
To put things back in context,
when Elsonn acquired us

141
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,212
we were 603 men,
today we are 508.

142
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:38,960
We can make everything up, but...

143
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,457
Alexandre,
that's not what this is about.

144
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:45,767
Spare us the story,
we were all there, we know the numbers.

145
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:49,917
It's not a history lesson
but the numbers are important.

146
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:53,204
We have to lay off 58 employees.
That's not a little.

147
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:56,537
Today I would just like to say:
But no more layoffs in my department.

148
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:57,824
You can look elsewhere,

149
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,929
like in the communication area,
where they seem a little more relaxed.

150
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,492
- Sorry?
- No, Sayid...

151
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:06,012
- Can you specify?
- Sayid, please.

152
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:07,326
Sayid, wait.

153
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:10,289
I don't want to hear this.
We don't stab each other in the back..

154
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,704
- We're not going to do that.
- I'm just saying...

155
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:16,704
I just want to remind you that
in the hyper-competitive sector,

156
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:19,496
the production of parts
for household appliances,

157
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:22,371
you have to perform to the maximum
and must be very competitive.

158
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:26,037
If we want to continue
to produce revenues and results,

159
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:28,143
we shouldn't fire engineers anymore.

160
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:30,702
I have no elbow room at all
in my department.

161
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:33,097
- We understood.
- I hope so.

162
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:39,162
Can I ask Alexandre to be more specific
when he mentioned Communication?

163
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,362
I say what everyone thinks.

164
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,083
If we want to stay on track,
I repeat it one last time:

165
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,343
let's not stab each other in the back.
And we don't tear each other down, clear?

166
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:53,116
This looks like a repeat
from two and a half years ago.

167
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,347
You are doing
exactly the same thing.

168
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:59,763
The Group asks for a layoff plan
and you start with the same song:

169
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:03,225
'If we are going to
downsize departments, it will be chaos.'

170
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:08,784
We move the administration to Poland,
or another department to Portugal.

171
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,825
There are solutions,
other companies do it...

172
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,073
Easy to say "we relocate".

173
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:17,020
Stop, please, stop.

174
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:20,830
We won't go in Julie's direction,
I assure you.

175
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,163
Not in that direction.

176
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:26,224
I need to have
the maximum of services on site.

177
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:27,541
No relocation.

178
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:31,075
But at least someone
made a proposal.

179
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,829
What I want: that you
do proposals and find solutions.

180
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,830
- Is that clear?
- Philippe.

181
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:38,758
- I just want to say one thing.
- Say it.

182
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,738
What I want to say is

183
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:44,797
that Alexandre has perhaps
the brightest engineers on earth...

184
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:49,496
Don't tear it down. Say what you
have to say without attacking others.

185
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:54,625
We will do our part, we will do...
the task that is required of us,

186
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,113
but let it be clear:

187
00:12:56,403 --> 00:13:01,887
Communication won't do any more
than the rest of my colleagues here.

188
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:05,528
Great,
because no one asked you that.

189
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:08,527
- Then it's perfect.
- I need solutions.

190
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:12,710
If we had six months, I wouldn't worry.
There would be no problems.

191
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,992
But we don't have them.

192
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:16,871
We have nine weeks,
actually even less.

193
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,996
It's eight weeks because
I have asked about this since last week.

194
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,681
I have a meeting
with the general management,

195
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,829
I need a report to present
and I have nothing for them.

196
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,446
In these eight weeks
the message is simple:

197
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:32,767
we work, we seek
and we find solutions.

198
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,608
And without leaks,

199
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:39,274
because
when the unions hear this,

200
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:41,534
I tell you,
it will be a disaster.

201
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,798
Then it really gets chaotic.

202
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,367
Hi, Lucas, it's dad.

203
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,843
I saw you called me.
Sorry, I was at work.

204
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,905
You have to prepare for your exams,
Call me back when you can.

205
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,782
You know
what I'm going to tell you.

206
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:38,876
I read it...

207
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,137
We are far from our goals.

208
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:42,899
Are you aware of it?

209
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,250
My answer is there,

210
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,492
I have nothing else to offer you
than my findings.

211
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:51,095
So what do we do?

212
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:56,173
I'm sorry but we will have to
write something else,

213
00:14:56,326 --> 00:15:00,483
because I can't present your conclusions
to the general management.

214
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:01,992
I cannot.

215
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:05,829
I cannot give...
a distorted picture.

216
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:08,911
This is a serious,
coherent report from the figures,

217
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,085
which seems to me
to be consistent.

218
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,924
I did my math...

219
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:17,069
I can cut a few jobs here and there,

220
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:20,742
but the number they ask,
is impossible.

221
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:24,211
This is not the first time they have
asked for staff reductions, right?

222
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,646
You usually have the answers.
Why don't you have them now?

223
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,329
- I can find solutions...
- Good.

224
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,246
...but they would be wrong.

225
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:37,205
They would jeopardize
the well-being of our employees.

226
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,949
Don't blackmail me
with the employees' well-being.

227
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,717
- It's not blackmail.
- Yes, I don't want to go there.

228
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:47,532
You know well
that's not how I work.

229
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:52,209
They ask me to give up 58 people
and you give me 30.

230
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,528
30!

231
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:57,079
- I can give you 200 if you want...
- I don't want 200, I want 58.

232
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,897
Seriously, Philippe,

233
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:03,871
next time you go to Paris
to talk to Mrs. Bonnet-Guérin,

234
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:06,897
you should calmly explain to her

235
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:10,534
what can and cannot
be done in a company.

236
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:15,943
If I have to sacrifice 58 people
to save 500, then I sacrifice 58.

237
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,617
Think you'll save 500?

238
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,996
That won't happen,
but you don't get that.

239
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:23,403
You won't save them,
because they will explode.

240
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:25,537
I see them in my office every day.

241
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,315
You mean the weakest.

242
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,412
The weakest?
Do you realize what you're saying?

243
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:36,561
When they came to this company,
they weren't vulnerable at all.

244
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,287
They are weakened
by the constant pressure

245
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:40,967
which
has been going on for years.

246
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,371
They were
perfectly competent people,

247
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,761
who have
always accepted every challenge.

248
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,140
You work with them from morning
to night. You know it well.

249
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:52,685
- Olivier, stop.
- You're losing your grip, Philippe.

250
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:56,621
We have to be competitive,
otherwise we are finished.

251
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:59,843
But this is not feasible.
Not realistic.

252
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,652
Their demands are not realistic.

253
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:20,242
You must think
I can't make a decision.

254
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:30,607
With the lawyers
it's all a question of money.

255
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:33,777
When they talk,

256
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:37,358
I get the impression
that it's not about us.

257
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:46,024
We are left behind
just because of the money.

258
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,757
"I did this,
you did that..."

259
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:01,974
"Who has done more,
who has done less..."

260
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,159
I'm here, calm down.

261
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,738
This is how these things happen.

262
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,891
You'll think I'm only
interested in money.

263
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:12,955
Not at all.

264
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:19,626
Come on

265
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,286
I'm freaking out, you see?

266
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:28,039
Because I don't know
what will become of me.

267
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:33,409
I feel useless,

268
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:35,435
I'm ridiculous.

269
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,876
You are not useless, you're not.

270
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:42,034
We will find a way.

271
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,788
- I don't give a damn about money.
- I know it.

272
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:54,009
You will say what you can afford
and that's what it will be.

273
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:58,931
I am so stupid.

274
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,032
Come on, don't worry.

275
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:12,871
I shouldn't have called you.

276
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,829
I say one thing and do another.

277
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,897
I'm sorry, I'm useless.

278
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,418
It will pass.

279
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:41,954
Sorry, I shouldn't have called you.

280
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:45,312
It is ridiculous,
it doesn't make any sense.

281
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,911
No...

282
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:50,058
It is so nice
to have a date in a parking lot.

283
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:51,928
I like it.

284
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,845
We will announce the plan to the markets
in six weeks.

285
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,871
You have had enough time
to refine your conclusions.

286
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:22,951
I have read interesting angles,

287
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:26,583
some are near-final proposals,
others are a little less so,

288
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,288
hence we have this meeting.

289
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,188
Didier, do you want to start?

290
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,493
It is a very ambitious plan.

291
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:36,621
There will certainly be friction
with the trade union once announced.

292
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,913
Saying this,

293
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:41,209
one of the big union leaders
left the company.

294
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,024
He retired last year.

295
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,202
So we can do it.

296
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,409
Ok. Christophe?

297
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,146
I'm sorry
to spoil the party a little,

298
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:55,563
but we are asked
to get better results

299
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:59,451
with 10% less staff...

300
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:01,996
It doesn't make any sense,
it's impossible.

301
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,954
'Impossible'.
I don't want to hear it.

302
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:07,204
The British and
the Poles are ready.

303
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,538
They are not alarmed
by this requirement.

304
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:12,996
The Germans, as usual,
want to prove they are the strongest.

305
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:15,954
The Dutch will do their job,
I know them.

306
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,076
They manage, without complaining,
staying on time,

307
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,243
no problems, it will be perfect.

308
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:23,579
And the Americans
are already doing it.

309
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:25,582
It is out of the question
for France

310
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,329
to emerge as the black sheep
in this operation.

311
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:30,108
Tell me, Claire,

312
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:34,416
at the Las Vegas convention
two months ago,

313
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:36,785
when Mr. Cooper and the Board...

314
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,776
highlighted the positive numbers
of these last three years,

315
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:44,638
you were there,
you heard that.

316
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:46,125
Now Cooper himself says that

317
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:51,159
we can increase profits
by two percent in a year?

318
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:54,163
You know me,
I'm not really a socialist,

319
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,583
but what he asks of us

320
00:22:55,666 --> 00:23:01,471
clearly serves to increase
shareholder dividends,

321
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:06,868
at the expense of work quality
at our factories.

322
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:08,071
That is obvious.

323
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:12,048
If you can fool the market,
we are all ears.

324
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:14,546
That is beyond my expertise.

325
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,666
On the other hand,

326
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:20,538
I would like for once to hear
what the Americans tell us.

327
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:22,034
As Cooper says:

328
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:25,765
"Always think bigger than you are."

329
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,359
Mrs. Bonnet-Guérin,
may I have a moment?

330
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:30,496
I would like to remind Mr. Garousse

331
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:35,575
that outsourcing of the sector
appliances is very competitive.

332
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:39,038
- We can't play victims.
- I'm not doing that.

333
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,618
I'm just telling you
that the cuts you ask us

334
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:46,816
will be synonymous with difficulty
for certain sites...

335
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,513
I would say in all factories.

336
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:52,427
And not only in France,
even abroad.

337
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,489
For me, in Strasbourg,

338
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,492
for Philippe, for Denis
and for you, Jean-Pierre.

339
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:01,337
No offense,
but you are speaking for yourself.

340
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,621
We don't all share your opinion.

341
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,829
If we don't take
our responsibilities,

342
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,038
if we don't do our job,
if you don't,

343
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:12,121
the responsibility will be ours,

344
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:16,284
because it will be our fault,
our lack of courage and intelligence.

345
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:20,451
But maybe this is
the scenario you want.

346
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,993
{\an8}TODAY

347
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,910
{\an8}is the day when

348
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:32,785
{\an8}YOU

349
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:36,076
{\an8}are THE KING

350
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:40,618
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD!

351
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:44,701
<i>Hi, daddy,
I just woke up here,</i>

352
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:48,526
<i>while in France you are
already in the middle of the day.</i>

353
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:51,451
<i>I wanted to tell you that
I think about you a lot</i>

354
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:54,455
<i>and I wish you all the best
on your birthday.</i>

355
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,285
<i>I guess you'll celebrate
with your friends.</i>

356
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,460
<i>I hope you're doing well.</i>

357
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:08,111
<i>I send a lot of big kisses
from across the Atlantic</i>

358
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:11,038
<i>and big hugs for your birthday.</i>

359
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,743
<i>Big kisses!</i>

360
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,575
Who allowed it?

361
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:53,307
Who allowed it?

362
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:56,871
Excuse me, sir,

363
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:02,141
maybe it was the only way
she could produce such quantities.

364
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:04,300
I already said that
safety is not a choice.

365
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:07,416
Now I have to
tell headquarters:

366
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,701
"Hi, good news!

367
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:13,383
Ms Evrard blocked the device's security
and she lost her arm!"

368
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,868
Do I have to tell them that?

369
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:19,076
I'm just telling you how things are
for us here everyday.

370
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,984
Everyone knows those lines.

371
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:25,163
They are programmed to
produce a number of parts,

372
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:27,086
incorporating safety breaks.

373
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,263
Yes or no?

374
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:31,621
And, Mrs. Storti,

375
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:33,160
speaking clearly,

376
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:38,176
did you see someone disable a security,
and you did nothing?

377
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:41,416
If there is an anomaly,
I intervene immediately.

378
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,303
Apparently not.
You did not!

379
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:47,132
I intervene when there is a risk!
But I can't see everything.

380
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,163
What Jacqueline has done
was indeed wrong,

381
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,673
but for many girls,

382
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:55,701
and above all,
for those of a certain age,

383
00:26:55,832 --> 00:26:58,707
the scheduled breaks
are no longer...

384
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,663
they are no longer enough.

385
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:03,746
Sorry. I don't want to hear it.

386
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:06,038
- They're too short.
- I can't listen to this.

387
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:07,496
I want to say something.

388
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:11,660
I respect you,
but you are not being honest.

389
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:15,021
People work hard on those lines.

390
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:18,746
They love their job and they
do try their best to keep going.

391
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:21,576
I do my best too.

392
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:26,080
I also want it to go on.
And as long as possible.

393
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,538
A company is not made up of numbers,
but of workers.

394
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:30,913
- First of all, people.
- Don't lecture me.

395
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:32,743
You see it under your nose.

396
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:34,992
I know my factory.

397
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:38,063
It is not true, you do not
come to the workshop.

398
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:39,605
You are no longer seen.

399
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:41,180
- It is false.
- That's it.

400
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,305
What are you waiting for?

401
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:45,607
That people get exhausted?
Someone kills himself?

402
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,138
What are you waiting for?

403
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:40,102
I want to reassure you
about your son.

404
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,502
He is resting.

405
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:46,660
We'll keep him here with us
for a few days

406
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:49,965
to understand exactly
what happened.

407
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:54,660
He insulted his teacher.
But not only that.

408
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,720
He also threatened him
with a compass,

409
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,118
uttering insults.

410
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:04,618
He spoke incoherently.

411
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,576
Very confused.

412
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,707
That's why we brought him here.

413
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:14,576
He came to the emergency room
where I examined him

414
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:19,506
and as we talked,
his anger subsided.

415
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:25,727
That anger was mainly
directed at that teacher,

416
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:28,721
but really had nothing
to do with him.

417
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:33,826
There is mental fatigue,
of course,

418
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:39,785
there are things that
his brain is unable to process.

419
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,295
I think...

420
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:46,368
it would be good
if he could be at some clinic

421
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,429
anywhere close to your home.

422
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:56,743
Keep in mind
that we don't know everything,

423
00:29:56,868 --> 00:29:59,868
we don't have the answers yet.

424
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,593
We are not omnipotent.

425
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:06,535
So we have to
approach this with humility.

426
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:10,160
Humility is essential,

427
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:14,073
so that the answers can emerge.

428
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:19,353
Did you drive?

429
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:29,132
What you say is clear to me,
but it doesn't match...

430
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,872
It is a question of numbers.

431
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:32,164
Or perhaps...

432
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,035
The real problem is that
we get a standard distance,

433
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,950
however it is not correct.

434
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:40,830
Did the journey seem short to you?

435
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,823
You drove.
You can't be objective.

436
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,576
Did the trip seem short
or very long to you?

437
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:52,618
It seemed to me...
rather short.

438
00:30:53,914 --> 00:30:56,335
Quite short...
Have you listened to any music?

439
00:30:57,868 --> 00:30:58,952
No.

440
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:00,674
No.

441
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:06,080
If you had listened to some music,
for example, two albums,

442
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,666
we would have calculated

443
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:10,118
how much music
does an album contain,

444
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,622
and we would have
got the travel time.

445
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:15,590
But we have to leave
from standard elements such as:

446
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:18,683
a kilometer is a lot,
a minute is a lot,

447
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:21,215
a meter is a lot and
a second is a lot.

448
00:31:21,702 --> 00:31:25,751
Right now I'm talking about numbers
and they don't match, sorry.

449
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:31,913
Have you made any stops?

450
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:34,577
Delays, accidents,
toll booths, stops,

451
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:36,821
red traffic lights,
traffic jams?

452
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:38,322
A toll booth.

453
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:40,420
- A toll booth?
- A toll booth, yes.

454
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:43,308
- Only one?
- Yes.

455
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:46,425
- How much did you pay?
- €40.

456
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:47,998
Are you sure?

457
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:49,733
Yes, I'm sure.

458
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:52,721
Do you want to see the receipts?

459
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,660
Yes, if you have them.

460
00:31:57,327 --> 00:32:00,028
Why "receipts"?
A toll booth or more?

461
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:02,493
No, just a toll booth.

462
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,263
Do you have my wallet?

463
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,072
Shit.

464
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,071
- I do not have it.
- Maybe in your pocket?

465
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:29,219
I don't have it,
it is in the car.

466
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,497
- Do you think it was €40?
- Yes.

467
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,160
Sure?

468
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:34,953
Yes, I'm sure.

469
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,881
So you left at 12:15 pm.

470
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:48,051
No, we left around 11:30 am...

471
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:51,868
Yes, 11:15 am... 11:20 am.

472
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,004
It is not possible.

473
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,106
The journey takes approximately
4 hours and 20 minutes.

474
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:11,824
It matches 12:15 pm.

475
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,628
Since it is now 4:35 pm.

476
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:20,326
I can start from the base I want.

477
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,622
But they give us a standard base,
saying "it is this".

478
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,413
My calculations don't add up.

479
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,416
I can start from my base,

480
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,416
according to what seems right to me...
and what seems right to me,

481
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:33,080
in numerical terms,
it is 12:15 pm.

482
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,970
Otherwise, one second...

483
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:38,785
It is not this, it is that...

484
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:41,033
Or that...

485
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,294
We don't have to tell Juliette.

486
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:03,238
She shouldn't
worry about her brother.

487
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,402
We have received your report
to the headquarters.

488
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,014
You sure have done
some of the work.

489
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:18,435
But I think we can
push ourselves a little further.

490
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,266
Have a look.
Her name is...

491
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:24,183
Genevieve Raynaud.

492
00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:27,400
She's not exactly great...

493
00:35:27,484 --> 00:35:30,618
Maybe not, but Mrs. Raynaud...

494
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:34,913
She is indispensable, as we have seen
during Mrs. Evrard's accident.

495
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:37,338
If she's not there,
it won't work.

496
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:40,330
OK. Let's look at it differently.

497
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,455
Tomorrow someone from the first shift
will be run over by a train.

498
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:48,258
- Who can't be?
- Seriously?

499
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:51,288
Nobody.
We need everyone.

500
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:55,452
But, Mr. Lefèvre,
you have to play along.

501
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:59,597
I don't make the rules,
I am an employee, like you.

502
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:03,327
I agree with Olivier,
I think like him.

503
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,434
We did what we could.

504
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:09,521
What could be done
has been done.

505
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:12,618
Mr. Lemesle,
I have no alternative.

506
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:14,981
I have to go back to Paris
with a solution.

507
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,405
It must all be solved,

508
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:19,963
I have to submit a detailed report
to Mrs. Bonnet-Guérin.

509
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:21,608
So I ask you...

510
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:24,633
Tomorrow, someone from the first shift
ends up under a train:

511
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:28,247
who would be indispensable
to the functioning of the department?

512
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:31,076
Mrs. Couton, of course...

513
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,910
Mrs. Couton stays.

514
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:37,222
Ms. Hermine too.

515
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,960
Two people
who should definitely stay.

516
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:46,410
So all the people we have mentioned
so far, are indispensable?

517
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,823
- They are indispensable.
- Absolutely.

518
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:50,958
OK, very good.

519
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:55,493
Therefore...
means we could...

520
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:59,118
do without
Nicole Lemercier, for instance.

521
00:36:59,573 --> 00:37:01,534
If we give up on Lemercier,

522
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:04,743
it will be hell after
the first incoming smallest issue.

523
00:37:04,905 --> 00:37:07,163
Mr. Lefèvre, we have too few.

524
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:09,749
Sorry, but you don't understand.

525
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:12,788
These people come to work
when they are sick.

526
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,285
Even when they are sick.

527
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,708
We need to understand
at what level we are.

528
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,467
We are on red alert.

529
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:21,993
But you didn't come right away
with Mrs. Lemercier.

530
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:25,077
It means she is less efficient.

531
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,952
We wanted to train her for the pumps,
she may be useful there.

532
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:33,400
You will not train a person
over 50 years old!

533
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,583
Impossible,

534
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,913
you don't do training
for those over 50 years old.

535
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,535
I'll put her on the list.

536
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:46,202
If you haven't mentioned her,
it means she is less efficient.

537
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:49,773
So we put her
on the termination list.

538
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:20,497
<i>I was just in time
for his workshop.</i>

539
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:22,202
<i>Look, it's unbelievable.</i>

540
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:24,535
<i>I'm trying to film it, see?</i>

541
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,982
<i>Lucas is so focused.</i>

542
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,160
<i>He is so precise and focused.</i>

543
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:43,244
<i>You have to keep up
with your partner's pace</i>

544
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,119
<i>and listen to each other.</i>

545
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:47,077
<i>Position yourself well.</i>

546
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:50,400
<i>He's so careful.</i>

547
00:38:51,803 --> 00:38:53,798
<i>It's good for him, I think.</i>

548
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:01,289
<i>I love his expression.</i>

549
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,827
<i>See? He seems to be doing better.</i>

550
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,414
<i>You have to pay attention to this:</i>

551
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:14,410
<i>To make him walk
he must stand upright.</i>

552
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,369
<i>He's beautiful, our son.</i>

553
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:21,657
<i>The puppet
is like a musical instrument.</i>

554
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,619
<i>You have to practice,
learn to play it...</i>

555
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:30,535
<i>He's brave.
I'm sure it helps.</i>

556
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,619
<i>He's fine, look...</i>

557
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:53,809
Olivier, It's Philippe.

558
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,105
Am I disturbing you?

559
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,452
Listen...

560
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,471
Go to the Financial Director...

561
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:06,041
and calculate
simulation of total volume...

562
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:11,539
of premiums and bonuses
of all executives within a year.

563
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,147
I mean, for me,

564
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:15,467
the other directors
of the French sites,

565
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:17,604
all Director Assistants

566
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:21,118
and the top managers
of the headquarters.

567
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:24,577
That is, Bonnet-Guérin
and her team.

568
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:33,827
- Hello.
- Hello.

569
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,744
I'm looking for cumin.

570
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:40,585
Hello.

571
00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:53,914
At the clinic they told you
that was okay for tonight?

572
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,383
Yes, they accepted
6 pm instead of 5 pm.

573
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,342
I'll take this one.

574
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:07,350
So...

575
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:11,200
- I'm not sure.
- Try it, use your face.

576
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,549
They all have problems...

577
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,702
- No, look.
- Go on.

578
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:21,821
Your car looks like a wreck.

579
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:24,973
It seems that a part is missing.

580
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:32,024
No, on the contrary.

581
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:34,031
- Does it have extra parts?
- It is very robust.

582
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:35,601
Too many parts.

583
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:39,585
I'll do it again, look.

584
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,175
Does he suffer from road rage?

585
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,708
Is it introverted?

586
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:47,118
It is nervous?

587
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,304
- Small and nervous?
- No.

588
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:52,702
A little... edgy?

589
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:55,951
It is not edgy,
on the contrary.

590
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,744
- Is it severe?
- No.

591
00:41:58,273 --> 00:41:59,730
<i>- Does it only have two doors?
- Yes.</i>

592
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:00,997
- A Beetle?
- No.

593
00:42:01,077 --> 00:42:02,289
The model of...

594
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,139
- Is it French? - No.
- The model of what?

595
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:05,535
- Italian?
- No.

596
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,327
- German, then.
- No.

597
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:09,307
I'll do it again.

598
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:15,623
It's frightening.

599
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,952
- Horrible.
- Look.

600
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:22,226
Is it English?
Ancient?

601
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:25,327
- Is it Italian?
- German?

602
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:27,039
It has a lot...

603
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:30,702
- It has a lot of personality.
- Mom, are you German?

604
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,493
- Is it an Aston Martin?
- I was going to say it!

605
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:35,957
I thought about James Bond.

606
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,452
No, it's more...

607
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:41,929
More like that.

608
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,583
Wait a minute,
you're doing the opposite.

609
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:48,000
- You just did...
- I don't see what I'm doing.

610
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:51,535
It's more... an Aston Martin
would be more like that...

611
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:55,354
Very much so.
This car is more...

612
00:42:56,956 --> 00:42:58,317
I know what it is.

613
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:05,677
I know what it is.

614
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:08,619
- A very expensive car?
- Very expensive.

615
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:10,809
- Is it a Rolls-Royce?
- Not at all.

616
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:12,394
Shit!

617
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,519
Isn't that an Aston Martin?

618
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:21,047
We are on the wrong track,
if it's not English...

619
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:23,768
It is elegant and sporty.

620
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,140
- Isn't that a Ferrari?
- No.

621
00:43:26,224 --> 00:43:27,519
The other one you like.

622
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:29,715
- Not a Porsche?
- But yes!

623
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:32,329
- But it's German, the Porsche!
- I said it.

624
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:36,419
- You've been saying it wasn't.
- I was hoping it wasn't German.

625
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:58,662
If us five plant managers,

626
00:43:58,746 --> 00:44:02,814
our subordinates,
Bonnet-Guérin and her staff in Paris,

627
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:08,001
give up our premiums
and our bonuses for one year only,

628
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:13,031
we can avoid employee layoffs
and our factories are not at risk.

629
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:15,143
What is it
that doesn't convince you?

630
00:44:15,227 --> 00:44:17,307
I don't see it that way.

631
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:19,480
I can cut the staff.

632
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,916
There will be arms wrestling
with the trade unions, but so be it.

633
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:24,772
We've seen that before.
What do we care?

634
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:26,556
Jean-Pierre, that's not the point.

635
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,997
I think if us, five directors,

636
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:32,147
we go in front of Bonnet-Guérin
with my solution,

637
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:36,522
which is super solid, well argued,
greatly structured,

638
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:39,192
then I think
we have a strong case.

639
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,874
- I'm not sure.
- Yes. A strong case.

640
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:46,144
She will have to listen to us
and report to the Americans and Cooper.

641
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:47,560
This is how I see it.

642
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,526
If you don't have the balls
to cut the branches,

643
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:52,974
It's your problem, not mine.

644
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:54,947
We have the balls,

645
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,055
and we ask you to have the balls
to come with us

646
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:00,855
to say Bonnet-Guérin
what we must do differently.

647
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:02,208
For me,

648
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,947
meeting such a difficult
requirement is a way to

649
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:09,234
get out of my comfort zone
and make progress.

650
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:12,022
I think we have different goals.

651
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:13,814
This will weaken our factories.

652
00:45:13,983 --> 00:45:17,981
Inevitably, one will end up giving in,
we don't know which...

653
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,731
and the other four will have to
recover production.

654
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:24,094
Maybe some of you -
do you really want this?

655
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:27,647
- Insult us, while you're at it.
- I'm not insulting anyone.

656
00:45:27,727 --> 00:45:29,958
Mine is an engineer reflex,

657
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:34,011
I try to understand...
the logic of your position.

658
00:45:34,091 --> 00:45:37,481
You insult us and, as an engineer,
can you give us management lessons?

659
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:39,822
He's not insulting you
and not giving lessons.

660
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,583
- That's all he does.
- No,

661
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:43,686
he neither insults you,
nor gives you lessons.

662
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:46,731
But it is our duty,
as plant managers,

663
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:50,339
to notify the general management
of the dangers of restructuring.

664
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:52,643
I will be even more direct
than Jean-Pierre.

665
00:45:52,727 --> 00:45:55,887
None of us
steals salary and bonuses,

666
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:57,164
we deserve them.

667
00:45:57,248 --> 00:46:00,865
Anyway, I will not give to the company
my bonuses and rewards.

668
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:04,314
Christophe, join us,
I'm running out of arguments.

669
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,019
Help me, explain it to him.

670
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:08,769
It is true that
I have not said anything so far,

671
00:46:09,823 --> 00:46:12,112
but I'm not sure anymore

672
00:46:12,196 --> 00:46:16,186
that it is necessary to fight against
the management's economic plan.

673
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,916
You, Christophe?

674
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:22,550
Who put Bonnet-Guérin in her place
and he talked to her...

675
00:46:22,634 --> 00:46:26,356
You remember what you said, right?

676
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:29,564
Who explained to her that
all this makes no sense...

677
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:32,032
Are you saying that
you changed your mind today?

678
00:46:32,116 --> 00:46:35,791
- Yes, and I have the right.
- It is not a question of law.

679
00:46:35,874 --> 00:46:38,541
- The situation has not changed.
- Mine does.

680
00:46:38,624 --> 00:46:43,412
The management made it clear that
if I'm too cocky, I lose my job.

681
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:45,981
How much do I have left?
Four more years until I retire?

682
00:46:46,192 --> 00:46:48,436
I've been
breaking my ass for years.

683
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:51,606
I will not go without
what they owe me, I deserved it.

684
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:53,981
You are telling me
you're okay with retirement

685
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:57,242
leaving behind
a weakened company?

686
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:59,146
- Is that so?
- Wait...

687
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,254
You all realize that
we are at a dead end?

688
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:07,142
Philippe and I alone
will never convince the Group.

689
00:47:07,226 --> 00:47:08,602
It's every man for himself.

690
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:12,018
- Every man for himself?
- It's not that simple...

691
00:47:12,102 --> 00:47:13,815
Yes, it is everyone for himself.

692
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:17,069
- Philippe, stop fooling yourself.
- I'm not.

693
00:47:17,153 --> 00:47:18,784
Yes, you do
because it is possible that

694
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:21,981
the Group wants
that we run into a wall.

695
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:26,007
Then it's easier
to close factories in France

696
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:29,488
and relocate them
to low-wage countries.

697
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:33,481
- And Cooper can get even richer.
- It's exactly the other way around.

698
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:39,144
Cooper wants to cut costs
without endangering its companies.

699
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:42,122
What I am
desperately trying to tell you.

700
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:47,549
Okay, but not with my money,
or his, or his!

701
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:16,522
Can I sit down?

702
00:50:17,477 --> 00:50:19,677
We came for a chat.

703
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:21,161
Your father came to me

704
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:24,743
with the list of textbooks
you asked him.

705
00:50:24,827 --> 00:50:27,190
He didn't know if
he should buy them or not,

706
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:28,731
he asked for advice.

707
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,954
I suggested
to talk to you about it.

708
00:50:31,038 --> 00:50:32,227
What do you think?

709
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:36,348
No, but it's normal
to ask you for advice.

710
00:50:36,432 --> 00:50:39,169
But I absolutely
need those books...

711
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:43,147
to catch up and
prepare for the year-end exam.

712
00:50:43,397 --> 00:50:45,290
Do you think you are left behind?

713
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:49,275
I got a little behind,
but it is normal.

714
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:51,833
But I have to catch up.

715
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:54,376
If I could have my books,
it would be useful to me.

716
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,061
Does it seem difficult to you
to catch up for these 15 days?

717
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:02,493
In any case,
I really can't risk it

718
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:06,079
to waste more time, not anymore.

719
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:09,622
I'm already
not very proud of what I did,

720
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:11,189
I would like to get back to work.

721
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:13,852
You don't have to be
ashamed, you know?

722
00:51:13,977 --> 00:51:16,269
It happens to a lot of people.

723
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:19,519
But what exactly
are you ashamed of?

724
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:23,061
You don't do these things
in front of others,

725
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,518
and I know that...

726
00:51:24,602 --> 00:51:27,939
that my classmates
attack me on social media.

727
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,727
It doesn't matter, I understand...

728
00:51:30,945 --> 00:51:33,500
but I have to catch up on time

729
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:35,391
that I have spent here.

730
00:51:35,577 --> 00:51:38,881
Do you really
need those books now...

731
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:41,019
to prepare for your exam?

732
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:45,897
Well, the sooner I get them, the sooner
I can start to prepare for the exam.

733
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,400
For example, on the list...

734
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:49,686
You got it?

735
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:52,436
Your father gave it to me.

736
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,903
I wrote down
the most important ones,

737
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,555
But...

738
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,653
about these they will
question us for sure.

739
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:02,385
<i>Jean-Marie Peretti,
Human resources, 2017.</i>

740
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:04,837
Sure, you have to know it by heart.

741
00:52:05,144 --> 00:52:07,439
<i>The evolution of Toyotism since '93.</i>

742
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:08,687
A lot...

743
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,050
You don't think you should rest
a little longer, catch your breath?

744
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,552
I'm rested and it's quiet here.

745
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:17,311
I feel much better.

746
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:19,728
That is amazing.

747
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:24,103
And then, what
really motivates me...

748
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,417
That...

749
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:30,773
I was lucky because my time here
coincided with the holiday,

750
00:52:30,853 --> 00:52:33,311
so I didn't miss much.

751
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:35,835
In that sense, I was very lucky.

752
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:39,405
What do you think about
what is Lucas is saying?

753
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,811
Well...

754
00:52:41,197 --> 00:52:44,811
I'm glad he's feeling better.

755
00:52:45,252 --> 00:52:48,749
Maybe it's worth a try.

756
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,863
He has worked hard in recent years,

757
00:52:52,947 --> 00:52:55,023
it would be foolish
to penalize him,

758
00:52:55,176 --> 00:52:56,659
and it is also for his future.

759
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,500
That's right,

760
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:03,722
the job that I have done in recent years
it takes shape now,

761
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,439
in the year-end exam.

762
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,505
- I understand, it's a lot of work.
- Yes, that's a bit of a shame...

763
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:11,389
But do you see yourself
going back home?

764
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:14,356
- Resuming the Business School...
- I'm better.

765
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,568
...resuming the courses,
do you feel like it?

766
00:53:16,737 --> 00:53:18,608
- Of course.
- Doesn't that scare you?

767
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:20,599
No, I'm not afraid.

768
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:24,644
Here I took a break and
it did me a lot of good.

769
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:26,439
I am super motivated.

770
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:29,955
Especially since,
if I pass the exam,

771
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,458
I will have a job at Facebook.

772
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,810
So that's really cool.

773
00:53:33,894 --> 00:53:36,644
It motivates me even more
to commit myself.

774
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:39,738
Do you already know that you will
be hired by Facebook? - Yes.

775
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:42,995
- Since when?
- If I pass the exam.

776
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,668
I posted my resume on Facebook,
and Mark Zuckerberg answered me.

777
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:50,552
He said he's interested.

778
00:53:50,892 --> 00:53:53,624
So great.
I just have to pass the exam.

779
00:53:53,707 --> 00:53:55,731
It will be a formality,
if I have the books.

780
00:53:55,811 --> 00:53:57,731
And then things
will run their course.

781
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,648
Did you talk to him on the phone?

782
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:03,561
First on Messenger,
then he gave me his number.

783
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:05,950
So I could
explain things clearly to him.

784
00:54:06,645 --> 00:54:07,759
All right... wow...

785
00:54:08,307 --> 00:54:09,377
When did it happen?

786
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:11,464
Recently.

787
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:13,727
While you were here?

788
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:16,434
Did everything fall into place?
The phone call, the resume?

789
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:21,019
How did you understand
that he would hire you after the exam?

790
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,935
Because I felt his enthusiasm,

791
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:29,019
from how he listened to me,
and the ideas I proposed for Facebook.

792
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:33,684
I felt he was excited,
so I took advantage of it,

793
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:38,019
and in the end he made an offer to me
if I pass the exam.

794
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,810
An important position.

795
00:54:39,894 --> 00:54:44,604
So I need those books fast
to prepare for the exam.

796
00:55:58,436 --> 00:56:02,644
I have read
your alternative proposal,

797
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:04,666
and I'll tell you right away,

798
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:09,256
I am both dissatisfied and disappointed
in the way you handled it.

799
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:13,202
I have personally
vouched to Mr. Cooper

800
00:56:13,468 --> 00:56:17,118
that you would deliver
your conclusions on time.

801
00:56:17,202 --> 00:56:18,625
I'm late now.

802
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,915
I ask you for the conclusions
and the lists as soon as possible.

803
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:25,011
The other European sites
did it without any problems.

804
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:27,073
- Not true.
- We know that's not true.

805
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:31,636
In Germany and Italy, some
directors are in the same situation.

806
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,894
We know
everything went very well.

807
00:56:33,978 --> 00:56:36,646
The plant managers
talk to each other.

808
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,892
We share information.

809
00:56:38,976 --> 00:56:42,273
Denis, I only see an opportunity
for Americans to say

810
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:44,384
that the French
do not face challenges.

811
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,188
Claire, why don't you

812
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:49,824
consider our proposal
as an opportunity for the Group?

813
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:50,928
Meaning?

814
00:56:51,072 --> 00:56:56,471
Instead of seeing it as an obstacle,
why not interpret it as a signal?

815
00:56:56,555 --> 00:57:00,421
A strong signal for everyone.

816
00:57:00,505 --> 00:57:03,916
And a way to demonstrate
to our collaborators

817
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,439
that all the executives of Elsonn
share the risks.

818
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:12,631
At the same time,
that the Group defends values

819
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:15,483
that Mr. Cooper emphasizes so much
in all his speeches.

820
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:19,200
"Fairness and generosity".
Let's talk about this.

821
00:57:19,284 --> 00:57:21,202
- Is there a business strategy?
- Yes.

822
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:23,560
- Do you know it by heart?
- Yes.

823
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:24,718
Let's stick to that.

824
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,453
We stick to it
if the strategy is beneficial.

825
00:57:28,537 --> 00:57:29,721
But at any cost?

826
00:57:29,805 --> 00:57:35,928
A strategy that throws our results and
our collaborators in uncertainty:

827
00:57:36,012 --> 00:57:37,143
do we stick to it anyway?

828
00:57:37,227 --> 00:57:38,870
Is this the policy?

829
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:40,478
Everything is uncertain.

830
00:57:40,629 --> 00:57:43,775
Life, health, love, work.

831
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:45,291
So, it will be clear,

832
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:48,413
I'm not going
to hand this over to Mr. Cooper.

833
00:57:48,593 --> 00:57:51,353
Because,
if you continue on this road,

834
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,327
you will give a deplorable image
to the American board.

835
00:57:54,411 --> 00:57:57,466
He is right,
you are an exceptional manager.

836
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,227
I'm not flattering you,
we all know.

837
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,523
You were extraordinary
two years ago,

838
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:05,648
and I was the first
to give you praise

839
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,356
for the work done
with the layoff plan.

840
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,175
Now what's gotten into you,
from one day to another?

841
00:58:11,258 --> 00:58:12,681
They will not understand.

842
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:17,023
We are here to make proposals -
concrete, alternative,

843
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:18,689
to defend an idea.

844
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:22,095
It is wonderful
to defend one's ideas,

845
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:24,862
but do you realize
the consequences?

846
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:28,053
You can lose your job
that you are putting into play.

847
00:58:28,228 --> 00:58:30,448
It is a steep price for an idea.

848
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:33,978
Let's talk about
defending our work.

849
00:58:34,103 --> 00:58:37,061
- This is what we're talking about.
- You're doing it very badly.

850
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:40,949
If you don't, others
will do it in your place.

851
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:42,333
No questions asked.

852
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,212
You have a special relationship
with the trade unions,

853
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:47,539
you can make them swallow anything.

854
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:51,020
Do not risk for other negotiators
to face them.

855
00:58:51,104 --> 00:58:52,853
You are extraordinary,

856
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:56,064
respected by your teams,
because you respect them.

857
00:58:56,144 --> 00:58:57,583
Take advantage of this

858
00:58:57,666 --> 00:59:01,872
to present conclusions acceptable
to Mr. Cooper and his team,

859
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:04,185
and less painful
for those that will leave,

860
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:06,008
and also
for those who will stay.

861
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:07,512
Focus on this.

862
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:10,342
That's what the company wants
from you now.

863
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:12,269
I need you now.

864
00:59:14,419 --> 00:59:16,711
I'm sorry to tell you that...

865
00:59:17,228 --> 00:59:18,242
No.

866
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,434
We will not be able
to fulfill this request.

867
00:59:20,782 --> 00:59:24,481
If you do not satisfy the request,
you take your responsibilities.

868
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,356
We are not here
to obstruct, Claire.

869
00:59:27,436 --> 00:59:30,295
We are here to defend the company
in the long term.

870
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:31,832
I'm not deaf, Philippe.

871
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,720
And you, do you listen to me?

872
00:59:33,926 --> 00:59:37,843
I will not present this
to Mr. Cooper and his staff.

873
00:59:38,728 --> 00:59:42,333
I personally
vouched to Mr. Cooper

874
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:45,106
that all French sites
will respond in the same way.

875
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:46,230
Agree.

876
00:59:46,395 --> 00:59:50,538
It means that if Denis and I
do not fulfill the request,

877
00:59:50,622 --> 00:59:52,610
we risk our jobs.

878
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:55,750
And Mr. Cooper
will see this refusal

879
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:58,381
as a consequence
of your failed policies.

880
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,496
Of course.

881
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,856
- You're going too far.
- Why?

882
01:00:00,936 --> 01:00:03,481
You can't get the benefits
without the drawbacks.

883
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:07,148
Mr. Baumont, please.
No advantages without drawbacks.

884
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:11,686
You are at the head of the
Elsonn France group, right?

885
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:13,644
So, if we...

886
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,186
poor little directors
of a regional plant,

887
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:22,024
we don't do our homework,
because you can't make us do it.

888
01:00:22,108 --> 01:00:23,940
This is what Mr. Cooper will think.

889
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,313
The great director of Elsonn France
declares this meeting closed.

890
01:00:27,397 --> 01:00:30,065
- It's not over.
- We stop here.

891
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:32,823
Mr. Lemesle,
it's been five minutes since...

892
01:00:32,903 --> 01:00:36,098
- It's not over.
- At this point, we have nothing to lose.

893
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,106
I didn't think I'd come to this.

894
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:42,102
Claire, I tell you clearly,
Pulcinella's little secret:

895
01:00:42,326 --> 01:00:47,021
that Mr. Cooper wants to appoint you
as the head of European zone, right?

896
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:49,980
- And what do you want to say?
- Everybody knows.

897
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:51,937
Everyone knows it, Claire.

898
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:54,936
So I have a question:

899
01:00:55,154 --> 01:00:58,238
Are you prepared
to disappoint Mr. Cooper?

900
01:00:58,337 --> 01:01:01,645
telling him that two directors
of the establishment,

901
01:01:01,856 --> 01:01:05,065
Denis and I,
will not respond to the request?

902
01:01:05,212 --> 01:01:07,173
Are you ready to take the risk?

903
01:01:07,257 --> 01:01:11,306
He will see it as
a management failure.

904
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:12,790
Are you aware of it?

905
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:15,427
I ask if you are ready
to take this risk.

906
01:01:17,948 --> 01:01:19,024
Answer me.

907
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:21,796
If you can't answer me,

908
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,685
present this proposal
to Mr. Cooper and his staff.

909
01:01:25,768 --> 01:01:27,031
We ask no more.

910
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,235
Good morning.

911
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:33,862
Take a seat.

912
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:43,671
We wanted to see you
because we would like to know

913
01:01:43,755 --> 01:01:48,767
if the rumors circulating
in the company are founded.

914
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:53,532
Elsonn is rumored
to be preparing a layoff plan

915
01:01:53,616 --> 01:01:56,393
that would concern
10% of the workforce.

916
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:58,162
Who said that?

917
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:01,830
It doesn't matter who said it.

918
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,809
We want to know
if it's true or not.

919
01:02:03,893 --> 01:02:05,645
Madam...

920
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,289
Mrs. Laurent,
you ask me for a meeting in my office,

921
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:12,471
so I want to know who
is spreading those rumors.

922
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:15,330
We are not here for that.

923
01:02:15,728 --> 01:02:18,669
But because of these rumors,

924
01:02:18,753 --> 01:02:21,411
some of us
are worried and also angry.

925
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:26,020
It's not my job to
make rumors, to confirm or deny.

926
01:02:26,211 --> 01:02:28,908
What does it mean?
That the rumors are well founded?

927
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:32,601
- Are they partly true?
- I did not say this.

928
01:02:32,686 --> 01:02:35,657
And, if I had an announcement to make,
I wouldn't do it in this office,

929
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,023
you see?

930
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:40,900
There are legal procedures,
you know the rules.

931
01:02:40,984 --> 01:02:45,084
Okay, there are procedures,
but the workers are worried.

932
01:02:45,168 --> 01:02:48,856
If there's really nothing going on,
you can tell us. Simple.

933
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,815
I cannot.

934
01:02:50,973 --> 01:02:52,577
- Yes you can.
- No.

935
01:02:52,661 --> 01:02:56,198
Legally
there is nothing that forbids it.

936
01:02:57,159 --> 01:02:59,466
I want to know who
is spreading those rumors.

937
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:03,648
Disrupting a team is easy.
I can do that too.

938
01:03:03,728 --> 01:03:07,190
If no layoffs are planned,
tell us it's not true,

939
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:08,981
Then we leave. End of story.

940
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:11,456
Then we can reassure people, okay?

941
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,811
And we end it here.

942
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:17,765
- If that pleases you, fine.
- It's not to please us.

943
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:20,304
That's not what
we're here for, okay?

944
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,906
We will not give you names.

945
01:03:23,544 --> 01:03:29,638
You must understand that
people in your factory are worried.

946
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:31,815
People talk...

947
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:34,024
Maybe, instead,
it would be better to keep quiet.

948
01:03:34,108 --> 01:03:35,608
Sir, it's simple:

949
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:41,186
Tell us
there is no layoff plan in place

950
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,728
and we leave.

951
01:03:42,812 --> 01:03:44,581
- I'm telling you.
- Excuse me?

952
01:03:44,939 --> 01:03:46,018
I am telling you.

953
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:49,667
Do you guarantee us that Elsonn
has no layoffs plan right now?

954
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:53,400
Is this it?

955
01:03:55,704 --> 01:03:57,538
- Exactly, yes.
- Okay.

956
01:03:57,622 --> 01:03:59,788
So you declare officially

957
01:03:59,872 --> 01:04:02,638
that Elsonn doesn't have
a plan of dismissal right now?

958
01:04:04,645 --> 01:04:07,453
And we can share it
with colleagues, right?

959
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:09,028
Exactly.

960
01:04:18,728 --> 01:04:20,195
Thank you.

961
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,310
Denis, can you answer?

962
01:08:43,084 --> 01:08:45,964
You know very well that
the factory cannot function

963
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:47,710
with fewer people.

964
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,433
- Yes it can.
- No.

965
01:08:51,672 --> 01:08:54,126
It will collapse, Mr. Lemesle.

966
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,838
It will collapse and you know it.

967
01:08:55,922 --> 01:08:57,214
It will hold up.

968
01:08:57,514 --> 01:08:59,153
It will collapse, I tell you.

969
01:08:59,237 --> 01:09:02,519
Do you think that I want
to ruin everyone?

970
01:09:02,783 --> 01:09:04,872
- It's not collapsing, I tell you.
- Sir, excuse me.

971
01:09:04,956 --> 01:09:08,453
I have a simple question.

972
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:12,607
What is the purpose of the Americans
with this layoff plan?

973
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:15,107
Squeeze ourselves more and more,
more and more?

974
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:18,095
Squeeze us until
the company collapses?

975
01:09:18,428 --> 01:09:20,978
And after that, what will we do?

976
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:22,666
Let me finish.

977
01:09:22,749 --> 01:09:25,037
All our skills will go abroad?

978
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,017
Letizia, you're imagining things.
There's no conspiracy behind it.

979
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,023
I don't imagine anything.

980
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:34,716
We will reorganize and
we will find solutions.

981
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,812
What solutions?

982
01:09:36,022 --> 01:09:37,991
Let me tell you something:

983
01:09:38,075 --> 01:09:41,353
A few years ago
you would've never allowed it.

984
01:09:41,437 --> 01:09:43,754
- Not true.
- It is so.

985
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:45,707
- A moment...
- Never...

986
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:47,346
You don't care.

987
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,312
At the end of the year
you fill your pockets.

988
01:09:49,747 --> 01:09:51,358
Don't talk to me like that.

989
01:09:51,442 --> 01:09:52,960
I talk how I want.

990
01:09:53,044 --> 01:09:55,375
For the last seven years

991
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:58,646
you have been cutting back,
making us overworked.

992
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:01,133
We are tired,
and you fill your pockets.

993
01:10:01,217 --> 01:10:05,895
Don't go down the road
of offense or insinuation!

994
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,728
Who is insulting who?

995
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:09,732
No, you're going too far.

996
01:10:11,265 --> 01:10:13,148
Mr. Lemesle didn't insult you.

997
01:10:13,228 --> 01:10:17,273
If there is always quality dialogue
in this company, it's thanks to him.

998
01:10:17,353 --> 01:10:18,607
We are getting nowhere.

999
01:10:18,687 --> 01:10:20,853
I would like to get to one point.

1000
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,666
I would like
to come back to one thing.

1001
01:10:22,982 --> 01:10:24,161
Your word.

1002
01:10:24,758 --> 01:10:26,046
We were in your office,

1003
01:10:26,632 --> 01:10:30,122
you looked at us and said:
"No layoff plan".

1004
01:10:31,406 --> 01:10:32,617
Is it true or not?

1005
01:10:36,002 --> 01:10:41,015
I told you it was not the right place
to make an announcement.

1006
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:42,805
That's not what he said.

1007
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:47,145
If you want me to invent things
to please you...

1008
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,665
Mr. Lemesle couldn't
have told you more.

1009
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:53,600
He knows perfectly well
what he said.

1010
01:10:53,684 --> 01:10:56,565
- He couldn't have told you more.
- Of course he did!

1011
01:10:56,774 --> 01:10:59,027
I ask you again:
Yes or no?

1012
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:00,716
Yes or no?
Yes or no?

1013
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,538
Did you tell us
there wasn't a layoff plan?

1014
01:11:02,622 --> 01:11:03,648
Yes or no?

1015
01:11:03,853 --> 01:11:08,523
I told you it was not the right place
to announce a layoff plan.

1016
01:11:08,813 --> 01:11:10,963
By the way, since you were there,

1017
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:13,718
remember
that I have evoked the law.

1018
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:16,859
- That's not true.
- You are lying, sir.

1019
01:11:16,978 --> 01:11:19,857
You mentioned the law and
that it was not the right place,

1020
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:22,142
but in the end
you made us a promise.

1021
01:11:22,226 --> 01:11:24,504
That nothing was expected,
you said it.

1022
01:11:24,588 --> 01:11:26,273
You may have not
understood correctly.

1023
01:11:26,353 --> 01:11:28,312
We did not understand?

1024
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,770
Do you think
we have not understood?

1025
01:11:32,076 --> 01:11:33,858
And you too?

1026
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:36,454
Did I misunderstand?
And Cedric too?

1027
01:11:37,116 --> 01:11:38,300
Did Jean get it wrong?

1028
01:11:39,448 --> 01:11:42,226
Are you sure you want
to go down this road?

1029
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:44,789
You can look me in the eye
and tell me that I misunderstood?

1030
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:47,657
Are you sure
you want to play this game?

1031
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,020
Then I'll tell you one thing:

1032
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,624
that conversation...

1033
01:11:54,748 --> 01:11:56,519
we recorded it.

1034
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,468
This is outrageous!

1035
01:11:58,885 --> 01:12:02,187
You talk to us about trust
since we've been here

1036
01:12:02,478 --> 01:12:04,052
and then secretly record?

1037
01:12:04,136 --> 01:12:05,765
That's not trust!

1038
01:12:05,849 --> 01:12:09,232
- We fight with what we have.
- We protect ourselves.

1039
01:12:09,312 --> 01:12:10,923
How can we have confidence?

1040
01:12:11,003 --> 01:12:14,107
I propose that
we listen to Cedric's cell phone.

1041
01:12:14,187 --> 01:12:15,940
What do you say, Mr. Lemesle?

1042
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:17,988
What do you think?

1043
01:12:18,562 --> 01:12:22,853
<i>...Tell us there is
no layoff plan in place</i>

1044
01:12:22,978 --> 01:12:25,103
<i>and we leave.</i>

1045
01:12:25,397 --> 01:12:26,398
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1046
01:12:26,478 --> 01:12:27,687
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

1047
01:12:27,853 --> 01:12:29,738
<i>Do you guarantee us</i>

1048
01:12:29,822 --> 01:12:33,625
<i>that Elsonn
has no layoff plan right now?</i>

1049
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:34,822
<i>Is this it?</i>

1050
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:38,018
<i>Exactly, yes.</i>

1051
01:12:38,102 --> 01:12:39,198
<i>Okay.</i>

1052
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:41,346
<i>So you declare officially</i>

1053
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:45,602
<i>that Elsonn doesn't have
a plan of dismissal right now?</i>

1054
01:13:35,784 --> 01:13:39,604
Beautiful space
and yet it feels cozy.

1055
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:41,135
True.

1056
01:13:44,547 --> 01:13:46,422
And the heating?

1057
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,687
- Floor heating.
- Okay.

1058
01:13:50,312 --> 01:13:54,762
There is a heat pump outside,
connected to the boiler,

1059
01:13:54,846 --> 01:13:56,312
which heats very well.

1060
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,340
Even these large spaces?

1061
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,628
No, the heat rises

1062
01:14:02,712 --> 01:14:06,671
and no need for other heat sources
for the mezzanine.

1063
01:14:07,562 --> 01:14:09,482
- No need.
- Just the boiler is enough...

1064
01:14:09,599 --> 01:14:10,902
Yes, absolutely.

1065
01:14:11,152 --> 01:14:13,861
- Just in case, there's a fireplace.
- Exactly.

1066
01:14:14,628 --> 01:14:17,253
We didn't expect it.

1067
01:14:18,395 --> 01:14:19,604
Indeed.

1068
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,749
I love this space.

1069
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:31,354
Very cozy.

1070
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:35,440
The house has many nooks.
You can be alone and still be together.

1071
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,662
Exactly.

1072
01:14:36,745 --> 01:14:39,479
One can work upstairs,
the other rests below.

1073
01:14:40,337 --> 01:14:42,920
Ideal for a family.

1074
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:45,520
The living spaces

1075
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:50,021
run into each other.
They are shared.

1076
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:52,870
It's exactly
what we're looking for.

1077
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:54,979
And the bedrooms are isolated...

1078
01:14:55,526 --> 01:14:57,736
You can still have privacy.

1079
01:14:57,895 --> 01:14:59,279
Absolutely.

1080
01:15:00,605 --> 01:15:03,105
It would be nice
to show it to Jeanne.

1081
01:15:04,436 --> 01:15:06,561
I'm sure she would like it.

1082
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:08,598
Could we see it again?

1083
01:15:08,682 --> 01:15:09,926
Of course.

1084
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:13,229
Our little girl would be thrilled

1085
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,544
to give her opinion.

1086
01:15:16,844 --> 01:15:19,348
It will not be difficult
to convince her.

1087
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,229
- Do you have a daughter?
- Yes.

1088
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:23,287
A four-year-old girl.

1089
01:15:40,812 --> 01:15:42,145
What do you think?

1090
01:15:42,854 --> 01:15:44,195
I love it.

1091
01:15:44,312 --> 01:15:45,520
Exceptional.

1092
01:15:45,645 --> 01:15:47,104
Love at first sight.

1093
01:16:36,446 --> 01:16:38,113
We made some things nicer.

1094
01:16:38,197 --> 01:16:39,749
That can be fun too.

1095
01:16:39,854 --> 01:16:41,145
Of course.

1096
01:16:41,354 --> 01:16:43,187
And the light?

1097
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:44,366
On the South.

1098
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,013
Directly on the South.

1099
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:49,645
In summer it must be...

1100
01:16:50,007 --> 01:16:52,757
magical, full of light.

1101
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:02,332
Are you staying in the region?

1102
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:04,585
No, we're moving.

1103
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:33,124
"With your irresponsibility
and lack of leadership,

1104
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:35,850
you have violated the French laws,

1105
01:17:35,934 --> 01:17:39,815
deliberately lying
to the union representatives,

1106
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:41,895
stating, in your office,

1107
01:17:42,089 --> 01:17:45,582
that the Elsonn Group
did not consider a layoff plan.

1108
01:17:46,831 --> 01:17:48,946
Furthermore,

1109
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:51,843
the recorded conversation
was obtained by the media,

1110
01:17:51,927 --> 01:17:54,899
while not preventing its implementation,
it has hindered

1111
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:58,390
the peaceful application
of the Group's economic plan,

1112
01:17:58,474 --> 01:18:01,940
and has seriously compromised
the image of the company,

1113
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,857
its deep ethical commitment
and respect

1114
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:08,102
that is the basis of well-being
of employees and the brand.

1115
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:09,589
Furthermore,

1116
01:18:09,826 --> 01:18:13,811
the well-known friendship
with your Director of Operations,

1117
01:18:14,007 --> 01:18:15,951
Olivier Lefèvre,

1118
01:18:16,284 --> 01:18:18,764
undermined
your managerial authority,

1119
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:22,524
preventing you from realizing
the vision of the Elsonn Group.

1120
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:25,899
This lack of dedication
to the values of Elsonn

1121
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:29,274
prevented you from developing
a constructive dialogue

1122
01:18:29,462 --> 01:18:32,120
with staff representatives,

1123
01:18:32,204 --> 01:18:34,608
in order to carry out
the restructuring

1124
01:18:34,692 --> 01:18:37,029
necessary for
the survival of the company.

1125
01:18:37,678 --> 01:18:40,520
Noting the extreme
gravity of the facts,

1126
01:18:41,026 --> 01:18:44,318
the Elsonn Group
proceeds to your dismissal

1127
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:46,042
for serious misconduct

1128
01:18:46,646 --> 01:18:49,853
to the effect
of immediate departure

1129
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:52,625
and without severance pay."

1130
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,017
Do you want to say something?

1131
01:18:58,519 --> 01:19:00,804
I would like to say just one thing:

1132
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:05,645
I expected more loyalty
from the Elsonn Group.

1133
01:19:05,918 --> 01:19:07,284
I understand.

1134
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:11,652
But perhaps Elsonn
expected more loyalty from you.

1135
01:19:11,736 --> 01:19:12,958
But I was loyal.

1136
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:15,378
I've done my job.

1137
01:19:18,415 --> 01:19:22,685
I have the feeling that
you didn't get the full support.

1138
01:19:23,788 --> 01:19:25,661
What do you mean?

1139
01:19:25,745 --> 01:19:27,970
I'm asking you a question.

1140
01:19:28,883 --> 01:19:30,633
Don't you think...

1141
01:19:31,151 --> 01:19:32,204
Perhaps...

1142
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:35,239
I'm not saying
that you did everything right.

1143
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,458
But...

1144
01:19:36,658 --> 01:19:38,366
we could say, maybe...

1145
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,315
maybe you will agree,

1146
01:19:40,728 --> 01:19:43,136
that the one who has hindered

1147
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:48,303
the peaceful execution
of the restructuring plan the most...

1148
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:52,258
Let Lefèvre be your Director
of Operations? Olivier Lefèvre?

1149
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,284
Why...

1150
01:19:55,349 --> 01:19:58,474
What is the task
of a Director of Operations?

1151
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,226
Support and accompany
the plant manager.

1152
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:04,568
- Do you agree?
- Yes.

1153
01:20:04,652 --> 01:20:06,193
Not to put a stick in the wheel.

1154
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:09,451
Lefèvre did nothing else.

1155
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:16,664
Do you think I'm not aware?

1156
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,672
Do you really think
that no one tells me anything?

1157
01:20:20,807 --> 01:20:23,258
It is true that
because of my position,

1158
01:20:23,342 --> 01:20:26,403
I spend my time
at the headquarters in Paris.

1159
01:20:27,229 --> 01:20:29,521
But I get it all.
I know it all.

1160
01:20:31,315 --> 01:20:34,616
I know what happens,
practically in real time,

1161
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,158
at each site of the Group.

1162
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:41,353
Mr. Baumont,
tell him what you told me

1163
01:20:41,635 --> 01:20:45,812
after you spent the day
on the site of Mr. Lemesle.

1164
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:50,548
Of that visit,
I remember very well

1165
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:55,092
that Lefèvre was extremely negative
about the economic plan

1166
01:20:55,176 --> 01:20:57,926
wanted by the Group.

1167
01:20:58,273 --> 01:21:01,171
Do you remember that...

1168
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:04,925
we wrote names on the list?

1169
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:09,146
We can say that Mr. Lefèvre

1170
01:21:09,437 --> 01:21:11,132
put up a lot of resistance.

1171
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:13,911
He was against everything.

1172
01:21:15,802 --> 01:21:19,520
We could even say
that he completely refused

1173
01:21:19,724 --> 01:21:21,525
to collaborate on the project.

1174
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:25,242
When we have...

1175
01:21:25,392 --> 01:21:26,770
Philippe, look at me.

1176
01:21:26,854 --> 01:21:29,840
When we have
a role of responsibility,

1177
01:21:31,063 --> 01:21:32,688
like Lefèvre's,

1178
01:21:32,975 --> 01:21:35,392
shouldn't we
put the public interest

1179
01:21:35,476 --> 01:21:37,818
before our personal scruples?

1180
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:40,635
Yes.

1181
01:21:41,842 --> 01:21:43,003
I think that...

1182
01:21:44,468 --> 01:21:45,930
your friend Olivier Lefèvre,

1183
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:49,853
took you too far for too long

1184
01:21:50,134 --> 01:21:51,691
on the ground of feelings.

1185
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:55,577
That's also what we like about you.
Your value.

1186
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:58,478
Your great humanity.
Everyone recognizes it.

1187
01:21:58,562 --> 01:22:01,812
But the fact is that
at the end of the day

1188
01:22:02,755 --> 01:22:04,374
you are the only one who pays.

1189
01:22:05,715 --> 01:22:08,062
I find it very unfair.

1190
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,463
I think Mr. Lefèvre

1191
01:22:14,507 --> 01:22:16,400
is totally responsible

1192
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:18,968
for this fiasco.

1193
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:22,965
I'll go a little further.

1194
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:26,252
In my opinion,

1195
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:30,045
Elsonn would have all the interest

1196
01:22:31,563 --> 01:22:34,823
to get rid of someone like Lefèvre.

1197
01:22:37,547 --> 01:22:39,620
For several reasons.
I'll mention only two.

1198
01:22:39,971 --> 01:22:43,887
First, what I believe
is the most important one -

1199
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:47,294
the well-being of employees.

1200
01:22:48,683 --> 01:22:53,706
When an element like him,
with his level of responsibility,

1201
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:57,520
prevents a smooth course
of industrial policy,

1202
01:22:57,701 --> 01:22:59,378
he just creates a mess.

1203
01:22:59,462 --> 01:23:00,951
That happens constantly.

1204
01:23:01,537 --> 01:23:05,167
And I think he was very sneaky.

1205
01:23:05,702 --> 01:23:07,535
I'm going one step further.

1206
01:23:08,342 --> 01:23:11,061
I think that
he had an idea for a while.

1207
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:14,695
Because right now,
the position that is vacant, Philippe,

1208
01:23:15,215 --> 01:23:16,304
it's yours.

1209
01:23:18,937 --> 01:23:20,614
I don't think it's fair

1210
01:23:20,937 --> 01:23:25,104
that it's you who has to
carry the cross for everything.

1211
01:23:26,015 --> 01:23:29,110
And here
I come to the second reason.

1212
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:32,737
If you agree to help us

1213
01:23:32,821 --> 01:23:35,979
to ensure that Mr. Lefèvre
leaves the company,

1214
01:23:36,336 --> 01:23:39,646
I think it would be
a great opportunity for you,

1215
01:23:40,093 --> 01:23:43,119
to prove that
you are back in the saddle,

1216
01:23:43,203 --> 01:23:44,732
that you take back control.

1217
01:23:44,977 --> 01:23:47,937
It would allow everyone to say,

1218
01:23:48,412 --> 01:23:50,201
starting with Mr. Cooper:

1219
01:23:50,523 --> 01:23:51,674
"Of course,

1220
01:23:53,384 --> 01:23:56,776
he is cut out for the task
that we have entrusted to him."

1221
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,547
And I also say that...

1222
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,441
You know, I have great
respect for you,

1223
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:05,771
so I'm telling you as a friend,

1224
01:24:06,098 --> 01:24:08,882
it's also the opportunity to say:

1225
01:24:11,277 --> 01:24:12,845
"It was a misstep."

1226
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,595
And as to this setback,

1227
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:17,804
makes it a strength

1228
01:24:18,352 --> 01:24:20,562
a means for the future,

1229
01:24:20,909 --> 01:24:22,911
of your professional career.

1230
01:24:23,674 --> 01:24:25,840
Here's what I think.

1231
01:24:28,702 --> 01:24:31,700
Does it mean that,
if I accept your proposal,

1232
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:35,316
I start with a clean slate
for Mr. Cooper?

1233
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:38,902
Is that right?
As if nothing had happened?

1234
01:24:39,396 --> 01:24:42,501
I'm convinced
that he'd appreciate it.

1235
01:24:42,585 --> 01:24:43,794
For sure.

1236
01:25:16,146 --> 01:25:17,770
<i>Dear Mrs. Bonnet-Guérin,</i>

1237
01:25:18,877 --> 01:25:20,253
<i>A few days ago,</i>

1238
01:25:20,686 --> 01:25:25,318
<i>you gave me the chance
to renew the confidence</i>

1239
01:25:25,519 --> 01:25:27,574
<i>that the company
had initially placed in me.</i>

1240
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:32,854
<i>Thank you for giving me the
opportunity to prove who I am.</i>

1241
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,998
<i>By canceling the contract
of my Director of Operations,</i>

1242
01:25:37,082 --> 01:25:38,521
<i>Mr. Olivier Lefèvre,</i>

1243
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:42,396
<i>I'd avoid being fired
for my mistakes.</i>

1244
01:25:42,663 --> 01:25:44,104
<i>I'm lucky,</i>

1245
01:25:44,316 --> 01:25:46,095
<i>because, it is with your offer,</i>

1246
01:25:46,622 --> 01:25:49,524
<i>I could understand
what kind of man I have become</i>

1247
01:25:49,757 --> 01:25:53,497
<i>in your eyes and, without a doubt,
in the eyes of many others.</i>

1248
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,812
<i>A despicable man,</i>

1249
01:25:56,050 --> 01:26:00,146
<i>if you think I could
accept your proposal,</i>

1250
01:26:01,398 --> 01:26:03,728
<i>as I am solely responsible</i>

1251
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:06,998
<i>of any inefficiency
at my factory.</i>

1252
01:26:07,589 --> 01:26:10,104
<i>Responsible
for obliging the foremen</i>

1253
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:13,562
<i>to turn a blind eye
to dangerous procedures</i>

1254
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,562
<i>in assembly lines.</i>

1255
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:19,524
<i>Responsible for lying to my team,</i>

1256
01:26:19,736 --> 01:26:22,482
<i>while I was constantly abusing
their loyalty</i>

1257
01:26:22,754 --> 01:26:23,928
<i>and devotion.</i>

1258
01:26:25,601 --> 01:26:27,950
<i>I was the good soldier
that you wanted me to be.</i>

1259
01:26:28,662 --> 01:26:32,195
<i>You call that courage,
but I call it cowardice or stupidity.</i>

1260
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:35,523
<i>The few qualities I do possess,</i>

1261
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:39,244
<i>I didn't even need them
to see our madness.</i>

1262
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,448
<i>I've done all of this
for a hefty salary</i>

1263
01:26:42,838 --> 01:26:45,713
<i>and I certainly would
even for much less,</i>

1264
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:50,146
<i>because where I thought
to find intelligence</i>

1265
01:26:50,343 --> 01:26:53,312
<i>I found nothing but indecency.</i>

1266
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,726
<i>My freedom
certainly comes with a cost,</i>

1267
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:57,923
<i>but it's still priceless.</i>

1268
01:26:59,105 --> 01:27:02,937
<i>Consequently, I ask firmly</i>

1269
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:06,066
<i>that the totality of faults
that you attribute to me,</i>

1270
01:27:06,146 --> 01:27:09,104
<i>fall exclusively on me</i>

1271
01:27:09,388 --> 01:27:12,813
<i>and only on me,
as you phrased it.</i>

1272
01:27:13,063 --> 01:27:15,021
<i>Those words describe exactly</i>

1273
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:19,437
<i>the man in the position that
the Elsonn Group had entrusted to me.</i>

1274
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:24,270
<i>And most importantly, they describe
a man I don't want to have</i>

1275
01:27:24,588 --> 01:27:25,601
<i>as a friend</i>

1276
01:27:25,955 --> 01:27:27,271
<i>as a father</i>

1277
01:27:27,489 --> 01:27:29,114
<i>or as a husband.</i>

1278
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:30,965
<i>Sincerely,</i>

1279
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:33,020
<i>Philippe Lemesle.</i>
