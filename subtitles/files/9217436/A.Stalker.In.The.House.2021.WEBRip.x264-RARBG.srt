1
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,167
I can't do this anymore.

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,916
I can't deal with your
craziness, your jealousy.

3
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:28,249
You're literally acting like
a psycho. You're psychotic.

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,124
Look, you meet up
with your ex-boyfriend,

5
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,624
and when I'm supposed to
be all happy go lucky,

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,332
nice guy about it?

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
I need to break up with you.
Oh, don't start.

8
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:40,499
You don't respect me. I
need someone that respects me.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,999
I do respect you!
No, you don't!

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,416
We're done for good.
No, no, we're not done, okay?

11
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:48,457
Because I love you!
Mike,

12
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,707
how do two people that fight
all the time love each other?

13
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,332
We don't fight all the time!
Then what is this?

14
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:59,291
This is a conversation.
No! This is a breakup.

15
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,750
You're not dumping me.

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,749
Oh, so you're telling me
what I can and cannot do.

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,999
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,916
You're manipulating. You're controlling.

19
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:12,707
It's not normal! You need help!

20
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:16,457
You don't want normal.
I want normal.

21
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,291
It'd be a relief!
No, come on.

22
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,791
I know you!
God.

23
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,291
I know you. I know you,
and you don't want normal.

24
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,457
You, You

25
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,292
I know.

26
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,125
I know.
You don't know me.

27
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,125
I know you!

28
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:28,667
Calm down.

29
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:32,499
No, I don't want to calm down, okay?

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,499
You get me all worked up,
you turn it around on me,

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,667
and you call me crazy, and I hate that!

32
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,708
You're scaring me.

33
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,457
I wanna be with you forever.

34
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:50,582
I wanna be with you
always, and if it's just,

35
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:55,583
if I don't have you, if I don't
have you, then I'm nothing.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,167
Okay? I'm dead.

37
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,042
I don't know what to tell you.

38
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,291
I don't love you anymore, okay?

39
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,499
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,374
I did everything right by you!

41
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,207
And this is what happens?
You turn it around?

42
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,417
You turn it around and
you break up with me?

43
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,832
Okay, I'm gonna go.
No, no.

44
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,792
Okay, okay, okay.

45
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:20,249
Let me just- Mike,

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,250
Let me just get a breath.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

47
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:24,457
Okay? No, I'm not letting you leave.

48
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,417
You need to get out of my way!

49
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:27,416
No, I'm not letting you leave!

50
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:28,417
Move!
No!

51
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,874
Are you kidding me? You hit me?

52
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,332
I didn't mean
for it to be like that, okay?

53
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,250
I'm sorry. That'll never
happen again, okay?

54
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,666
This can work. It can work.
No.

55
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,625
No, you just hit me!

56
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,791
Okay, if you don't get out of my way,

57
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,833
I'm gonna call the police.

58
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,624
The police? What do you mean police?

59
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,999
What do you mean police? You're
gonna call the police on me?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,332
I don't even know you anymore!

61
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,291
You're a bad person!
Screw you!

62
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,958
I don't ever wanna see you again.

63
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,541
Now get out of my way or I'm

64
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,791
gonna tell everyone what you just did.

65
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,583
And if you do that, it will be very bad.

66
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,541
I am going, Mike.

67
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,102
If I can't have you, I will kill you.

68
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,124
I know I'd rather be dead

69
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,833
than deal with you for
the rest of my life.

70
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,125
So be it.

71
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,125
Stop! Stop!

72
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,000
You made me do this!

73
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,666
No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want it.

74
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,624
Come on, I'm horny,
and I know you are, too.

75
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,456
I'm not!

76
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:26,457
You said you were.

77
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,792
I didn't say it like that.

78
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:35,332
Look, I like you, and
you're super hot.

79
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,791
We just met. You don't
know anything about me.

80
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:42,792
I know that this is a very sexy body.

81
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,041
Let's just hang out.

82
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,624
I don't wanna have sex on the first night.

83
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,416
Let just take a breather.
We are hanging out.

84
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:57,166
This is fun.

85
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,541
No, no, no. No, no, no.

86
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,041
Hey, hey.
I like when you're mad.

87
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,916
No, this isn't a joke.

88
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:03,957
Come on.
Stop. Stop!

89
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:04,958
What?

90
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:09,166
I think you should just go.

91
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,499
Wait, are you serious?
Yeah.

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,166
I really think you should
just get your stuff and go.

93
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,250
Wait, are you crazy?

94
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,625
You know, it's women like you
that drive me insane, okay?

95
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,874
Well, you lead me on and
get all hot and heavy,

96
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,291
and then, what, you just change your mind?

97
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,791
It's unfair.
Unfair?

98
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,874
It's called controlling
yourself and not being a jerk!

99
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,875
Ah, fuck.

100
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:42,207
Okay, okay, I'll leave.

101
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:46,457
I don't wanna...

102
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,750
Mike, it's just not gonna
work out, okay? Sorry.

103
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:59,374
I'm tired, and I just
really wanna go to bed.

104
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,375
Okay.

105
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:06,458
I'll text you.
No, don't. Just...

106
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,542
I'll text you.
No, don't!

107
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,831
Hi, you've reached Jen's cell.

108
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,081
Please leave a message and I'll get back

109
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,292
to you as soon as I can.

110
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:01,417
Hello?
Jen. Jen, hey.

111
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:06,249
What happened? We were
having a good night.

112
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,082
What was wrong? What changed?

113
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,499
Nothing's wrong with
me. You were all over me.

114
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,249
We just met. I'm not that kind of girl.

115
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,583
No, I know you're not.

116
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,749
I was not saying that, okay?

117
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,291
I just, I like you.

118
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,749
I like you, and you said you liked me, so.

119
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,831
I did until you got all crazy.

120
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,331
Okay. I'm sorry.

121
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:29,581
Look, can I just come back in

122
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:32,041
and talk to you really quickly?

123
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,291
It's late, and you're wasted,

124
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,374
and the last thing I want
is you inside my house.

125
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,042
No, I'm not wasted, okay? Please?

126
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,166
I don't want you coming here.

127
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,331
Okay, well you can come
out to me. I'm still here.

128
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:46,457
I'm right out front.
You're still here?

129
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,792
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

130
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,832
I didn't wanna drive, so yeah.

131
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,832
I'm just out front. Look, please.

132
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,457
Just come out and talk
to me for a minute, okay?

133
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,916
I have nothing to say to you.

134
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,957
Okay, please just, pretty please,

135
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,291
'cause I just don't wanna leave and feel

136
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,541
like I've just been the most total weird,

137
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,916
worst creep in the world kind of thing.

138
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,874
And you won't have to
think of me like that

139
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,207
for the rest of eternity.

140
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,249
I don't care that much to think

141
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,249
about you for the rest of the eternity.

142
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,083
Okay. Well fine.

143
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:20,124
Okay, well then you just
come out here please,

144
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,333
and then you'll never
have to see me ever again.

145
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:31,332
Fine, but just one minute,

146
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,167
one minute.
All right, all right.

147
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,499
Hey.
Thank you for coming out.

148
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,041
Well, you practically begged, so-

149
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,750
Yeah, no, I just wanted
to apologize in person.

150
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,457
You know, you should know
when a girl's not into it.

151
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,416
You're old enough.
Yeah, I know.

152
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,916
I know, and I'm sorry.

153
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,457
Please, can I make it up to you somehow?

154
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,292
Whatever it takes, please.

155
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,166
I don't wanna see you again, okay?

156
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,332
Honestly, that's why I came
out here is to tell you that.

157
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,791
It's not gonna work out.

158
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,916
Why not?
Why not?

159
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,207
Yeah.
Because you're too much.

160
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,499
You're aggressive, and
that's not what I want.

161
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,791
I like sweet. I like nice.

162
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,082
What? No, no, I'm not aggressive.

163
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,332
I am sweet. I am nice, okay?

164
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,374
I just, I'm sensitive, okay?

165
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,499
I care, and I just, I hate that you think

166
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,833
that I'm not that person,
you know what I mean?

167
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,749
We could be friends.
Oh, geez, okay.

168
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,667
You know what, you're
a good looking guy.

169
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:39,457
I'm sure there's a lot
of girls that want you.

170
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,707
I don't want other girls.

171
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:46,666
We met online
on a dumb dating app, okay?

172
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,291
There's millions of other girls out there

173
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,957
that would sleep with
you on the first date.

174
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:50,792
Okay.

175
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:51,957
But this conversation's over,

176
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,957
and I'm gonna go back inside, okay?

177
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,624
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,124
It's fine, okay?

179
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,791
And I'm sorry to ask this.
This is so embarrassing.

180
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,124
Can I please quickly use your bathroom?

181
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,624
Please?
Seriously?

182
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,957
You're asking me this?
I know.

183
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,249
I suck, I suck, I suck.

184
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,791
I don't wanna do anything
illegal, and I'll be super quick.

185
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,374
Pretty please?
Okay, fine, fine. Come on.

186
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,041
You're like a little kid,
seriously so annoying.

187
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,750
All right, thank you. I'll be so quick.

188
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,749
Thank you, thank you.

189
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,749
Make it quick.
Yeah, of course.

190
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,167
Back to the right.
Back to the right, okay.

191
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,708
Door code, 3341.

192
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:16,042
Gerry Dilts.

193
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,542
Who the dell is Gerry Dilts?

194
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,957
Thank you so much. I needed that.

195
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,916
Yeah. Okay.

196
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:52,291
Can I actually just grab
a quick glass of water?

197
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,707
Sorry. I got a massive headache.

198
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,542
You serious?

199
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,999
It's the alcohol. I'm dehydrated.

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,041
Can't believe I'm pouring
you water, but okay.

201
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:03,374
Thanks. Ah, you got chips?

202
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,583
This isn't a free cafeteria.

203
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,292
Oh my God. Thank you, you're sweet.

204
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:17,458
I'm not sweet, I'm annoyed.
You're very demanding.

205
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,125
I hate that you think of me like that.

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,666
So you wanna hang out again sometime soon?

207
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,041
You're kidding.

208
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,291
Well, there has to be a
reason you let me back in here.

209
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,917
And now I regret it.

210
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,124
Look at me, I'm normal. I'm a good guy.

211
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,707
Normal?
I'm eating normal.

212
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,041
Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,999
You're persistent, I'll give you that.

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,791
Okay, well that's a good trait.

215
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,832
I guess. I'm tired, okay?

216
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,667
Okay.
Go.

217
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:52,291
No, I'll leave. I'll leave.

218
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,042
Okay, can I text you?
Text me?

219
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,332
If you text me and I do not text you back,

220
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,457
you can't send me more messages.

221
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,749
Okay.

222
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,750
All right, so email, telegraph,
snail mail, smoke signal.

223
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,499
Oh, you're funny.
There's a smile.

224
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,499
'Cause you're
completely ridiculous.

225
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,458
Okay, all right. I'm
gonna leave you alone.

226
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,249
But I'm just gonna quick peck on the cheek

227
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,749
and apologize one more time, that's it.

228
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,832
You've apologized a
thousand times, okay?

229
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,999
I know. Okay, I'm gonna take this.

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,917
Uh huh.
Okay.

231
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:25,917
But I'm gonna text you.

232
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,791
Okay, bye. See you.
Bye.

233
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:35,958
Thanks. I'm gonna text you.

234
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,999
Mike.

235
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,249
"Got a second today? Just wanna talk.

236
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,875
Text me back please."

237
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,124
"Sorry I was a jerk last night.

238
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,417
How about we start over? XO, Mike."

239
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,999
Wow. What a total loser.

240
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,958
And the idiot just keeps texting me.

241
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,541
You need to block
him. What are you doing?

242
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,249
I might have to.

243
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,375
You need to block him now.

244
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,250
Oh my gosh. He's calling me.

245
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,082
Mike is calling me right now.

246
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,763
What? Give me your phone.
What do I do?

247
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:29,499
Hey, it's Lisa. Yeah, I'm Jen's friend.

248
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,832
Hey. So, listen.

249
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:36,957
I think you should stop calling
Jen. She's not interested.

250
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,624
Bugging her and bothering
her and it's not okay.

251
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:44,208
She doesn't like you that
way, you understand me? Hello?

252
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,999
He hung up.
You know what? Who cares?

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,541
Yeah, I mean like onto
better guys anyways.

254
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:56,208
Babe, no more of those
creepy losers. Oh, gross.

255
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:00,541
But what's more important
is my best friend,

256
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:05,499
you need to find a good guy and
I know the good guy for you.

257
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,665
So he's a chef and he works

258
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,874
at a really, really expensive restaurants.

259
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,582
Chef, huh?
Yeah.

260
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,083
Imagine all the great
food you can eat for free!

261
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,292
Are you kidding me?

262
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,833
You left your watch here.

263
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,041
Did you leave it on purpose?

264
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,166
No, I swear.

265
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:17,791
No, please, can I just stop
by real quick and pick it up?

266
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,374
Yeah, I'll leave it out back for you.

267
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,832
Can you not, please?
Look, it's a $5,000 watch.

268
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,374
My dad gave it to me before he died.

269
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,082
Can you just not leave it outside, please?

270
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,707
Okay. Then come get it.

271
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,042
Yeah. I will be over
there as soon as I can.

272
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,291
Hey. Thanks.

273
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:52,292
Hey, I got you this gift, a
token of, it's an apology.

274
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,624
I was a jerk last night,
and I got way too drunk,

275
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,832
and I'm sorry, and I was just hoping

276
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,542
that maybe we could've a fresh start.

277
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,832
So you brought a bottle of wine?

278
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,541
Yeah, I figured we could've a glass.

279
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,041
Do you not see the irony of it?

280
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:11,166
Yes, I do now, actually,

281
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:15,207
but it's a really nice bottle of wine.

282
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,166
You are the most
persistent guy I've ever met.

283
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,167
So it's not a no.

284
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,957
I don't drink in the middle of the day.

285
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,957
Oh come on. It's not
the middle of the day.

286
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,916
Besides, what else do you have going on?

287
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,791
I have to study. I have homework.

288
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,249
I'm in school. I'm
trying to better myself.

289
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,541
You don't need to better yourself.

290
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,332
I mean, that was corny, I know, but-

291
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,332
The answer is no.
Just one glass.

292
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,167
It's not gonna kill you.

293
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:38,582
Did you leave your
watch here on purpose?

294
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,332
What? No, no.

295
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,374
I swear. That's weird.

296
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,624
Then why did you leave
it in the bathroom?

297
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,916
I was washing my hands?

298
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,916
So you take your watch
off to wash your hands.

299
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:50,917
That's a thing?

300
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:55,041
Yeah, I mean, it's a
really expensive watch, so.

301
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,999
Look, one glass of wine.
It's rush hour right now.

302
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,374
I'd really prefer to have a glass of wine

303
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,832
with you rather than being in traffic.

304
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:08,791
Fine, one tiny drink, but
you are terribly exhausting.

305
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:09,999
One drink.
One.

306
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,457
Okay.
Just one.

307
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,166
One, all right.

308
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,125
You're such a screw ball.

309
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:25,208
Hey, did I tell you you
have a really nice place?

310
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,332
Thanks, just moved in.

311
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,416
Yeah, it's like a minimalist vibe.

312
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, I don't like clutter.
Where do you live again?

313
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:39,333
A little ways from here, yeah. Not far.

314
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,333
Hey, how about a toast?

315
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,417
To new beginnings?

316
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,583
That is so corny.

317
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Cheers.

318
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:02,499
I really like you, and I would really like

319
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,875
to take you on a real
date, you know, dinner.

320
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:10,792
Well, as charming as you
are, Mike, you're not my type.

321
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,124
Why not?

322
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,041
What? Because I don't
like you like that.

323
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,749
There's no chemistry between us.

324
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,832
Yes, there is. I can feel it, okay?

325
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,041
It's there.
Not for me.

326
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:24,249
I got you flowers and a card.

327
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,750
And I threw them out.
Ouch.

328
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,125
Look, I'm a good guy, okay?

329
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,832
You don't have to convince me.

330
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,124
This is not how you win over a girl.

331
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,374
Well, how do you win over a girl?

332
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,707
Well, you don't win me
over. You lost.

333
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,249
You know what? I think we
should just forget the drink.

334
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,374
What?
I think it's time

335
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,833
for you to go.
No, just relax!

336
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,791
No, just get out.

337
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:53,124
I just, I can't believe I
even let you convince me

338
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,374
to let you in here.

339
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,207
Like this is crazy.
No, no, look, look.

340
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,832
Just relax, okay? Please.

341
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,332
Okay, just listen.
No, I'm over this.

342
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,749
Get out!
What, no! Just come on!

343
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,832
Get out!

344
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,624
Don't do that!

345
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,666
I'm calling the cops.
What? No, stop, stop!

346
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,124
Give me my phone back.
Stop, okay. No.

347
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,416
I'll scream and the neighbors will hear,

348
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,042
and then they will call the cops.

349
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,625
I don't think that that is a good idea.

350
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,374
Are you threatening me?

351
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,125
No, no, no, no, no, look, no.

352
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,207
I don't wanna hurt you, all right?

353
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,041
I just wanna hang out.
Look, let's drink some wine.

354
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:32,042
I don't want any more
wine. I want you to go!

355
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:37,499
Look, please. Stop yelling at me, okay?

356
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,666
Don't hurt me.

357
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:43,667
Oh, I would never hurt a female, okay?

358
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,417
Okay, then go because you're scaring me.

359
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,874
Okay, I'll leave. I'll leave.

360
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,666
It's just that we didn't hang out.

361
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,582
You didn't give me a real chance.

362
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,541
Because you're crazy, okay?

363
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,792
Just go! Just get out!

364
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:07,291
I think now is the time for you to go.

365
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,708
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

366
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,542
Sorry.

367
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:34,917
Who the hell is that guy?

368
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:37,166
It was the worst
online date I've ever had

369
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,874
in my entire life.
Yeah.

370
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,457
I heard you guys yelling and screaming.

371
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,749
I mean, that's why I came over.

372
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,041
Otherwise I wouldn't have.

373
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,749
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

374
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,791
I'm glad you came over.

375
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,916
It was actually really, really scary.

376
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:52,417
What happened?

377
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,374
What a creep!

378
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,332
I swear if I see that guy on the street,

379
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,624
I'm gonna have a few words
with him, maybe a fist.

380
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:16,207
Ugh. I just wanna forget
about that guy altogether.

381
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,375
Yeah, well at least he
brought some wine, right?

382
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,167
Cheers.

383
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,082
So I guess you and Gerry
are no longer together

384
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,125
since you're online dating.

385
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:37,291
Yeah, well, it's complicated, but yeah.

386
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:41,999
Well, you do happen to
have a nice guy neighbor

387
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,707
who's always had a little
bit of a crush on you.

388
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,332
Patrick.

389
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,874
I live right next
door, too, just saying.

390
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:50,875
Sweet.

391
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:52,917
I don't know.

392
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,624
I just don't know if
right now is a good time,

393
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,250
and I just don't think it's a good idea.

394
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,874
I can respect that.
That's cool, that's cool.

395
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,875
Well, I guess I'll let
you get back to studying.

396
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:09,249
Psychology, right?
You remembered.

397
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,916
Of course. I love psychology.

398
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:13,374
I think the mind is fascinating.

399
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,749
Me, too.

400
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,207
It was good to see you.
I'll see you around, I guess.

401
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,707
Yeah, see you.
That's okay.

402
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:23,167
I'll walk myself out.
Okay.

403
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,625
Hello?

404
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:39,125
Hello?

405
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:58,082
I don't know. He seems so nice.

406
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,041
Maybe I should've given him a chance.

407
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:02,707
Who? Patrick?

408
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,707
Babe, you don't wanna date a neighbor.

409
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,583
I mean, think about it this way.

410
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:07,166
What if it turns out ugly?

411
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:10,332
Then you're stuck with a dude
living right next door to you.

412
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,250
I never thought about that.

413
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:12,625
That could get weird quick.

414
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:14,832
No, Rick.
Ooh, yeah.

415
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,499
Has he texted you yet?
Did you give him my number?

416
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,999
Yeah. I thought
you said it was okay.

417
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,583
Geez, no! I wish you
would've asked me first.

418
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,457
Okay, fine. Sorry.
It's okay.

419
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,416
Wait, why didn't he text me then?

420
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,957
I'll make sure he does.
No, no, no, no, no.

421
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,457
I don't wanna seem desperate.

422
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,707
Who cares anyways?

423
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,957
It doesn't matter if he texts you or not

424
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:37,249
because your bestie, IE me,

425
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,542
just met Mr. football
coach's younger brother.

426
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:43,500
He's so hot.
You're terrible.

427
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,666
Sweetie, I'm just looking out for you.

428
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,499
I mean like, hey, now you have options.

429
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,332
If Rick the chef doesn't work out,

430
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,332
at least you got the hot doctor
waiting right in the wings,

431
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,166
all thanks to moi.

432
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,541
Wait, can I just skip the
chef and go right to the doctor?

433
00:30:57,542 --> 00:31:00,875
Mm mm. Babe, chefs actually
make good money, too.

434
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,874
You can date 'em both.

435
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,124
You're terrible. Terrible,
terrible, terrible.

436
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:11,457
Oh yeah? Well how's the
psychology going, doctor?

437
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,375
Good.

438
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:15,499
In two years time, I will
be a licensed therapist.

439
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,707
Two years? That's it?

440
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,833
Mm-hmm.
Wow.

441
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,791
You know what? I think
you'll make a fine therapist.

442
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,707
Thank you.
You're welcome.

443
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:26,499
Ooh, is that Rick?
I think so.

444
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,957
What did he say? What did he say?

445
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:32,624
Okay, he said, "Hey,
Jen. It's nice to connect."

446
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,041
Lisa speaks very highly of you

447
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,082
and was kind enough to
show me your photos.

448
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,749
You are absolutely stunning.

449
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,875
"I would love to take you out for a drink."

450
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,332
What'd you say?
Perfect.

451
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,375
I officially have a
date with Rick the chef!

452
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,416
I take all the credit,
thank you very much.

453
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:55,499
Yes! Okay, I
have so much homework to do.

454
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,374
I have a huge test coming up.

455
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,832
Really?
Yes.

456
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,416
Are you okay to drive?
Mm-hmm.

457
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:04,042
Sweetie, always good to drive.

458
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:23,708
In the car.

459
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,792
Don't move or I'll kill you.

460
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,250
Good. Thanks, Lisa.

461
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,667
It didn't ring. You're outta luck.

462
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,625
How do you know my name?

463
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,000
We spoke on the phone.
Mike? You're Mike?

464
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,582
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

465
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,832
You're insane, man. You're
not right in the head.

466
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:57,291
Jen and I are perfect together, okay?

467
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:00,833
I sense it. She could be my wife.

468
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:04,999
You're insane.

469
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
No, I'm not insane, okay?
Everyone around me is insane.

470
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:15,375
You leave Jen alone. Get outta my car.

471
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,000
I have a knife.

472
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,125
What are you gonna do, kill me?

473
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,791
Well, you haven't really left me

474
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:26,583
with much choice, have you?

475
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:33,208
You know, you're kind of beautiful.

476
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,583
That's it, that's it, that's it.

477
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,207
You know, it's
really pretty outside.

478
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,499
Yeah.
Yeah.

479
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,416
Hey, thank you so much
for walking me back.

480
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,666
I just wanna let you know
that I had a great time.

481
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:19,082
You're a cool girl. I'm
really glad Lisa introduced us.

482
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,333
You're a cool guy.

483
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:25,166
That was sweet.
It was.

484
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:28,707
Hey, do you wanna maybe
come in, have some wine?

485
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,916
Sounds like a great idea. I'd love to.

486
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,667
Lead the way.
Okay.

487
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,916
I really like you.
Yeah?

488
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,166
What do you like about me?
You're hot.

489
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,666
Is that all?

490
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:04,041
No, of course not.
You're smart, you're sexy.

491
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:05,583
You're the full package.

492
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,707
Mm, good answer.
Yeah?

493
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:10,708
Yeah.

494
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,832
Wait.
What is it?

495
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,416
I don't have sex on the first date.

496
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,874
Is it okay if we just kiss?

497
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,582
Yeah, I'm cool with that.
Yeah?

498
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,583
Where were we?
Okay.

499
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,541
So when do I
get to see you again?

500
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:37,374
When do you want to?

501
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,667
How about I come by
tonight and cook for you?

502
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:43,457
Are you playing
the chef card on me?

503
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:45,332
It's a very strong card, you know.

504
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,208
People say I'm really good at it.

505
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:52,250
Okay, chef boy. Come by tonight.

506
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,749
What's up, man?

507
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,583
Hey, what's up, bud?

508
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,958
You waiting on a ride?

509
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,791
Yeah. How did you know that?

510
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:13,500
So how was she?
Excuse me?

511
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,292
Jen.
You know Jen?

512
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,582
You guys did it, didn't you?

513
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,875
I don't really wanna talk
about it. It's kind of weird.

514
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:26,249
Why does she like you?
Why does she like you, man?

515
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,082
Look, man, this is
getting a little weird.

516
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,624
You have a good day.
No, no.

517
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,042
I'm out.
Tell me, tell me!

518
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,041
Hi, you've reached Jen's cell.

519
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:32,541
Please leave a message and I'll get back

520
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:37,083
to you as soon as I can.

521
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,624
Hey, Rick. So much for cooking tonight.

522
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,874
Guess you're just one
date wonder kind of guy.

523
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,208
Hope you had fun, jerk.

524
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,541
Hey Rick. So much for cooking tonight.

525
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:22,207
Guess you're just one
date wonder kind of guy.

526
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,333
Hope you had fun, jerk.

527
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,083
What are you doing here?

528
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,332
I thought I told you I never
wanted to see you again.

529
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,207
Well, I was in the neighborhood,

530
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,124
and I saw your light on, so.

531
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,916
What are you doing, stalking me?

532
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:07,582
No, I just thought maybe
you could use some company.

533
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,917
And what makes you
think I want your company?

534
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,874
Must be tough being
so harsh all the time.

535
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,332
Try being nice.

536
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,749
What do you want from me huh?

537
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,624
You wanna get lucky, sex?

538
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:22,000
I actually really like
you, really like you,

539
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,583
and, I don't know, been
thinking about you a lot,

540
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,041
and I don't know, maybe
I'm like falling for you.

541
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:35,791
Falling for me? You
don't know anything about me.

542
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,332
Okay, so maybe I'm crazy.

543
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,957
Yeah, I would say, like
actually mentally ill.

544
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,457
You're nuts.
Okay, all right.

545
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,499
Well, I can't be that nuts

546
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,582
because I do all right for myself.

547
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,791
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.

548
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:50,791
What is it that you do
when you're not stalking?

549
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:53,207
Okay, I'm not stalking you.

550
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,332
You know, talking to
you is very exhausting.

551
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,374
Okay, well, how about you let me in,

552
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:02,458
and we can just relax, not
even talk, and no touching.

553
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:04,458
We just relax.

554
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,791
You know the only reason
why I'm gonna let you in

555
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,582
is because I don't want
my neighbors to see this

556
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,499
like they did last time, remember?

557
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,416
And that was very embarrassing.

558
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,499
Okay.

559
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,042
Just get in.

560
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,542
Do you mind if I pour myself a drink?

561
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,083
Fine.
Cool. Thank you.

562
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,999
So what's wrong?

563
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,874
I mean, besides me being
here because I'm the worst.

564
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:44,167
I'm a jerk. I get it. No, what's up?

565
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,250
I'm not gonna tell you my problems.

566
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:48,249
I have a therapist, thank you very much.

567
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,291
Okay, well, I can just listen
and then won't charge you.

568
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:57,166
Well, for one, I
was supposed to be cooked for.

569
00:42:57,167 --> 00:43:00,583
Like the date?
Yes, the date. Stood up.

570
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,291
Well, you know, it's
his loss, or, you know,

571
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,833
it could be the universe
sending you like a sign.

572
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:14,583
Yeah, you know, like, the perfect
man right is front of you.

573
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,625
It's funny.

574
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,791
'Cause it's really corny.

575
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,125
But, you know, I can cook
for you. What do you got?

576
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,332
What do you got?

577
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,916
Good luck finding anything in there.

578
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:30,792
Okay, I'm sure I can find something.

579
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,500
Not much. Okay.

580
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,917
Freezer?

581
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,749
Frozen nuggets. Yes.

582
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,166
Those have been in there forever.

583
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,542
Well, they're frozen,
so they're still good.

584
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm gonna nuke 'em.

585
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:01,042
Sorry about blocking you.

586
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:06,291
Whoa. Did you apologize to me?

587
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:08,082
No, I regret it.
I think you-

588
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,249
No, I'm just, no, I just,

589
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,958
I think I'm a little tipsy.

590
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,082
Voila.

591
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,833
Mm.
Mm. How is it?

592
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,666
Pretty good.
Yeah?

593
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,000
Mm-hmm.
Good.

594
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,625
You seem tense. Come on.

595
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,875
Mm-hmm.
How's that?

596
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:40,417
Yep.

597
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,041
No, no.
Why not?

598
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,957
I can't.
Why?

599
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:48,792
Just relax.
'Cause you remember

600
00:44:48,793 --> 00:44:50,042
what happened last time.

601
00:44:56,083 --> 00:45:00,000
Just relax, okay?
This is such a bad idea.

602
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,583
How about here? This is good.

603
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:21,332
You are the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

604
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,833
I told you to
stop. Don't.

605
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,041
Okay, I'll shut up.

606
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,542
Yeah, shut up. No more.

607
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:27,708
Oh my God.

608
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,874
That was incredible.

609
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,792
Lisa's gonna kill me.

610
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:42,917
Lisa? The friend that chewed me out?

611
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,417
That's the one.

612
00:46:48,292 --> 00:46:51,332
You know, I don't think
she'll kill you, all right?

613
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:54,166
You don't know here.

614
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:58,417
Yeah, I guess we weren't
officially introduced.

615
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,999
Can't believe I just
slept with my stalker.

616
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,167
Oh my God. I'm not your stalker.

617
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:10,291
You got what you
wanted, Mike. You happy?

618
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:13,707
What are talking about? I like you.

619
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:15,124
What, you wanna be my boyfriend?

620
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,332
Yeah, yeah.
Is that what you're-

621
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,542
I'd like to be boyfriend.
I'd love to be her boyfriend.

622
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:24,292
You know, maybe I can
even be more than that.

623
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:30,833
You know what? I'm tired,
and I think should go home.

624
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:36,042
You're kicking me out even
though we just made love?

625
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:40,624
Love? That was not making love, okay?

626
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,249
You know what? I hate that expression.

627
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,624
Please don't ever say that again.

628
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:47,583
Okay, so what was it then?

629
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:51,167
Honestly, a mistake.

630
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,208
All right.

631
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,749
So I'll text you then in like a day

632
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,750
or two days or when the timing's right.

633
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:05,958
Now you're getting it.

634
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,250
Okay.

635
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,624
Hey, it's Lisa.

636
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:33,417
I'm not available, so leave a message.

637
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:47,667
Hello?

638
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:27,875
Friends.

639
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,375
Okay, okay.

640
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:44,542
Hi.
Hey.

641
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:51,042
How are you?

642
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:55,500
I'm good. How are you?
Good, good. How's work?

643
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:59,249
Good. So how about you?

644
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,249
How's the psychology going?
Good, I guess.

645
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,083
Well, I'm really glad

646
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,564
to see you following through with it.

647
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:07,750
Yeah.

648
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,958
Here's your mail.
Oh.

649
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,833
So how you been?

650
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,667
You mean since you dumped me?

651
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:21,333
I did not dump you.

652
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,624
Then what would you call that?

653
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,041
I would call it that I had
to leave the country for work.

654
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:28,832
I was gonna be in London for six months,

655
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,583
and I didn't think it
would be fair to you.

656
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,916
So you broke up with me for my own good?

657
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,416
Jen, six months is a long time.

658
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:42,541
I didn't want you to
be lonely and I thought

659
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,458
for sure you'd be with someone by now.

660
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:48,125
Wait, are you with someone?

661
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:52,041
Well, I've been on a couple of dates,

662
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:54,417
but no, I'm not with anybody.

663
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,457
No Prince Charmings.

664
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:01,832
That's funny.
No, no Prince Charming.

665
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:02,833
What's so funny?

666
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,541
I don't know.

667
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:09,416
I have this stalker guy that
thinks he's Prince Charming.

668
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:11,083
Did you just say you have a stalker?

669
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,625
That was delicious.

670
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:13,082
Yeah.

671
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:15,833
I missed you so much.
I missed you.

672
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,457
You know I
thought about you every day?

673
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:28,291
Same. So hard when you left.

674
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,125
I cried everyday for months.

675
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,500
You and I, we belong together.

676
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,333
I just wanna move back in,
pick up where we left off,

677
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,416
but better than before.

678
00:53:42,417 --> 00:53:44,125
I don't wanna get hurt again, Gerry.

679
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,583
I never meant to hurt you.
But you did.

680
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:54,750
I know, and when I think
about it, I feel awful.

681
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:01,833
You didn't deserve that.
You deserve so much better.

682
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,292
I'm really happy about this.

683
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:43,416
I'm gonna go to the
hotel and get some stuff,

684
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:46,957
take care of a few things, and
then I can come back tonight.

685
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:47,833
Okay.

686
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:52,083
I'm ready to make us work.
I wasn't before, but I am now.

687
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:56,417
I love you.

688
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:06,332
Your call has been forwarded

689
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,666
to an automated voice message-

690
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:08,667
Bitch.

691
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,792
Your call has been.

692
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:22,582
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

693
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,916
Mike, what are you doing
here? This has to stop.

694
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:28,291
There was never anything between us.

695
00:58:28,292 --> 00:58:30,333
You know, Jen, you deserve to be happy,

696
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,082
and if this Gerry guy,

697
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:37,333
if being with his Gerry
guy makes you happy,

698
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,625
then you should be with him.

699
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:43,042
Thank you. I appreciate that.

700
00:58:43,043 --> 00:58:44,458
But you should also know

701
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:48,333
that this behavior is disgusting.

702
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,124
You're a slut, but for some reason,

703
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,624
What are you doing?
I love you.

704
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:55,458
I love you with my whole
heart. This is what love-

705
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,833
Get out!

706
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:01,249
I'll call the cops and file
a restraining order on you!

707
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,916
You wanna take it there,
huh? You wanna take it there?

708
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:05,666
You think you can just walk into my life,

709
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,291
turn it upside down, and then leave?

710
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:09,542
Please get out. You're scaring me.

711
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:13,792
I'm leaving.

712
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:21,332
You know, I will get that
restraining order, okay?

713
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:24,042
And then if you ever back
here, you will get arrested.

714
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:28,166
It's really nice, Jen.

715
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:31,833
Sleep with someone, get a
restraining order. Classy.

716
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,083
Go to hell.
Bitch.

717
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:55,083
Hi, I would like to file
a restraining order. Mm-hmm.

718
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:58,208
Okay. Okay.

719
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Thank you.

720
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:03,207
So I guess they're gonna
call me back in the morning

721
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,916
so a detective can talk to me.

722
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:08,582
Hey, babe, listen. I'm here.

723
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,124
I'm not gonna let this Mike guy near you.

724
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:13,166
Thank you.
Of course.

725
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:14,374
I mean, when you said you had a stalker,

726
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,499
I had no idea it was this serious.

727
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,541
Well, it wasn't, and
then he just shows up

728
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:23,582
out of the blue uninvited and he explodes.

729
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:27,625
Just I'm so angry.

730
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,124
You know what? Maybe I should
go to a kickboxing class.

731
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:35,125
I feel like I need a hit something.

732
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,999
Well, you can hit me
right here. Go ahead.

733
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,792
No, I don't wanna hit you.

734
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:47,917
I wanna hit him, like just,
in the face.

735
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,750
Nice combo.

736
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:51,708
Thanks. Don't mess with me.

737
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,916
I really should go, though,

738
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,708
and it'll make me feel a lot better.

739
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:58,749
All right.

740
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,333
Well listen, if it makes you
feel better, you should go.

741
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,791
And hey, it's only an hour, okay?

742
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:07,333
So make yourself at home, wine, whiskey.

743
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,374
Hi, you've reached Jen's cell.

744
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:13,375
Please leave a message,

745
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:15,583
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

746
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:46,083
What's up, Gerry?

747
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:56,874
Who the hell are you?
I'm Mike. I'm with Jen.

748
01:01:56,875 --> 01:02:01,125
Right, Mike. You're the stalker.

749
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:05,916
How'd you get in here? You
watched her enter the code?

750
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:08,499
I'm not an idiot.
I didn't say you were.

751
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,166
You realize what you're
doing right now is illegal.

752
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,500
Breaking and entering? It's a felony.

753
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:18,082
Is that what you want, to go to jail?

754
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:19,833
I don't see how that would work.

755
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:28,832
You got my phone?

756
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:33,041
Yeah, I got it. I also have this.

757
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,042
Oh.

758
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,083
You're gonna shoot me?

759
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:40,457
You think if you kill me,

760
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:43,874
Jen is gonna come crawling back
to you? Think about it, man.

761
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:47,000
You've been stalking her.
She thinks you're crazy.

762
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,707
There is no path to victory here for you.

763
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:56,208
The best thing that you
can do is leave, now.

764
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:03,542
You know, I understand
why she would like you.

765
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:08,208
You're a pretty good-looking guy, Gerry,

766
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,417
yeah, pretty well put together.

767
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:16,291
Nice ride, great career, I bet.

768
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:20,042
Older guy, more money,
but you broke her heart.

769
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,249
You had your chance.

770
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,624
You don't just get to come back

771
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:30,957
into her life and ruin it again.

772
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:31,958
Okay.

773
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:36,917
I will leave her alone if
that's what you want, okay?

774
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,541
You can have her.
Leave her alone.

775
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:44,167
That's how it's gonna work, smarty pants?

776
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:50,041
No, man. We're drawing a line in the sand.

777
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:53,957
What does that mean?
We've come too far.

778
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:57,833
I have to fix this.
You've become a liability.

779
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:05,125
Come on, man. You're not
gonna really shoot me, are you?

780
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:08,374
I can't shoot you. That
would be way too loud.

781
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:11,792
So I'm just gonna do this.

782
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:26,166
Can't believe you forgot about me.

783
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,250
I would never forget about you.

784
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:31,292
What did you do to Gerry?

785
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,417
Nothing. No, he decided to go home.

786
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:38,666
Yeah, yeah, he understands
that we're together now,

787
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:40,917
and he accepts it.

788
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,583
He's a really good guy, Jen.

789
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,542
Why don't you take a seat?

790
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,332
Yeah, look, the problem solves,

791
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,625
So this is a good thing.

792
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,583
What do you mean?
Gerry.

793
01:06:07,917 --> 01:06:09,957
You know, coming back into the picture.

794
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:12,624
Now he's back out of the picture.

795
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:17,042
So we can focus on us.
Did you hurt him?

796
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:20,874
No, no, no. He went home.

797
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:24,667
Just us so we can focus on us, right?

798
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:27,833
You have a gun.
Yeah.

799
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:29,917
Yeah, but that's not the answer

800
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:31,833
to the question I was asking.

801
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:36,749
What do you want?

802
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:40,833
What do I want? You don't
know what I want by now?

803
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:48,083
I want you, Jen. I want your love.

804
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,292
I want your smell,

805
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:56,417
your taste.

806
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,083
I want your mouth,

807
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:04,375
face.

808
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:14,542
I want your skin.

809
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,917
I want everything from you.

810
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,083
I love you, Jen.

811
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,333
And do you feel the same?

812
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:38,000
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

813
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:42,582
You're lying. You're lying.

814
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:43,874
I don't like it when you lie to me.

815
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:46,832
No, I'm not lying, Mike.

816
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:50,708
You know, Jen, I'm not an idiot, okay?

817
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,832
You don't wanna be with me.
No, that's not true.

818
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:55,833
That's not true.

819
01:07:57,292 --> 01:08:01,457
Remember the night that we
first met and we were at the bar

820
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:06,291
and then we came back here and we kissed?

821
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:07,917
But I felt the connection.

822
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,167
You felt it?

823
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,333
You're a good guy.
You're just misunderstood.

824
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,249
I am.
Yeah.

825
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,958
I am just misunderstood.

826
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:32,082
The safety was on. You
just tried to shoot me!

827
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,082
I can't believe you
just tried to shoot me!

828
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:39,083
You could've killed
me! What are you doing?

829
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:43,082
I'm sorry.

830
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,499
Now I gotta punish you!

831
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,916
Okay, come on. Shh shh, easy.

832
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,957
Okay. All right, sit down here.

833
01:08:58,958 --> 01:08:59,958
Sit down. Sit down!

834
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,750
I didn't wanna have to do this.

835
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:08,166
I don't wanna have to do this, okay?

836
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:11,291
Put your hands behind your back.

837
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:14,708
Don't move, okay? You'll hurt yourself.

838
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:22,291
Stay there! See, now you have
to have to be punished now.

839
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,041
You know, hands back.

840
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,375
Don't move. Don't move.

841
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,541
Okay. Okay.

842
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,625
Let me out. Please.

843
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,540
I didn't wanna have to do this, okay?

844
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:50,916
You did this. You did this.

845
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,999
Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh.

846
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,083
No. Please, no, no, no.

847
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:04,083
Okay, it's all right. There we go.

848
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:07,874
Shh, shh. What if you shot me?

849
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,625
You went to shoot me.

850
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,291
You made me do this, you know?

851
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:18,374
I didn't wanna hurt you.
I didn't wanna hurt you.

852
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,625
We're meant to be together, you know, Jen.

853
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,916
We're supposed to be together!
I know it, I know it.

854
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:33,250
We could have a house together, you know?

855
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:39,750
Oh mean, that'd be so
nice. That'd be so nice.

856
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:46,041
Okay, I think you just need to sit there

857
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,958
and reset this temporary situation, okay?

858
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,420
Then you'll see what I'm
trying to achieve, okay?

859
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:02,875
Okay.

860
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:05,708
Just gonna give you some time, okay? Okay.

861
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:52,415
I made you a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

862
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:56,625
You know, it was my
favorite, or unless you want,

863
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,165
I can do the chicken
nuggets again if you prefer.

864
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,625
I nuke 'em.

865
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,708
Okay, I'm just gonna...

866
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:08,916
I guess you can't really...

867
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:14,249
Okay, okay. I can't
understand what you're saying.

868
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,874
If I take the tape off,
are you gonna scream?

869
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:17,875
Are you gonna scream?

870
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:22,583
Shh.

871
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,083
Ooh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

872
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:29,915
Want some water? Here, have some water.

873
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:32,125
Have some water. There
you go, there you go.

874
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:38,166
I have to go to the bathroom.

875
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:40,665
Really?

876
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:42,708
I swear. I really have to go.

877
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:45,540
The old bathroom trick.

878
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:48,875
You know, I did that on
you. I really need to go.

879
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,250
Yeah, no, you're right.

880
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,707
I just wanted to plant my
watch so I could come back.

881
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:59,207
You're smart, you're
smart. It's kind of scary.

882
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,583
It's not a trick. I really have to go.

883
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Please.

884
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,790
Okay, I can escort you, all right?

885
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:09,249
But you're gonna have to
go with the door open.

886
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,332
You're gonna have to go, and
I'm gonna have to watch you.

887
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:15,000
I'm gonna have to watch you go, okay?

888
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:19,000
You still wanna go?
Yeah.

889
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:24,208
If you pull anything, I got a gun.

890
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:31,499
So if you do anything, I'll
hurt, Jen. I'll hurt you.

891
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,291
I understand! Please.

892
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,333
Okay.

893
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:46,125
Okay, all yours.

894
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:50,124
Uh uh!
I can't go with it open.

895
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,040
Yes you can.
Please.

896
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:54,832
It's a psychological
thing. I get really tense.

897
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,083
Please, just can I shut it?

898
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,415
Okay. You got 30 seconds, okay.

899
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,291
30 seconds!
Okay, okay.

900
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,874
That's enough, all right?

901
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:28,333
Come on. You're welcome.

902
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,291
Okay. Go to the pole.

903
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,749
Yeah, see? Easy.

904
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:45,416
That feel better? Drink this, drink this.

905
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,374
That's it, that's it. Yeah, nice.

906
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:49,875
Okay. Good.

907
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:53,790
All right, hands behind your back.

908
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:56,374
No.
Hands behind your back!

909
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,291
No.

910
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:00,999
Do it. Okay, good, good, good.

911
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,458
That's it.

912
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,874
All right. That's it.

913
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:08,791
You're doing so good.
You're doing so good.

914
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:11,416
So good.

915
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,000
Okay, okay. Shh, that's it.

916
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,750
Okay.

917
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:24,082
No, no, no. No, no.

918
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,582
It's all right. It's all right.

919
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:29,624
No, no, please, please,
please, please. I won't scream.

920
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:33,541
I won't scream, Mike. Please.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

921
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:39,625
Don't you wanna kiss me?

922
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,250
Yeah, Mike. Touch me.

923
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:51,125
Sneaky, sneaky! Come on, Jen!

924
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:54,625
Dammit.

925
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,165
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

926
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:02,541
We're gonna have to kill you.

927
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,125
Ah, sneaky, sneaky.

928
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:10,041
That's bad. That was bad, okay?

929
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:14,541
Come on.

930
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:16,791
Come on.

931
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:20,250
You almost got me. It's not good.

932
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:24,291
I'm gonna have to kill you now, Jen.

933
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,915
No, you'll never get away with it.

934
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:27,875
They'll take you to jail.

935
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:31,374
Please, please. If you
leave, I won't say anything.

936
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,707
No, no, okay?

937
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:34,832
I'm just gonna make it
as if Gerry killed you,

938
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:36,333
and then he killed himself.

939
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:40,125
Think of it. There's a
heap of reasons from guilt.

940
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:43,791
Yeah. Just think of all the reasons why.

941
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:48,040
He loved you, but you
didn't love him back,

942
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:51,165
so there's motive right there.

943
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:52,666
No. No.
Yeah.

944
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:57,040
Oh, Gerry's dead.

945
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:58,125
What?

946
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:01,415
I killed him.
No! No!

947
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:02,375
Does it make you sad?

948
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:03,874
Does it make you sad?
No!

949
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,874
Does it make you sad that
the love of your life is gone?

950
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:08,500
You're mad, huh?

951
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,999
Oh, you're mad, you're mad, you're mad!

952
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,457
You're just so mean, huh? You're mad!

953
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:13,458
You're raging!

954
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,457
What does your psychology
classes say about that, huh?

955
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:20,332
You're gonna befriend me,
get my trust, and then what?

956
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:22,499
You're gonna hurt me? No,
that's bad teaching, Jen.

957
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,832
I don't think you're gonna be
a good psychologist anymore.

958
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:27,290
I hate you!
Oh, come on. That's weak!

959
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:29,582
You're insane!
It's a diagnosis.

960
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:31,790
It's a diagnosis. I've had
that a few times, you know.

961
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:34,499
You know, I was in the inpatient,

962
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,915
one of those psych wards
for the criminally insane,

963
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:39,082
and they said that I had the hypomania,

964
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:41,207
tendency to have psychotic episodes.

965
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:43,499
Do you think this is a
psychotic episode, Jen?

966
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,833
Do you think so? Speak to me!

967
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:51,582
I don't know what you would call that!

968
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,416
You know what? Don't speak to me.

969
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,625
Shut up!

970
01:17:56,041 --> 01:17:57,041
Shut up.

971
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:05,665
Excuse me, all right? I'm
gonna craft a suicide note.

972
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:06,916
How do you think it goes?

973
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:13,041
Dear Jen, this is all your
fault, all your fault.

974
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,249
I like it. I think it starts off nicely.

975
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,125
I think that's right, okay?

976
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:24,916
You said we could be together
forever, but you lied to me.

977
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:27,915
Similar. You lied to me.

978
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:31,708
So I had to find a way for
us to be together forever,

979
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,457
and I found it.

980
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:38,290
And this way we can both
be in the same place,

981
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:39,707
a better place.

982
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:43,416
I love you all the world. Love from Gerry.

983
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,957
It's kind of poetic,
right? It's kind of poetic.

984
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:53,665
I like it, I like it. But
how's he gonna kill you?

985
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:54,791
Does he stab you?

986
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:59,708
Does he choke you? Does he shoot you?

987
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:02,416
I don't know.

988
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:05,874
He could bludgeon you, hit you,

989
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,791
stab you, slit your
throat, break your neck.

990
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:14,000
Just ask. How do you wanna go?

991
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,583
Jen!

992
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:35,583
Why are you being so difficult?

993
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:41,290
This love affair is over, okay?

994
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:43,250
Now I've just gotta clean up this mess.

995
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,583
Okay, let's do this.

996
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,958
Looks like slit throat it is.

997
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,000
Huh? Huh?

998
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:09,041
Slit throat it is. You're right.

999
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,541
911. What's your emergency?

1000
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:33,250
Can you just come as soon
as you can? It's a long story.

1001
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,541
What is your address?

1002
01:21:37,166 --> 01:21:42,166
5542 Sycamore Lane.
Please, hurry.

1003
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:48,250
And as your therapist, I'll
always be here to listen.

1004
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:50,874
I know life can get you down some times,

1005
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:53,540
and people can make you
feel bad about yourself

1006
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,457
and do all sorts of crazy stuff.

1007
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:59,332
But no with courage and strength,

1008
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:02,207
life can be a wonderful experience.

1009
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,749
And listen, there's always
gonna be bad people out there,

1010
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,624
of course, but guess what?

1011
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:10,040
There's good people too are
filled with light and love

1012
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:14,958
and joy and who really want
the best for you, I promise.

1013
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,874
You're gonna be just fine, okay?

1014
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:20,707
And I so look forward to working with you.

1015
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:22,125
