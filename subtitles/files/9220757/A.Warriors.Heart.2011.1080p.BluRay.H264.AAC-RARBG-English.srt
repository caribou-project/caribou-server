1
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:24,494
This is a story
about the guy I fell for.

2
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:26,797
But to really
understand why,

3
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:30,702
You have to know
a little bit about
the game he loves.

4
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:36,674
The game has been played
by native Americans

5
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,309
For centuries.

6
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:40,544
It requires speed
and agility,

7
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,647
Teamwork, strategy,

8
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:45,216
And a bit of violence.

9
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:52,022
You may know it
as lacrosse,

10
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:54,490
But native Americans
know it as baaga'adowe...

11
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,359
The little brother of war.

12
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:57,929
Their matches took days

13
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:00,064
And were played
over Miles of terrain.

14
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:03,867
The winners got land,
wives, and sometimes glory.

15
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:11,475
There's a lot
that's different
about the game now.

16
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:14,378
But the thing
a player needs most
hasn't changed at all.

17
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:16,780
And if you find
someone who has it,

18
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,751
I'd tell you
to never let go.

19
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,146
Get it over there!
Center it!

20
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:52,582
Swing it!
Watch his pass!

21
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,402
Who's Jimmy's back-up?
Hanson.

22
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,240
We're in trouble.

23
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,581
Hey, coach says he's
having second thoughts.

24
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:27,952
*

25
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,189
You ready for this?

26
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:33,957
I was born ready,
bro.

27
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,727
Whoa.

28
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,231
A moment with
my player, ref?

29
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,900
Hansen's the backup,
and I don't want to
hear any arguments.

30
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,501
I thought I was getting
a second chance.

31
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,171
You're arguing.

32
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:49,039
There's a delay of game
penalty with your name on it

33
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:51,809
If I don't get
a resolution A.S.A.P.

34
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,778
I can win this.

35
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:55,713
What's it gonna be,
coach?

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,756
We'll run a switchblade
first, coach says.

37
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,322
Yeah, sure.

38
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,826
I mean it, man...
Switchblade!

39
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,227
Trying to win the
game by yourself.

40
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:12,797
My play is called
"the iceman".

41
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:16,433
I'm not talking
about your play.

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,002
Do it... switchblade.

43
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:20,872
Bring us all in.

44
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,239
You got no time
for one shot,

45
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,808
And I know wherever
you're going.

46
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,643
15 seconds?
All I need is 10.

47
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:32,850
All right, go! Go! Go!

48
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,589
Come on, Conor!
Switchblade!

49
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,691
Run switchblade!

50
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,361
Conor, pass! Sullivan,
that's not switchblade!

51
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,280
Good job out there.
Good job out there.

52
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,952
Hey, Riggins.

53
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:42,887
Hey, did that go in?
I didn't see.

54
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:45,021
Conor, man, let it go.

55
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:47,223
Come on, fighting
means suspension.

56
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,361
That was wonderful.
Yeah, nice, man.

57
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:53,263
You should call
your father.

58
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,499
The only time
he won't pick up

59
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:56,800
Is when he's
on patrol.

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,334
He's okay.

61
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,937
Dad calls that
"being in the shit".

62
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:01,404
Hey, Keegan!
Top-key mushrooms.

63
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:02,906
Maybe he didn't
pick up

64
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:04,375
Because his phone
is turned off.

65
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,643
Or maybe dad flew back
early from Iraq

66
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,312
To surprise his family.

67
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,315
Dad, you're home!
Ha ha ha!

68
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:14,418
You're looking
rather dashing,
colonel Sullivan.

69
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,452
As are you,
Mrs. Sullivan.

70
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,754
Perhaps I could escort you
home after this.

71
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:20,491
Perhaps you should.

72
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:22,359
Heh!
Aww.

73
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:24,227
Perhaps I could
escort you home
right now.

74
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:25,829
Easy, marine.
Get a room.

75
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:27,263
Ahh.

76
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,900
So, how come
you're home?

77
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,367
I'm wondering
the same thing.

78
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,336
Can't a guy just
slip away from the war

79
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,238
Without his family
thinking something's up?

80
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:36,672
No.

81
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,044
I got some news.

82
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,025
I'll be right back.

83
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,860
Where are you going?

84
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,162
30 minutes, Conor.

85
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,500
I can win this.

86
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:06,103
Other than the fact
that you let 14 get
inside your head,

87
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,372
I thought you were
ten tons of awesome.

88
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,973
Why are we
doing this, dad?
You know why.

89
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,574
We're gonna
move again.

90
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:12,977
Then they'll
call you back,

91
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:14,611
And it'll all
be for what?

92
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,380
Sorry, pal, that's
the military life.

93
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:19,582
Sometimes you gotta
just suck it up, son.

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,855
Conor... It's
very important

95
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:02,459
That you tone your
attitude down here
on and off the field.

96
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:05,162
I had to pull some
strings to get you
in here.

97
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,666
I want you to promise me
that you'll show humility.

98
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,807
Conor, you listening
to me?

99
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,641
Not really, dad.

100
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,217
Come on.

101
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,162
He's really cute.

102
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:41,331
It's funny
what you notice

103
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,034
The first time
you see someone...

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,935
Confidence, a nice smile,

105
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,937
A little connection.

106
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,640
What you don't see...

107
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:52,009
What's impossible to know
at first glance...

108
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,078
Is everything else.

109
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,613
At least everything
that counts.

110
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,722
Hey, dad, how many
of those are yours?

111
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,458
That one.

112
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,496
And my name
is on that one.

113
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:16,699
And that was taken
right after the state
championship.

114
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,701
How many of those
did you win?

115
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,037
Four in a row.
Four?

116
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:22,438
Heh heh.
All right.

117
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:24,840
Hey, who's that
one guy you always...

118
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,510
Dave Milligan.

119
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,944
You're about
to meet him.

120
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:34,450
Straighten your tie.

121
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,986
He played on
one of the best
west coast teams ever.

122
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,556
The kid scored
70 goals last year.

123
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:41,391
Look, nobody
plays varsity
their first year.

124
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:43,094
I can't bench somebody
who's paid their dues.

125
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,695
It wouldn't be fair.

126
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,064
Since when are you
a stickler for propriety?

127
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,166
Why'd you
bring him here?

128
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,000
Because, despite our
considerable differences,

129
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,536
I know your reputation
as a coach,

130
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:54,270
And you turn out
a hell of a lacrosse player.

131
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:59,410
We play real lacrosse
here, not that west
coast field hockey.

132
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,477
Just play him,
see how he does.

133
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,713
I'm not asking
for favors.

134
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,617
I'm doing you
a favor just by
giving him a look,

135
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:10,887
And right now,
that's all I can
give you.

136
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:12,755
Fair enough.

137
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,724
Can I help you?

138
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,727
Thanks,
but I'm pretty good
at dressing myself.

139
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,329
No, varsity only here.
Scrubs dress in there.

140
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,969
So, you're what passes
as varsity around here?

141
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,937
Yeah.

142
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:03,740
Heh. Awesome.

143
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,463
Yo, skip,
toss me a ball.

144
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,500
Watch the ball.
Sticks up, sticks up.

145
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,102
Watch that throw.
Watch the ball!

146
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,070
Let's go!

147
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:36,773
Great, guys.
Keep the pace up.

148
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,609
Stay focused.
Really well done.

149
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,477
Good, keep
the ball moving.

150
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,849
Oh, you're late,
west coast.
It's 4:00.

151
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,185
If you're not early,
you're late.
You owe me a lap.

152
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,187
Let's go,
cradle it out.

153
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:52,388
Sticks up. Keep your
feet moving.

154
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:55,259
Nice. Nicely done.
Watch the ball.

155
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:57,160
Get the energy up.
Sticks up.

156
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,595
You okay?

157
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,166
Cradle it out.
Sticks up.

158
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:14,877
Sticks up! Sticks up!

159
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,448
Come on,
you can take him!

160
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,589
You think you can
do better, Sullivan?

161
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:28,792
Only one way
to find out.

162
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,294
Switch up your Jersey
to white.

163
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,862
Coach,
give me a whistle.

164
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,264
You got it, coach.

165
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,301
Braveheart, give me
Bryant! Let's go

166
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:44,207
Bryant, Sullivan,
let's go!

167
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:48,912
Anytime today, Sullivan!
Here we go!

168
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,213
Joe's gonna crush you.

169
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,947
One-on-one,
go on my whistle.

170
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:55,252
First one to score wins.
It's that simple. Got it?

171
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,220
Down. Keep it clean.

172
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,090
Good luck, brother.
I'm not your brother.

173
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,025
Oh, we're all brothers
in lacrosse, west coast.

174
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,068
Come on!
Come on, west coast!

175
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:18,342
No, no, no, no!

176
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,009
Hey!

177
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,076
Yeah!

178
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:28,352
You should've
shot when you
had the chance.

179
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,887
Yeah, I guess so.

180
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:33,357
Welcome to Briarfield,
Sullivan.

181
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,305
Conor.

182
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,373
Conor.

183
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,343
Hey, come on, wake up.

184
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,143
Dad? Is the house
on fire?

185
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,678
No, it's morning.

186
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,617
No, it isn't.

187
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,921
It's close enough.
Let's go.

188
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:15,264
Not bad, not bad.

189
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,569
Hang on a sec.
I gotta take this call.

190
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:25,240
Sullivan.

191
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:26,942
Morning, general.

192
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:30,447
Yes, sir.

193
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,019
Right. Okay.

194
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:39,590
Thank you, sir.

195
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,995
What was that about?
Nothing.

196
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,365
Just some advisory work
they want me to do.

197
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:49,966
That it?
Yeah, that's it.

198
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't worry about it.

199
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,003
Let's go.

200
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:57,340
Okay.

201
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,310
Keep your arms
extended, this side.

202
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:02,178
Let's see
what you got. Go.

203
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:05,948
Oh, nice, nice.

204
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,951
Except you gotta
learn how to shoot.

205
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,422
Who's gonna pick up
a guy who shoots
like a drunk woman?

206
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,022
Huh? Come on.

207
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:14,490
*

208
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,030
There are a bunch of ways
to find out about someone.

209
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:22,165
You can watch them
around other people,

210
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,468
Find out what
their interests are,

211
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,636
How they react
to new circumstances.

212
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,804
Sometimes, if you
really want to know,

213
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:31,206
It's easiest to just
talk to them yourself.

214
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:33,242
Hey.
Hey.

215
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,145
Hey yourself,
newbie.

216
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,613
Name's Conor Sullivan.

217
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,051
Brooklyn...

218
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:42,553
Milligan.

219
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,155
Ahem.

220
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:49,191
Coach's daughter. Ahem.

221
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,529
So, my dad says
you come out here

222
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:54,229
To practice
every day at 5 A.M.

223
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:55,765
Oh, does he?
He does.

224
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:59,369
Does that make you wonder
how your dad knows that?

225
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:01,070
Because it sure
makes me wonder.

226
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:03,573
Hey, Joe, think fast!

227
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,108
Ha ha! Hey, babe.

228
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:07,577
Hey.

229
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,111
Hey, this is
my girlfriend Charlie.

230
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:10,380
Hey.
Hey.

231
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,047
Um...

232
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,116
We should probably
get back to practice.

233
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,418
Yeah.

234
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:17,521
See you later.
Bye.

235
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:20,122
See you later.
See you later.

236
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:25,228
Nothing's hotter than
chicks with sticks.

237
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:26,429
Nothing.

238
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:27,931
Just doesn't sound right.

239
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:29,600
I didn't mean it
that way.

240
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:46,849
Gotta watch the pick!

241
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,818
Ohh.

242
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,322
This kid can play.

243
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:54,890
He most definitely
can play.

244
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,027
So, what do you think?
You want to move him up?

245
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:58,929
We'll see where he is
in a week.

246
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
Hey.

247
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,805
Nice practice.
Thanks.

248
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:13,544
You're not
taking my spot.

249
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,444
Do you play
right-side attack?

250
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:16,946
Damn straight.

251
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:20,950
Then I'm definitely
taking your spot.

252
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:24,887
Let it go.

253
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:32,728
Ahh.

254
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,604
You wanted to see me?

255
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:47,277
Yeah, take a seat.

256
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:50,479
So, uh, you've been
practicing with us...

257
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,616
For, what,
about a week now?

258
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:55,317
What do you think?

259
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,419
Uh...

260
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:00,023
Well, I think you've
got a good system
going on...

261
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,257
Thanks, kid,
but I don't need you
to kiss my butt.

262
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm asking if you can
play with them.

263
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:06,429
Not a one-man dance
out there,

264
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:09,099
But actually working
with them as a unit.

265
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:11,501
I thought you weren't
gonna play me.

266
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,235
Well, that may change.

267
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:14,905
May?
May.

268
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,505
You're not the God's gift
you think you are,

269
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:17,973
But you're better
than I expected.

270
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,546
Yes... I can play
with them.

271
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,281
Good. You'll suit up
on Friday.

272
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:28,317
It's our last game
before the playoffs.

273
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:31,353
Impress me.

274
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:37,661
Why isn't he
playing Conor?

275
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:39,428
Relax, he knows
what he's doing.

276
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,931
I don't think Dave's
gonna give him a fair shot.

277
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:45,568
You know
us Sullivans, huh?

278
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,369
We always a way
to get it done.

279
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,707
Move your feet!

280
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:53,576
Let's have some
pressure, defense!

281
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,382
All right, Dupree out!

282
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,551
Sullivan!

283
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,955
Eh-eh.

284
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,657
Remember what
I told you?

285
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:10,060
You got it?
Got it, coach.

286
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,328
Okay,
here we go.

287
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,929
It's about time.

288
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,832
He just wanted to show
Conor who's boss.

289
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,566
You think that taught
Conor anything?

290
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:18,769
Heh! Doubt it.

291
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,882
Let's go, baby!
Nice goin'!

292
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:35,786
You gotta get your body
between the ball
and the goal, son.

293
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,519
What is this,
girls' volleyball?

294
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:41,523
Good scrimmage!
First team, come off!

295
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,259
I'll be right back.

296
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,594
Nice job,
first team, good work.

297
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:48,832
Good work today. Nice.

298
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:53,068
Good effort.
Let's go, second team!

299
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,604
Let's see some pressure,
let's hear some talk!

300
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,640
That's what I'm talk...
come on, let's hear
some talk!

301
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,611
Come on, let's go!
Keep it moving!

302
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,347
Keep that ball high!

303
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,394
End of the day.
Hit the showers.

304
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,629
Good work today.

305
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:23,166
Good work today,
everybody.

306
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,777
You didn't
have to wait.

307
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,545
Well, I think
we should talk.

308
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,681
All right.

309
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:45,822
So, who was that
on the phone?

310
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,729
They need me
back in Iraq.

311
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:57,566
Well,
mom needs you here.

312
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,869
So does Keegan.

313
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:04,074
Under six months.
That's it.

314
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,141
That's just
another surge.

315
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,377
We could've just
stayed in California.

316
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:10,345
At least then
I'd have some friends
to hang out with...

317
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:16,086
I know it wasn't
part of the plan.

318
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:19,488
Then this is where
you need to be.

319
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,457
This is your future.

320
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:24,460
Six months.

321
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:30,532
Come on.

322
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,369
*

323
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:46,249
Conor?

324
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:48,583
I've got something
for you.

325
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,718
What is it?

326
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:51,686
A box of roses.

327
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:54,156
Just open it.

328
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,363
That's what you said
they called you, right?

329
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,265
Captain America?

330
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:07,237
Hope you score
a lot of goals
with that, son.

331
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:10,273
But it's important
how you score.

332
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,542
Never put yourself
above the game.

333
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,614
Now, give your
old man a hug.

334
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:21,784
Come on.

335
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:31,660
I'll have my
right hand shot down
when you get back.

336
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,528
Can't wait.

337
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:37,199
Keep your head down
over there.

338
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:40,035
You just keep your
head up over here.

339
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:39,294
*

340
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,519
He's here.

341
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:12,527
You're late,
west coast.

342
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:15,597
Late to my own practice
that you're intruding on.

343
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:16,967
Intruding, huh?

344
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:18,901
We could leave.

345
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:21,870
You can stay.

346
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:24,539
My work here is done.

347
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,778
At least try
to play hard-to-get.

348
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:30,446
Shut up.

349
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,750
You ready?

350
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:38,588
Let's do it.

351
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,568
You okay?

352
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:56,171
Yeah. Fine.

353
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,417
I can't shoot
with this thing.

354
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:09,651
Shooting strings
are a mess.

355
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:12,022
Ahh.

356
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:15,058
Much better.

357
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,659
Maybe if you didn't
shoot so hard.

358
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,670
I heard
about your dad.

359
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:31,806
Yeah?

360
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:33,942
How long
is he gone for?

361
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,612
Six months.
Hmm.

362
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:53,462
Same time tomorrow?

363
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:57,799
Well, I'd hate
to intrude.

364
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:05,641
Uhh!

365
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:08,978
Morning.

366
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:14,016
It's fine.

367
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,052
When your daughter
leaves the house
before dawn,

368
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,652
It's not spying,
it's parenting.

369
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:20,455
I'm not sure
it's a good idea

370
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,157
To hang around
that Sullivan kid,
though.

371
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:25,794
Dad, I barely
even know him.

372
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,297
Right.

373
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,969
Everybody gather up!

374
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:37,005
Whole team, gather!
Let's go!

375
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:39,809
Everyone, bring it in!

376
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,311
I've just been informed

377
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,246
That Briarfield has been
selected as the location

378
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:47,183
For the first ever east-west
championship game.

379
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,684
Gentlemen,
it is my intention

380
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,720
That we're not only
hosting that game,

381
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,787
But we're playing in it.

382
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:55,890
Hands in, men.
Warriors on three.

383
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,060
One, two, three.

384
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,495
Warriors!

385
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:01,963
Let's go out
and show 'em who we are!

386
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:04,434
Come on!

387
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:31,161
Sullivan, get in there
for Dupree.

388
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:37,233
Uhh!
Uhh!

389
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,323
Bounce back up.
Let's go.

390
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,096
We got number 9...
unsportsmanlike
conduct.

391
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:08,531
Two minutes.

392
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,766
That was a stupid play.

393
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,171
He pushed me,
I pushed back.

394
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:17,807
Come on Briarfield!
Man down!

395
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,642
Let's go!

396
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:53,943
Nice game, Conor.

397
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,278
Except for the penalty.

398
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:57,011
Dad would've been proud.

399
00:27:57,078 --> 00:27:58,180
Thanks, mom.

400
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,615
There's some mail
for you.

401
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:06,088
What is it?

402
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:11,694
Dad signed me up
for some old-school
lacrosse camp.

403
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,696
Looks good,
doesn't it?

404
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:16,366
Run by native American
players.

405
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:19,269
Your dad used to
love it up there.

406
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,043
"Ha ha, dad.
Indian lacrosse camp.

407
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,847
Hooray east coast."

408
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,722
Your dad knows
how to text?

409
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:42,624
Uh, yeah.
He said he made
his private show him.

410
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:57,239
* then we went up

411
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:59,308
* we are much older

412
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,411
* you wait like an angel

413
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:05,080
* and I pine
like a soldier *

414
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:08,150
* but I remember love

415
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:11,754
* love don't remember me

416
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,392
* it's been a long

417
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:20,228
* long time

418
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:23,164
* since I've been on

419
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:26,167
* your mind

420
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,403
* but I cannot

421
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,239
* decline

422
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:34,276
* anything for you

423
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:40,483
* I'll drink the whiskey

424
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,453
* you'll drink
gin and tonic *

425
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:46,288
* you got
much more strong *

426
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:48,690
* I got more neurotic

427
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:51,494
* but I remember love

428
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:55,530
* but love
don't remember me *

429
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:25,395
* now that I've been
replaced *

430
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,500
* I have the guts
to face *

431
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,340
Thank you
for coming.

432
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:41,977
Is it cold in here?

433
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,758
Hey. With all
due respect, son,

434
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,360
I think your mom
needs you here.

435
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,431
I can't stay.
I just can't.

436
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:04,032
A warrior doesn't
run from pain.

437
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:07,301
Do the right thing
by your family

438
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,104
And stick around.

439
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:12,407
I'm sorry,
but I just really need
to get out of here.

440
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:58,420
Hey, you mind
if I, um...

441
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,210
I'm...

442
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,579
I'm so...

443
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:35,124
It's okay.

444
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,159
I'm so sorry.

445
00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:45,501
I can't go back
in there right now.

446
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,475
Let's...

447
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:55,777
Let's get out of here.

448
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:58,480
Okay?

449
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,850
I'll drive.

450
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:04,186
Yeah.

451
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,827
Arms extended.

452
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,647
Are you better?

453
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:33,716
A little.

454
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:39,521
As good as I can be.

455
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,498
Hey, Brookie.

456
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:53,035
Come on,
we gotta go.

457
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,442
See you tomorrow?

458
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,012
You know the time.

459
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:21,363
I thought I asked you
to stay away from him.

460
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,632
What is your problem?

461
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,233
He just buried
his dad.

462
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:25,935
He's not real stable
right now.

463
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,604
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

464
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,013
*

465
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:10,680
Uhh!

466
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:12,447
What was that?
What?

467
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:14,382
What was that?

468
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,722
Hey! Hey!

469
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:21,389
Settle down!
Settle down!

470
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,658
Dupree, you're done.
Back off, back off.

471
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,392
Sullivan, get out.

472
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,429
Go, go.

473
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:28,664
Get out of here.

474
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:30,064
Let's go, everybody
back to work.

475
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:32,366
Come on. Get back
to your stations.

476
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,336
Let's go.

477
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:47,115
Is this
about what happened?

478
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,151
Believe me,
it's not about that.

479
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:51,286
I have
a responsibility to...

480
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:53,988
Hello, Conor.

481
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:56,225
Coach.

482
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,660
I was just talking
with your mother

483
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,696
About whether
to let you play again.

484
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:06,868
It's been a month
since...

485
00:36:08,537 --> 00:36:10,740
I thought you'd be
a little less
hotheaded by now,

486
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,508
But after today, I...

487
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,309
I need this.

488
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:19,313
Otherwise, I can't play
at the naval academy.

489
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,785
I know. But I need you
to be a player,
not a liability.

490
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:24,253
I'm trying to get
this team

491
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:25,653
In the national
championship game.

492
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:27,489
We could use you.

493
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:28,823
But if you fight again,

494
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,327
That's it...
You are off my team.

495
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:35,930
So, what you're
saying is,

496
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,400
I have to let them
beat on me
and just take it?

497
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:41,035
If you want to come back
as a player, you're welcome.

498
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:43,437
Otherwise,
don't come back at all.

499
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,808
But what you're doing
out there now

500
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,343
Is not lacrosse.

501
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:52,347
You think
you know someone.

502
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:54,548
You have
a nice connection.

503
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:56,786
But before they can
let you in,

504
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:58,353
They've got to
let themselves in.

505
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,090
They have to learn
their own heart.

506
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:03,457
Come on,
you're gonna be late.

507
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,828
Come on,
you said yourself
you needed to play.

508
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:08,662
Don't waste
this opportunity.

509
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,499
I'm not going.
You've been given
a second chance.

510
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,434
Just leave me alone.

511
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,636
Honey, I know
this is hard for you.

512
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,272
Do you?!

513
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,484
Come on.
You need to
suck it up, mom.

514
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:34,389
That's what this is?
You're sucking it up?

515
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:36,325
Since you've got
it all figured out,

516
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,192
Why don't you
step up and be a man?

517
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,228
Get yourself
to school on time.

518
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:42,096
Maybe you can spend
a little time
with Keegan.

519
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:44,665
Because you know what?
He's not sucking it up.

520
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:46,902
He's gotta learn.

521
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,819
Hey.

522
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:06,821
Hey.

523
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,690
Where were you
this morning?

524
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:10,892
I was up late.

525
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,427
Okay.

526
00:38:13,494 --> 00:38:16,697
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

527
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:22,736
What's the point?

528
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:24,939
You know your dad's
never liked me.

529
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:27,376
Doesn't even want you
around me.

530
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:29,311
Oh, come on.
We both know

531
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:31,981
My dad cares more
about winning the
championship game.

532
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:35,350
But it isn't enough
to be good, Conor.

533
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:38,820
Maybe if you were
more of a team player,

534
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:40,822
He would find a way
to use you.

535
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,258
Wow. So, you're
taking his side now?

536
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:46,095
Are you serious
right now?

537
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,331
I have been on your
side since day one.

538
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:53,167
Frankly,
I don't know what
your side is anymore.

539
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:15,224
Sullivan, Douglas
is banged up.

540
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,027
Get in there.
Left side attack. Yes.

541
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:19,895
All right,
Briarfield, let's go!

542
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,695
Come on!

543
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:22,965
Hey, Sullivan!

544
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:25,066
How you liking
that left side?

545
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:54,563
Here, here, here!

546
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:57,599
Come on!
Come on!

547
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:05,206
Ref, come on!

548
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:23,824
Conor, no!

549
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:27,628
You're done.
Get out of my sight.

550
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,011
You all right?

551
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:50,585
*

552
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,106
What is wrong with you?

553
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:46,740
Hey! Stop right there!

554
00:41:54,482 --> 00:41:58,153
Heck of a way
to start spring break.

555
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,788
Any idea who
might've done this?

556
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:04,992
Um, it all happened
so fast.

557
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,661
I didn't...

558
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:25,280
* in the light of the sun

559
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,683
* is there anyone?

560
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,256
* oh, it has begun

561
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:36,790
* oh, dear,
you look so lost... *

562
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,693
No.

563
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:42,831
* your eyes are red,
your tears are shed *

564
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,768
* this world you must
have crossed, you said *

565
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:49,171
* you don't know me

566
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:54,942
* and you don't even care

567
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:57,945
* oh, yeah

568
00:42:58,011 --> 00:42:59,080
* you said

569
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,184
* you don't know me

570
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,956
* and you don't
wear my chains *

571
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:10,791
* oh, yeah

572
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:16,730
Conor.

573
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,232
I'm going to bed.

574
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:20,602
You're not going
anywhere, Conor Sullivan.

575
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:23,638
* essential, yet appealed

576
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:28,843
* you carry
all your thoughts *

577
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,215
* across an open field

578
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:37,186
* where flowers gaze at you

579
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:41,723
* they're not the only ones

580
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,126
* who cry when they see you,
you said *

581
00:43:45,194 --> 00:43:48,061
* you don't know me

582
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:52,267
* and you don't even care

583
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:56,937
* no, no, no,

584
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:58,773
Sullivan!

585
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:03,111
He doesn't deserve
that name.

586
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:05,980
The kid has no idea.

587
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:08,249
You wear glasses?

588
00:44:08,316 --> 00:44:09,951
No.

589
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:11,252
Any prescription
medication

590
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:12,853
I need to know of?

591
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,255
What? No.

592
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:15,824
Do you have
a cell phone?

593
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,726
No.

594
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,829
From this point on,
you do not speak
unless spoken to.

595
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:23,130
Am I clear?

596
00:44:23,198 --> 00:44:25,033
You're coming with me.

597
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:27,801
Like hell I am.

598
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:31,572
Fine. Spend another
night in jail.

599
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Okay, okay.

600
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:39,248
So, where are we going?

601
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:40,949
The six nations
work camp.

602
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,784
It's where we send
all the reservation kids

603
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,819
Who can't get
their life together...

604
00:44:44,886 --> 00:44:46,855
Kids like you.

605
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,390
Work camp?

606
00:44:48,457 --> 00:45:13,314
Like picking up
litter and shit?

607
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,517
Get out.

608
00:45:28,263 --> 00:45:29,997
Court papers?

609
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,866
Didn't get that far.

610
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:36,237
Weapons?

611
00:45:37,406 --> 00:45:39,072
Drugs?

612
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,108
Pornography?

613
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:43,278
What? No.

614
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:48,883
I'm gonna frisk you
just the same.

615
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,585
And this will turn
into a court case
if you're lying.

616
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,289
Hands on the counter.

617
00:45:55,324 --> 00:45:57,190
Spread your feet.

618
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:59,260
And your cheeks.

619
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,370
Sit.

620
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:11,239
I'll grab
your counselor.

621
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:14,008
I am
his counselor.

622
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:15,543
Yeah?

623
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,780
Okay.

624
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:22,115
Missionary Ridge.

625
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:24,117
Think you can find
your way back in the dark?

626
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:25,919
Shitfaced and blind.

627
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:42,235
Not that it matters,

628
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:46,841
But would you mind
explaining to me
this whole thing?

629
00:46:46,908 --> 00:46:50,143
Do not speak
unless spoken to.

630
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,813
Well,
where are we going?

631
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,416
What are we
supposed to eat?

632
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:05,493
You gotta be
kidding me.

633
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,604
Jeez!

634
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:21,376
You need to build
a shelter

635
00:47:21,443 --> 00:47:24,145
If you plan on
getting some sleep.

636
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:25,447
It's impossible.

637
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:31,486
Duke! Duke!

638
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:37,324
Duke!

639
00:47:37,392 --> 00:47:39,561
Duke!

640
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:43,432
* If heaven would
fall down from the sky *

641
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:46,667
* and I'd walk right in

642
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:50,203
* I wouldn't know
where to begin, no *

643
00:47:56,445 --> 00:47:59,080
* what did I ever do

644
00:47:59,147 --> 00:48:02,282
* to deserve
to be kicked out? *

645
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,385
* oh, oh

646
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:08,922
* can you remind me?

647
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:11,626
* or can we write
the songs... *

648
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:14,327
Who are you texting?

649
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:17,831
Joe?
Yeah.

650
00:48:17,899 --> 00:48:19,667
Any news
from your felon?

651
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,370
I can't stop
thinking about him.

652
00:48:23,438 --> 00:48:27,909
But how do you
know if someone's
right for you?

653
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:30,779
Obviously, I can't
ask my dad about Conor,

654
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:34,347
And my mom's been gone
for so long.

655
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:36,050
I just don't know.

656
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,553
I guess you just have
to trust yourself,

657
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,556
And if he's right
for you, you'll know it.

658
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,825
Mm-hmm.

659
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:28,301
Hey, home slice.

660
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:31,606
How come you slept
out in the rain
last night?

661
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:33,007
I got a great
shelter here.

662
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:35,208
Why didn't you
come get me?

663
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:38,812
Is it noon yet?

664
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:41,983
I don't know.
Aren't you an Indian?

665
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,118
Can't you look up
at the sun or something?

666
00:49:46,187 --> 00:49:48,990
Well, it's gotta be
noon somewhere.

667
00:49:49,057 --> 00:49:51,458
Well, you'd better
get started.

668
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:53,794
Started on what?

669
00:49:55,428 --> 00:49:58,431
Knocking it down.

670
00:49:58,499 --> 00:49:59,500
Why would I want
to knock down

671
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,535
A perfectly good shed?

672
00:50:01,603 --> 00:50:03,204
Don't you live
in this place?

673
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,105
I've got my reasons.

674
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:08,175
I don't even know how
to use one of those.

675
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:13,915
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

676
00:50:13,982 --> 00:50:17,484
Which is
your chicken-choker?

677
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:20,054
My what?
Answer the question.

678
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:23,991
Are you really
asking me that?

679
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:27,128
You could've
killed me, man!

680
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:28,630
Lefty. Interesting.

681
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:31,199
One hand on the bottom,
one on the top.

682
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,702
Swing over
your shoulder,
extend your arms.

683
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:36,070
You get a lot more
power that way.

684
00:50:38,106 --> 00:50:40,575
This place is
a freakin' mansion.

685
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:42,577
How am I supposed
to knock it all down?

686
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:44,613
Board by board.

687
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:48,549
Board by
ever-loving board.

688
00:50:48,617 --> 00:50:50,918
Am ambidextrous.

689
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:53,254
*

690
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,631
* you feel like a candle

691
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:05,466
* in a hurricane

692
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:07,367
* just like a picture...

693
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:10,503
Be sure to extend
your arm.

694
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:13,141
* alone and helpless

695
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:14,708
* like you've lost
your fight *

696
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:17,544
* but you'll be all right

697
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:20,047
* you'll be all right

698
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:22,617
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

699
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:25,218
* you taste what
you're made of *

700
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:27,721
* you might bend
till you break *

701
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:30,692
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

702
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:32,727
* on your knees,
you look up *

703
00:51:32,794 --> 00:51:35,196
* decide you've
had enough *

704
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:37,766
* you get mad,
you get strong *

705
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:40,567
* wipe your hands,
shake it off *

706
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:42,970
* then you stand

707
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,709
* whoo, ooh

708
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:53,080
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

709
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:55,717
* you taste what
you're made of *

710
00:51:55,784 --> 00:51:58,252
* you might bend
till you break *

711
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,789
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

712
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:03,257
* on your knees,
you look up *

713
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:06,394
* decide you've
had enough... *

714
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:23,678
Get working.

715
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:30,451
I have blisters.

716
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,906
There's gotta be
a purpose.

717
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:59,680
Crazy Indians got me
knocking down
a stupid shed

718
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,452
'cause it represents me
breaking myself down.

719
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:06,520
Yeah.

720
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:09,690
So stupid.

721
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:14,495
Why am I doing this?

722
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:17,732
You tell me.
You're the one
who screwed up.

723
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:21,168
When do I get
to go home?

724
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:22,836
When you learn
your lesson.

725
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:24,604
When's that
gonna be?

726
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:28,475
When I'm finished
knocking down your
palace here?

727
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,746
Kid, there's dozens of
buildings just like this

728
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:33,782
Waiting for you
and that sledgehammer.

729
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,084
What, Sully's
little boy

730
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,519
Want to come out here
and take a swing?

731
00:53:39,586 --> 00:53:40,889
Temper is good.

732
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,857
It's how you use it
that matters.

733
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:45,860
When you fight,
you quit. Right?

734
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:48,830
In life, in lacrosse...
You know you failed.

735
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:50,663
You know you're not
gonna win.

736
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:54,101
So, you throw a punch.
And you quit.

737
00:53:55,403 --> 00:53:59,407
Get back to work,
you little jerk-off.

738
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,687
Is it 12:00 yet?

739
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:17,724
Crazy Indian.

740
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,893
Where's your sundial?

741
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,462
Save it.

742
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,833
You work,
I'll talk.

743
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:31,404
You know,
I'm a full-blooded
Iroquois.

744
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:35,276
This may sound
antiquated to you,

745
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:39,246
But the Iroquois
banded with five
other tribes

746
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:41,415
To form
the six nations...

747
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:43,818
A participatory
democracy

748
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:45,820
That lasts
to this day.

749
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:49,122
I have no idea what
any of that means.

750
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:52,994
A participatory
democracy

751
00:54:53,061 --> 00:54:56,297
Means that my people
got the vote

752
00:54:56,364 --> 00:54:59,400
100 years before
Thomas Jefferson

753
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:03,171
Decided all men
were created equal.

754
00:55:04,805 --> 00:55:06,440
So?

755
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:08,709
So, you couldn't be
more authentically

756
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:11,179
And originally American
than that.

757
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:16,550
So, the next time
you call me
a crazy Indian,

758
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:21,322
I will personally
tattoo those words
to your forehead.

759
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:29,363
Do I have to
remind you again?

760
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,867
Do not speak unless
you're spoken to!

761
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:35,536
I was talking
to myself.

762
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:37,204
What?

763
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,239
I'm pretty sure
this is illegal.

764
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:42,877
So is destroying
a trophy case.

765
00:55:44,711 --> 00:55:46,380
Now, work!

766
00:56:42,702 --> 00:56:44,737
Heh.

767
00:56:44,804 --> 00:56:47,774
Permission to speak.

768
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,710
Define "warrior".

769
00:56:50,777 --> 00:56:54,714
Someone who spills blood
on the field of battle.

770
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,985
What about...
I know what
you're gonna say.

771
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:58,686
But don't waste
your breath asking.

772
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,622
Turf burns do not now
and never will count

773
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,257
As spilling blood.

774
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:06,427
I'm sure your dad
taught you all this.

775
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:10,030
My dad was never
really around
to teach me much.

776
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:13,700
Well, that's
too bad for you.

777
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:17,070
'Cause my colonel
was there for me
in a big way.

778
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:20,441
Let me tell you
a story.

779
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:24,911
I left the F.O.B.
In a re-supply convoy

780
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:27,448
To the other side
of Fallujah.

781
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:29,984
You know what
we were carrying?
Ammo?

782
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:31,718
Energy drinks.

783
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:34,055
Gatorade and red bull.

784
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:37,324
The bare necessities,
right?

785
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,361
Then, all of a sudden,
we come to a traffic jam.

786
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:47,535
Before I know it,
I'm hit.

787
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,936
And the corpsman
takes one in the head

788
00:57:50,004 --> 00:57:53,607
As he runs to save me.

789
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:56,744
And, I mean...

790
00:57:56,809 --> 00:57:58,411
We can't move.

791
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:01,748
All of a sudden,
we're surrounded.

792
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:03,684
End of story.

793
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:08,856
Then your dad just
comes out of nowhere,

794
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:11,359
Like the cavalry.

795
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:13,626
You know what
he says to me?

796
00:58:15,695 --> 00:58:17,697
"I'll never drink
another Gatorade

797
00:58:17,764 --> 00:58:19,500
As long as I live."

798
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:24,805
And somehow he gets
the medevac.

799
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:27,274
He gets me out.

800
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:33,647
He gets everybody out.

801
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:37,450
I never knew a warrior
better than him.

802
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:59,107
Well,
you're up early.

803
00:58:59,173 --> 00:59:01,241
Can't sleep.

804
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:03,744
I could swear
I'm hearing things.

805
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,978
Well, all right.

806
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:08,315
Let's go find them.

807
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:11,452
Find what?

808
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,154
The noises.

809
00:59:30,503 --> 00:59:32,106
So, that's
what I've been hearing?

810
00:59:39,347 --> 00:59:41,615
Some of those guys
are the counselors

811
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:43,950
From the six nations
lacrosse camp

812
00:59:44,016 --> 00:59:45,186
Your dad signed
you up for.

813
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:47,188
They come down here

814
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:49,190
To play the counselors
from the work camp.

815
00:59:49,257 --> 00:59:51,292
Who are
the other players?

816
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,060
It's just them.
It's real lacrosse.

817
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:56,730
And, brother,
let me tell you... real.

818
00:59:56,797 --> 00:59:59,267
Your dad played here.

819
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:01,202
He was a counselor?

820
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:04,172
Just a camper.
Hand-picked...

821
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:07,741
For his love of
the game was pure.

822
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:21,087
You know,
Milligan played at
this game, too.

823
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:23,590
You didn't know that,
did you?

824
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:26,927
He and your dad
played together at Navy
after that.

825
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:30,130
They were cool until
a woman came between them.

826
01:00:30,198 --> 01:00:32,499
Milligan fell hard
for her.

827
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:35,236
Your dad just
stole her away.

828
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:40,540
My mom?

829
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:44,778
My dad did that?
To a friend?

830
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:49,250
You know, every great man
has a weakness,

831
01:00:49,317 --> 01:00:52,885
And Sully's...
It was Claire.

832
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,791
I'm giving up
lacrosse.

833
01:00:57,858 --> 01:01:01,494
Why? Just because
your old man
wasn't a Saint?

834
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:05,299
You don't get it.

835
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:08,536
Every time
I pick up a stick,

836
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:12,104
Every time I hear
the word "lacrosse",

837
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,374
I think of my dad.

838
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:17,644
You know, if I could
say something...

839
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,582
Let him run
in your veins.

840
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:25,652
Let him
make you better.

841
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:30,323
He was proud of you.

842
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,494
Don't forget that.

843
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:44,338
Let's go.

844
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:51,944
West coast.

845
01:01:53,347 --> 01:01:55,249
Duke,
how you doing, sir?

846
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:56,884
What are you
doing here?

847
01:01:56,949 --> 01:01:58,218
Spring break.

848
01:01:58,286 --> 01:02:00,220
This is where
I learned to play.

849
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,756
Briarfield made
the championship.

850
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:06,560
Good for you guys.
Thanks.

851
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:09,862
Come on,
be on my team.
Let's go.

852
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:17,305
Here we go! Go!

853
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:26,379
All right, guys,
I found a couple more.

854
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:28,282
This game's faster.

855
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:30,216
Looks the same
to me.

856
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:33,620
Heh. Ready?
Game on!

857
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:35,956
Trash talk out here...
You lose a few teeth.

858
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:40,627
Ha ha ha!
You see that?

859
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:42,161
Were you watching
the roll dodge

860
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:43,764
Or were you watching
Joe getting burned?

861
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:45,231
I was watching Joe
get schooled.

862
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:48,035
Iron sharpens iron.

863
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,269
All right?

864
01:02:49,337 --> 01:02:51,638
Joe's getting awfully
sharp today.

865
01:02:54,206 --> 01:02:56,242
Two points down!

866
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:07,054
Go! Go! Go!

867
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:22,370
Go! Go!
Ha ha ha!

868
01:03:25,772 --> 01:03:27,608
Ha!
Yeah!

869
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,319
What the hell, man?

870
01:03:39,387 --> 01:03:40,821
Joe! Joe! Joe!

871
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:44,024
Come on, man!

872
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:48,862
Here we go, here we go.

873
01:03:52,164 --> 01:03:53,666
Really?!

874
01:03:57,471 --> 01:04:00,172
Get off me!

875
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:17,157
Nighty night.

876
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:19,325
Let's go!

877
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,462
Play on. Here we go.

878
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:37,578
It's more than
a game, west coast.

879
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:41,081
When are you
gonna learn that?

880
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:03,302
It's hard to say
if warriors are born

881
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:06,039
Or if they're made
by circumstances.

882
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:09,175
I know everyone faces
hardship in life.

883
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:11,879
It just seems like
some people

884
01:05:11,944 --> 01:05:14,748
Are actually
made stronger by it.

885
01:05:22,523 --> 01:05:24,992
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

886
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:27,995
Sometimes in life,
you just gotta
suck it up, son.

887
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,031
What you're doing
out there now
is not lacrosse.

888
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,366
When I was your age,
I could go for hours.

889
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,069
Think I don't do that?

890
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:37,638
I never see it.

891
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:39,540
What is
wrong with you?!

892
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,476
Why don't you
step up and be a man?

893
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,536
Hey.

894
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:11,070
This place is
starting to bore me.

895
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:13,172
Let's head back.

896
01:06:20,613 --> 01:06:24,617
So, I still
don't get it.

897
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:27,419
Was this supposed
to be a metaphor?

898
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:30,858
Was I knocking down
the walls of my anger?

899
01:06:30,923 --> 01:06:33,193
I mean, what was I
doing up there?

900
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,629
You think too much.

901
01:06:35,696 --> 01:06:38,165
It's a simple
question.

902
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:43,003
How do you feel
right now?

903
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:47,373
Pissed that you
kicked my butt.

904
01:06:47,439 --> 01:06:49,643
Other than that.

905
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:52,646
Honestly?

906
01:06:54,715 --> 01:06:56,382
Confused.

907
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:58,285
It's about time.

908
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,520
What?

909
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,391
I spent a week...

910
01:07:04,456 --> 01:07:07,459
Knocking down
a house...

911
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:10,162
So I could feel
confused?

912
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:14,434
You spent a week
knocking down a house

913
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:16,604
So you could feel
at all.

914
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:30,150
Look, you're
on your own now.

915
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:32,018
I'm not gonna be
able to be there

916
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:33,986
To rein in
that temper

917
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:37,523
Or whisper words
of sweet wisdom
in your ear.

918
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:40,327
You gotta
hold it together.

919
01:07:40,392 --> 01:07:42,428
Can you do that?

920
01:07:42,494 --> 01:07:45,364
Yeah. Sure.

921
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:49,336
Well... That's
a resounding hoorah.

922
01:07:49,401 --> 01:07:52,172
You know, if I was
a betting man...
which I am...

923
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,506
I wouldn't put a single
George Washington

924
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:55,942
On your self-importance.

925
01:07:56,008 --> 01:07:59,511
Ahh...
that's just
the way I am.

926
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:02,348
Now, your old man...

927
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:05,051
He would've probably
done things differently.

928
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:09,657
You asked me for the
definition of a warrior.

929
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,860
A warrior
gets the job done.

930
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:17,229
That's all I got.

931
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:25,405
Now get out
of my truck.

932
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:28,007
Yes, sir.

933
01:08:33,512 --> 01:08:35,248
Hey, kid.

934
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:40,019
For the record,
I'm rooting for you.

935
01:08:41,655 --> 01:08:43,724
Thank you.

936
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,609
Whoa. What's up, buddy?

937
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:04,410
Man, you need
a shower.

938
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:07,047
I try.

939
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:10,984
Mom... Is it okay
if I go see Brooklyn?

940
01:09:14,554 --> 01:09:16,123
Here.

941
01:09:18,557 --> 01:09:20,292
Wish me luck.

942
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,738
Help you?

943
01:10:04,804 --> 01:10:06,539
I'm here
to see Brooklyn.

944
01:10:06,606 --> 01:10:08,208
I'm not so different
from you.

945
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:09,876
You're never playing
for me again.

946
01:10:09,943 --> 01:10:12,311
But I'll play.

947
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:15,615
Anywhere there's
a couple of goals
and a field,

948
01:10:15,682 --> 01:10:17,483
I can find a game.

949
01:10:17,549 --> 01:10:19,252
I'm a lacrosse player.

950
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:22,389
And that's one thing
no one can ever take
away from me.

951
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,098
And, with all
due respect,

952
01:10:31,163 --> 01:10:33,433
Tell Brooklyn
I stopped by.

953
01:10:44,476 --> 01:10:46,112
Hey.

954
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:54,888
*

955
01:10:58,724 --> 01:11:00,760
The heart's
a funny thing.

956
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,265
It can break,
it can beat a little faster.

957
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:08,500
But the most important thing
it can do is heal.

958
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:10,270
And if you follow it,

959
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,939
It'll lead you
where you need to go.

960
01:11:44,571 --> 01:11:46,806
*

961
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:10,563
Get up.

962
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:14,500
Where'd you come from?

963
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:22,943
Oh.

964
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,611
I can do that, too.
Aah! Ha ha!

965
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:26,947
Goal.

966
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:28,680
That was cheating.

967
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,651
All right.

968
01:12:31,718 --> 01:12:33,553
Oh!

969
01:12:37,756 --> 01:12:39,526
Here, take it. Oh!

970
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,085
* will you feel
anything at all? *

971
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:09,989
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

972
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:13,525
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

973
01:13:13,592 --> 01:13:18,431
* will you feel better,
better, better? *

974
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:22,569
* will you feel
anything at all? *

975
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:24,836
* will you feel
anything at all? *

976
01:13:26,538 --> 01:13:32,611
* will you feel
anything at all? *

977
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:34,414
Good, Sullivan.

978
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:39,052
Nice to see you,
east coast.

979
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,054
Nice to be seen,
west coast.

980
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:44,024
Performing
your penance?

981
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,791
How'd you know
I was here?

982
01:13:45,857 --> 01:13:48,160
Word gets out.

983
01:13:49,728 --> 01:13:52,298
If you don't mind,

984
01:13:52,364 --> 01:13:54,233
I invited some friends.

985
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,902
Let's go, guys!

986
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:59,039
Whoa!
There he is!

987
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:00,839
The boys took
a little vote,

988
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:03,943
And we decided
we could use your help
this next game.

989
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:07,580
In case you didn't hear,
we're, uh...

990
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:09,648
We're playing
your old school
for the championship.

991
01:14:09,715 --> 01:14:11,050
Thanks, Dupree.

992
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:13,085
I won't let
you guys down.

993
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:15,221
What's up, boys?

994
01:14:17,524 --> 01:14:20,592
Let's go, guys.
Let's throw some
balls around, huh?

995
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:22,695
The beauty
of finding yourself

996
01:14:22,762 --> 01:14:25,297
And really knowing
who you are

997
01:14:25,364 --> 01:14:27,534
Is that it allows
the possibility

998
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:30,703
For others to be a part
of your world as well.

999
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,940
Hey.

1000
01:14:35,008 --> 01:14:36,976
Heh.

1001
01:14:40,846 --> 01:14:42,682
* do you

1002
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:44,783
* want to get to

1003
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,486
* know me?

1004
01:14:46,553 --> 01:14:50,856
* every little thing that

1005
01:14:50,922 --> 01:14:54,261
* makes me me

1006
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:59,365
* if you want
the best I've got *

1007
01:14:59,431 --> 01:15:03,203
* it'll cost you
a little honesty *

1008
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:08,508
* take a deep breath

1009
01:15:08,575 --> 01:15:11,878
* and tell me what
you're feeling... *

1010
01:15:20,919 --> 01:15:23,289
Hey.
Hey.

1011
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,438
What the hell is this?

1012
01:15:42,742 --> 01:15:43,975
We need west coast.

1013
01:15:44,043 --> 01:15:45,712
Out of the question.

1014
01:15:47,147 --> 01:15:50,117
We aren't asking,
coach.

1015
01:15:53,885 --> 01:15:55,387
This isn't a democracy.

1016
01:15:55,454 --> 01:15:58,725
He knows Sierra
better than any of us.

1017
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:02,394
Come on, you guys.
Get back to class.

1018
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:07,700
Brooklyn?

1019
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:10,137
You need to find
a way, coach.

1020
01:16:10,202 --> 01:16:12,204
This is a team issue,
Brookie.

1021
01:16:12,271 --> 01:16:14,706
No. No,
it's personal, daddy.

1022
01:16:14,773 --> 01:16:16,576
So find a way.

1023
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:19,545
Either Conor plays,
or none of us play.

1024
01:16:19,612 --> 01:16:21,913
There's a national
title on the line.
We're a team.

1025
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,650
Remember?

1026
01:16:23,715 --> 01:16:25,784
Sullivan's a good kid,
and he's been
through a lot,

1027
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:27,286
But he's not up to this.

1028
01:16:27,353 --> 01:16:29,822
And he'll take you all
down with him.

1029
01:16:31,324 --> 01:16:33,726
Then we all go down
together.

1030
01:16:35,195 --> 01:16:37,364
Big game today, dad.

1031
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:42,735
I'm sure you'd have something
inspirational to say.

1032
01:16:46,838 --> 01:16:48,808
Well, guess what?

1033
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,144
I met a girl.

1034
01:16:51,211 --> 01:16:53,479
She's beautiful, dad.

1035
01:16:55,148 --> 01:16:57,849
And the best part is...

1036
01:16:57,916 --> 01:17:00,486
She's Milligan's daughter.

1037
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:03,555
I'm sure you got
a kick out of that.

1038
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:09,362
You should see
my right-handed shot.

1039
01:17:13,299 --> 01:17:15,535
I miss you, dad.

1040
01:17:21,174 --> 01:17:23,108
I'm gonna get it done.

1041
01:17:23,176 --> 01:17:25,212
I promise you.

1042
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:37,757
Look sharp,
west coast.

1043
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:40,360
Respect the game,
east coast.

1044
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:46,031
You ready
to win this?

1045
01:17:46,097 --> 01:17:47,899
How cute is he?

1046
01:17:47,966 --> 01:17:49,702
He looks
like his father.

1047
01:17:53,773 --> 01:17:57,176
Let's go!
Sideline, everybody!

1048
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:01,180
Gather up, gentlemen.

1049
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,715
This is it.

1050
01:18:03,783 --> 01:18:06,052
The national championship
is on the line.

1051
01:18:06,117 --> 01:18:08,153
It's yours to win.

1052
01:18:08,221 --> 01:18:10,990
Hands in, gentlemen.
Do or die.

1053
01:18:11,057 --> 01:18:13,059
"Warriors" on three.

1054
01:18:13,124 --> 01:18:14,160
One, two, three!

1055
01:18:14,226 --> 01:18:16,062
Warriors!

1056
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:19,866
Let's go, baby!

1057
01:18:19,932 --> 01:18:22,269
To the national high school
lacrosse championship,

1058

Courtesy of lacrosse-x.Com.

1059
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:27,206
This will be the first ever
national high school
lacrosse championship,

1060
01:18:27,274 --> 01:18:30,710
Featuring the best
of the east...
the Briarfield warriors...

1061
01:18:30,777 --> 01:18:33,380
Versus the best of the west...
The Sierra lions.

1062
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:35,315
Shake hands.

1063
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,182
The captains shake
as we get ready

1064
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,387
For the national championship
high school match-up.

1065
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:45,292
Dude. Midfield,
new team.

1066
01:18:45,358 --> 01:18:47,294
Fresh start,
green hornet.

1067
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,296
What's Riggins
doing here?

1068
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:51,230
Late-season transfer.

1069
01:18:51,298 --> 01:18:53,198
How sweet is that?

1070
01:18:53,266 --> 01:18:55,100
You hear me, Sullivan?

1071
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,635
Did you say
something?

1072
01:18:56,702 --> 01:18:58,203
Both teams at midfield
as we get underway.

1073
01:18:58,271 --> 01:18:59,739
We'll have a chance to see

1074
01:18:59,806 --> 01:19:01,240
If west coast lacrosse
is ready

1075
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,008
For the national stage,

1076
01:19:03,075 --> 01:19:04,744
And whether they can overcome
the transfer

1077
01:19:04,811 --> 01:19:06,279
Of their former
star player...

1078
01:19:06,345 --> 01:19:18,223
Number 9, Conor Sullivan.

1079
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,225
All right, all right!

1080
01:19:21,994 --> 01:19:23,330
Shot, and a goal!

1081
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:26,031
Briarfield goes
on the board first.

1082
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,770
Possession Sierra,
to number 14...

1083
01:19:30,837 --> 01:19:32,805
That's Riggins moving
the ball up the field.

1084
01:19:32,872 --> 01:19:35,908
Unchallenged
on the outside.

1085
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:38,311
And a nice save
by the Briarfield goalie,

1086
01:19:38,378 --> 01:19:40,780
And the ball's out
the other way.

1087
01:19:40,847 --> 01:19:42,782
These east coast teams
can move the ball well,

1088
01:19:42,849 --> 01:19:44,650
And Briarfield's "d"
is doing just that

1089
01:19:44,716 --> 01:19:46,251
With a diagonal
up the field.

1090
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:54,461
Go to 3!

1091
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:57,128
And a shot!
Goal, Briarfield.

1092
01:19:57,195 --> 01:19:58,465
Late in the second quarter,

1093
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,032
With a 3-1
Briarfield advantage.

1094
01:20:01,099 --> 01:20:02,669
Shot Sierra... score!

1095
01:20:02,735 --> 01:20:05,572
All right, good finish!

1096
01:20:07,206 --> 01:20:08,675
Let's do it!

1097
01:20:13,078 --> 01:20:14,113
Goal, Briarfield!

1098
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,448
Yes!

1099
01:20:20,353 --> 01:20:22,253
Number 9... Sullivan...

1100
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:24,190
Doing it all by himself.

1101
01:20:24,255 --> 01:20:26,525
Sullivan scores!

1102
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,563
This could be
a different game tonight

1103
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,964
If 9 were still wearing
the purple of Sierra.

1104
01:20:46,045 --> 01:20:48,580
Sierra just needs one
to take the lead,

1105
01:20:48,647 --> 01:20:52,751
And the later in the game
we go, the more the momentum
seems to shift to Sierra.

1106
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,864
Oh, and a huge hit
by number 77!

1107
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:06,532
Next time,
take his head off!

1108
01:21:06,598 --> 01:21:08,534
And Sierra's gonna
have a shot here.

1109
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,536
We're under a minute,
tied at 9.

1110
01:21:16,074 --> 01:21:19,811
Sierra working it around,
controlling the pace.

1111
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:23,249
They swing it back up top.

1112
01:21:23,314 --> 01:21:24,816
Riggins,
stick somebody!

1113
01:21:24,884 --> 01:21:27,719
They've got time
to set something up.

1114
01:21:30,355 --> 01:21:34,125
And a goal! Sierra has
scored the go-ahead goal!

1115
01:21:34,192 --> 01:21:37,564
Sierra has just silenced
this home crowd.

1116
01:21:37,629 --> 01:21:40,331
28 seconds.

1117
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:41,501
This is embarrassing.

1118
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:43,436
We gotta tie this up.

1119
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:46,038
What you got in mind?

1120
01:21:46,105 --> 01:21:47,440
You're captain America.

1121
01:21:47,507 --> 01:21:49,374
Nah, they know
my moves.

1122
01:21:49,442 --> 01:21:51,209
That's why we
gotta change it up.

1123
01:21:51,276 --> 01:21:52,579
Hey, offense, get in.

1124
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:54,547
Come on, guys.

1125
01:21:56,314 --> 01:21:58,485
Briarfield needs
a big play

1126
01:21:58,551 --> 01:22:00,052
If they hope
to pull this out.

1127
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:01,420
Break!

1128
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,523
Let's go, white!
Nice play, white!

1129
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:05,257
Come on, guys.

1130
01:22:05,323 --> 01:22:06,993
Come on, Briarfield!

1131
01:22:07,059 --> 01:22:10,095
Here we go.
National title on the line.

1132
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:11,463
10-9, advantage Sierra.

1133
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,399
Captain America!

1134
01:22:13,465 --> 01:22:16,936
Sullivan! Find Sullivan!

1135
01:22:17,003 --> 01:22:18,870
The ball's down.
The ball's up.

1136
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:21,474
Oh! Possession Briarfield!
That's Joe Bryant.

1137
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:23,842
The long stick is going
across midfield.

1138
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:25,410
He's looking to pass inside.

1139
01:22:25,478 --> 01:22:28,279
Finds Sullivan.

1140
01:22:28,346 --> 01:22:30,215
Sullivan with a great dodge.

1141
01:22:30,281 --> 01:22:32,584
He cuts to the middle,
looking for his big left.

1142
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:35,687
Needs a shot.
No, he dishes back!

1143
01:22:35,754 --> 01:22:39,424
Goal Briarfield!
There's no time on the clock.

1144
01:22:39,492 --> 01:22:41,027
But we are not done yet.

1145
01:22:41,093 --> 01:22:43,496
Hey, we've got overtime.
Don't get kicked out of this.

1146
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:45,430
You east coast guys, man.

1147
01:22:45,498 --> 01:22:48,000
Talk about overrated.

1148
01:22:48,067 --> 01:22:50,435
Did Riggins just
call me east coast?

1149
01:22:50,503 --> 01:22:52,539
You are, aren't you?

1150
01:22:52,605 --> 01:22:55,141
That's not captain America.

1151
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:57,076
It is over here.

1152
01:22:57,143 --> 01:22:59,011
Ladies and gentlemen,
by coaches' choice,

1153
01:22:59,078 --> 01:23:01,480
There will be no overtime.
We're still in there.

1154
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,584
The game will be decided
by braveheart.

1155
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:07,119
Why are we doing
braveheart?

1156
01:23:07,186 --> 01:23:08,920
Before the game,
the officials asked,

1157
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:10,589
"do you want to do
overtime or braveheart?"

1158
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:12,959
You agreed
without asking me?

1159
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,626
I didn't know
a west coast team
would be that good.

1160
01:23:14,693 --> 01:23:18,263
Let's go!
This is our game!

1161
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:20,567
All right, guys.
Settle down, it's not over.

1162
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:23,268
Come on, settle down.

1163
01:23:23,334 --> 01:23:28,206
Gentlemen, the game is gonna
be decided by braveheart.

1164
01:23:28,273 --> 01:23:29,508
Dupree, that's you.

1165
01:23:29,576 --> 01:23:31,643
Not me, coach.
Bryant's hurt.

1166
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:34,614
But Conor's not.

1167
01:23:37,448 --> 01:23:40,986
You know these guys
better than Dupree.
It has to be you.

1168
01:23:41,053 --> 01:23:42,622
Sullivan,
you up for this?

1169
01:23:45,725 --> 01:23:48,160
Okay, we know Sullivan's
looking for a fight.

1170
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:50,630
Find it for him.
Hit him, and hit him hard.

1171
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:53,065
Sooner or later,
he'll lose it.

1172
01:23:55,568 --> 01:23:57,836
All right, let's do it.

1173
01:24:01,107 --> 01:24:04,075
Let's do it!
Let's go! Let's go!

1174
01:24:04,143 --> 01:24:05,644
The nets will be brought
to center field.

1175
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:07,379
This is sudden death.

1176
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:09,315
No time on the clock,
no time outs.

1177
01:24:09,381 --> 01:24:12,952
Simple rules. The first
to score wins the game.

1178
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:23,528
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join us on the field
for braveheart.

1179
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,196
Oh, I can't take this.

1180
01:24:25,263 --> 01:24:28,266
We have to go.

1181
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:32,071
Braveheart may be
a new development
for organized lacrosse,

1182
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:34,573
But its pedigree comes straight
out of the sport's history

1183
01:24:34,641 --> 01:24:37,276
As a true test
of a warrior.

1184
01:24:37,343 --> 01:24:39,578
No rest, nowhere to hide...

1185
01:24:39,646 --> 01:24:41,479
Just man-on-man
sudden death.

1186
01:24:41,546 --> 01:24:45,584
Who has the heart to
battle it out to the finish?

1187
01:24:45,652 --> 01:24:47,620
Down.

1188
01:24:47,687 --> 01:24:50,421
Too bad your dad's
not here to see
you lose.

1189
01:24:50,488 --> 01:24:52,057
Don't worry.

1190
01:24:52,124 --> 01:24:54,661
There's more than enough
of him here.

1191
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:58,731
Possession Riggins.

1192
01:24:58,798 --> 01:25:01,399
Driving Sullivan
up the field.

1193
01:25:01,466 --> 01:25:03,368
Left hand hold.

1194
01:25:03,435 --> 01:25:04,535
No clean opportunity.

1195
01:25:04,603 --> 01:25:06,438
Come on, Conor.

1196
01:25:06,505 --> 01:25:07,839
Fires. Blocked.

1197
01:25:07,906 --> 01:25:10,308
First chance for Sierra
comes up short.

1198
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:12,210
And now to Sullivan.

1199
01:25:12,277 --> 01:25:13,846
Come on, Sullivan.

1200
01:25:13,913 --> 01:25:17,816
Sullivan looks
for an opportunity.

1201
01:25:19,686 --> 01:25:22,053
And he's down. Riggins...

1202
01:25:22,121 --> 01:25:25,157
Going back the other way.
Sullivan holding ground.

1203
01:25:25,224 --> 01:25:26,993
Riggins lowers
his left shoulder,

1204
01:25:27,058 --> 01:25:28,760
Tries to spin.
No movement.

1205
01:25:28,827 --> 01:25:30,528
Sullivan denies.

1206
01:25:30,595 --> 01:25:32,563
You can take him.
Come on, Conor!

1207
01:25:32,631 --> 01:25:34,801
Come on, get him!

1208
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:38,304
Riggins fires
from the outside,

1209
01:25:38,369 --> 01:25:40,605
And shot blocked.
Easy save.

1210
01:25:40,673 --> 01:25:42,440
Back the other way.

1211
01:25:42,507 --> 01:25:44,375
Let's go, Sullivan.

1212
01:25:44,442 --> 01:25:46,477
Ohh!

1213
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:48,546
Riggins lays into him.

1214
01:25:48,613 --> 01:25:50,249
Get used to that,
Sullivan.

1215
01:25:50,316 --> 01:25:52,017
This contest
is a bit chippier

1216
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:53,853
As time goes on
and tempers flare.

1217
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,554
Sullivan looks fired up
by the contact.

1218
01:25:56,621 --> 01:25:58,123
Come on, come on!

1219
01:26:01,227 --> 01:26:03,561
Sullivan hunting
for the game-winner.

1220
01:26:03,629 --> 01:26:05,063
Working the right side now.

1221
01:26:05,131 --> 01:26:07,166
Come on!
Come on, Sullivan.

1222
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:09,701
Lining up for his big left.

1223
01:26:09,768 --> 01:26:12,004
Fires it!
A clutch save!

1224
01:26:12,071 --> 01:26:14,506
You can't let him
take that, Riggins!

1225
01:26:18,009 --> 01:26:20,479
Riggins gets past Sullivan.
He's driving.

1226
01:26:20,546 --> 01:26:22,113
Take him down!

1227
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:24,050
Get him!

1228
01:26:24,115 --> 01:26:25,616
A shot!

1229
01:26:25,684 --> 01:26:27,353
Ohh!

1230
01:26:27,419 --> 01:26:30,588
His stick got tangled up
in Sullivan's facemask.

1231
01:26:30,655 --> 01:26:34,625
The shot was wide,
but Briarfield may be
in trouble here anyway.

1232
01:26:34,693 --> 01:26:35,795
You all right, son?

1233
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:37,562
Conor...

1234
01:26:37,628 --> 01:26:39,298
Hope you score a lot
of goals tonight, son.

1235
01:26:39,365 --> 01:26:41,032
But it's important
how you score.

1236
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:43,202
Never put yourself
above the game.

1237
01:26:43,269 --> 01:26:45,371
I have to let them
beat on me and just take it?

1238
01:26:45,436 --> 01:26:47,473
Temper's good.
It's how you use it
that matters.

1239
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:50,209
If you fight again,
you are off my team.

1240
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:52,278
Promise me that
you'll show humility.

1241
01:26:52,344 --> 01:26:53,945
When you fight,
you quit.

1242
01:26:54,012 --> 01:26:55,381
It's more than
a game, west coast.

1243
01:26:55,446 --> 01:26:57,349
When are you
gonna learn that?

1244
01:26:57,416 --> 01:27:00,252
A warrior
doesn't run from pain.

1245
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:03,956
A warrior
gets the job done.

1246
01:27:09,027 --> 01:27:11,262
9, you okay?
If you can't continue,

1247
01:27:11,329 --> 01:27:13,132
I'm gonna have to
call a forfeit.

1248
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,036
Nah.

1249
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:20,571
We've got business.

1250
01:27:20,638 --> 01:27:21,873
All right,
play on!

1251
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:25,778
Come on, boy!

1252
01:27:25,845 --> 01:27:28,347
Sullivan attacks, powers.

1253
01:27:28,414 --> 01:27:29,916
Come on, Sullivan!

1254
01:27:33,752 --> 01:27:35,153
Ride him, Sullivan!

1255
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,122
Push him out!
Push him out!

1256
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:39,724
Riggins giving nothing away.

1257
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:41,293
Come on, come on.
Take the shot!

1258
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,296
Sullivan spins,
he's got an opening.

1259
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:50,302
It's in! It's in!

1260
01:27:50,369 --> 01:27:53,439
Briarfield wins!
Briarfield wins!

1261
01:27:55,307 --> 01:27:58,277
The first national high school
lacrosse championship

1262
01:27:58,344 --> 01:28:01,280
Will go to the east coast
Briarfield warriors.

1263
01:28:01,347 --> 01:28:05,484
Thanks for being part of
a great championship game.

1264
01:28:35,381 --> 01:28:37,449
Congratulations
on the game, Conor.

1265
01:28:37,516 --> 01:28:40,920
Coach, thanks again
for the second chance.

1266
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:42,955
I could say
the same to you.

1267
01:28:44,622 --> 01:28:46,458
Great job.

1268
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,830
Good job, Conor.

1269
01:28:51,898 --> 01:28:54,065
Coach,
congratulations.

1270
01:28:54,132 --> 01:28:55,467
Thanks. You played
a hell of a game.

1271
01:28:55,534 --> 01:28:57,802
Impressive...
Captain America.

1272
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,906
Nice right-handed shot.

1273
01:28:59,972 --> 01:29:03,342
Yeah? Well, now I'm
ambidextrous, too.

1274
01:29:03,409 --> 01:29:05,544
Way to go.
Your boys played well.

1275
01:29:08,614 --> 01:29:09,748
Thank you, honey.

1276
01:29:09,814 --> 01:29:12,483
Congratulations.

1277
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:16,121
Go ahead.

1278
01:29:17,723 --> 01:29:18,789
You heading back?

1279
01:29:18,857 --> 01:29:21,928
Unfinished business.

1280
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:23,595
Sergeant major.

1281
01:29:23,662 --> 01:29:25,796
Hey.

1282
01:29:25,864 --> 01:29:27,433
I gotta ask you...

1283
01:29:27,498 --> 01:29:29,868
Hammering down
the house...

1284
01:29:29,936 --> 01:29:32,404
Metaphor or not?

1285
01:29:34,805 --> 01:29:37,608
Hey. Are you okay?

1286
01:29:37,675 --> 01:29:39,011
Yeah.

1287
01:29:39,078 --> 01:29:42,613
Well done, honey.
Thanks, mom.

1288
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,984
Hey, Sullivan.

1289
01:29:45,051 --> 01:29:46,518
You got a minute?

1290
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,321
With all due respect, sir,

1291
01:29:50,389 --> 01:29:52,857
I need a few minutes
with my family.

1292
01:29:52,925 --> 01:29:54,593
All right. Nice job.

1293
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:06,004
It isn't easy
watching people you love
get hurt,

1294
01:30:06,071 --> 01:30:07,638
And it's impossible
to replace

1295
01:30:07,705 --> 01:30:09,507
Some things in life
that are lost.

1296
01:30:09,574 --> 01:30:11,509
But everything I look for
in a person...

1297
01:30:11,576 --> 01:30:14,012
Someone who stands up
when they're knocked down,

1298
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:15,914
Can work with a team,

1299
01:30:15,982 --> 01:30:18,249
And has strength
and humility...

1300
01:30:18,316 --> 01:30:20,351
Can be found
through this game.

1301
01:30:20,419 --> 01:30:23,155
Maybe that's why lacrosse...
Or baaga'adowe...

1302
01:30:23,222 --> 01:30:26,624
Is known by another
even older name...

1303
01:30:26,691 --> 01:30:28,160
The creator's game.

1304
01:30:28,227 --> 01:30:30,429
Native Americans
believe they play

1305
01:30:30,496 --> 01:30:32,563
For the pleasure
of their creator.

1306
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:36,635
Sometimes I think that's
why we do anything at all.

1307
01:31:00,925 --> 01:31:03,494
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise

1308
01:31:03,562 --> 01:31:06,298
As we honor the memory
of lieutenant colonel
Sully Sullivan

1309
01:31:06,365 --> 01:31:09,101
With a missing man
formation.

1310
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,910
You do your dad
a great honor.

1311
01:31:19,978 --> 01:31:22,081
Respect the game.

1312
01:31:22,148 --> 01:31:24,615
Hey, Sullivan,
give me your stick.

1313
01:31:24,682 --> 01:31:28,119
You know what?
Today you're gonna
carry this.

1314
01:31:28,186 --> 01:31:32,224
Lead us out.
Let's go.

1315
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:34,925
Let's go!
Let's get it
done, men.

1316
01:31:34,993 --> 01:31:37,795
*

1317
01:32:13,932 --> 01:32:15,934

* want to get to

1324
01:32:32,918 --> 01:32:34,485
* know me?

1325
01:32:34,553 --> 01:32:38,956
* every little thing that

1326
01:32:39,023 --> 01:32:42,094
* makes me me

1327
01:32:44,196 --> 01:32:47,298
* if you want the best
I've got *

1328
01:32:47,365 --> 01:32:51,137
* it'll cost you
a little honesty *

1329
01:32:52,537 --> 01:32:56,507
* take a deep breath

1330
01:32:56,575 --> 01:33:00,010
* tell me what
you're feeling *

1331
01:33:00,078 --> 01:33:05,250

* take a deep breath

1333
01:33:11,089 --> 01:33:17,496
* and let your kiss say
everything you mean to say *

1334
01:33:18,929 --> 01:33:24,302
* everybody thinks
we're too young *

1335
01:33:24,369 --> 01:33:28,939
* we should just
be friends now *

1336
01:33:29,006 --> 01:33:31,576
* don't complicate

1337
01:33:33,878 --> 01:33:36,046
* they don't

1338
01:33:36,114 --> 01:33:39,484
* have the magic we do

1339
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:43,889
* they have never ever

1340
01:33:43,954 --> 01:33:46,557
* felt this way

1341
01:33:49,261 --> 01:33:51,962
* I can't get my mind off you

1342
01:33:52,029 --> 01:33:56,235
* do you feel
the same way I do? *

1343
01:33:57,868 --> 01:34:01,673

1344
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:05,075

* take a deep breath

1347
01:34:16,254 --> 01:34:22,528
* let your kiss say
everything you mean to say *

1348
01:34:24,663 --> 01:34:28,566
* we'll run away together

1349
01:34:28,633 --> 01:34:32,170
