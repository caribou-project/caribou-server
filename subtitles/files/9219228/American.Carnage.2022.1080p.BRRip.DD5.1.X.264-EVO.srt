1
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:51,327
Welcome.

2
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,538
Welcome to the land of the free,

3
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,206
home of the brave.

4
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:59,042
A country of the people, by the people,

5
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,670
for the people.

6
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:04,549
Where if you work hard,
your dreams can come true.

7
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:08,344
A safe haven for families
from all walks of life.

8
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:11,305
On behalf of everyone
from this great land,

9
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:16,394
we welcome you, embrace you,
because we need you.

10
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,187
In Spanish, braceros means

11
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,815
a man who works with arms and hands.

12
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:23,693
We need leaders.

13
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,695
And the Oscar goes to...

14
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,280
We need icons.

15
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,823
I'd like to thank...

16
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:30,116
<i>Mi gente Latino.</i>

17
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,741
We need entertainment.

18
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,244
Hi, baby bear, I'm Dora.

19
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,203
And I'm-

20
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:35,746
Miguel.

21
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,623
Quite a run.

22
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:38,707
Immigrants.

23
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:40,376
We get the job done.

24
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:42,587
We need fresh ideas.

25
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,088
Barbie in Mexico is stunning

26
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,591
in her ceremonial dress,
and her chihuahua is adorable.

27
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,055
But most of all...

28
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:55,349
We need villains.

29
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,186
So you can point your fucking fingers,

30
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:00,480
and say, "That's the bad guy."

31
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:02,607
So we can scare people.

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,400
They're immigrants.

33
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:06,360
They're invaders.
Let me finish!

34
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:07,320
Let me finish.

35
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:08,738
Let me finish!

36
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:12,283
These aren't people.
These are animals.

37
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,701
Why do you hate us?

38
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,661
Because we're Mexicans?

39
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,498
As the illegal invasion

40
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,583
at our southern border intensifies...

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,461
We're gonna do whatever is
necessary to build a wall.

42
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,589
And a one-way ticket back
to where you came from.

43
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:27,882
It is an invasion.

44
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,258
I'm fucking American!

45
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:31,344
Don't fucking touch
my burrito, bitch!

46
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,513
So there's an enemy to fight.

47
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:36,307
If you don't speak English
and don't contribute, get out.

48
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,142
The best way to describe them

49
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,936
is to be more like a summer camp.

50
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,437
To make money.

51
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:44,774
It does seem like the
America that we know and love

52
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,484
doesn't exist anymore.

53
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,152
To stay in power.

54
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:52,448
And most importantly,
to feel like heroes.

55
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:54,325
It does not mean,
because we created them,

56
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,743
that we somehow forgive them

57
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,620
or do not take
them out of society

58
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,872
to protect my family
and yours from them.

59
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:00,998
Do not come.

60
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,127
Do not come.

61
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:08,881
This American carnage
stops right here

62
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:12,009
and stops right now.

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,974
God bless you and God bless
the United States of America.

Ninja, what's up?

88
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:30,922
I need a favor.

89
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:33,834
You can't just grab a man
by the headphones anymore.

90
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:35,301
Could you cover
the drive-through?

91
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:36,784
Rosita just canceled
and I just need

92
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,155
to bring the kids
to their yaya's.

93
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,181
But Ninja, I'm
about to clock out.

94
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:41,974
Please, please, please.

95
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,976
Stop it.
Please.

96
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:47,855
All right.

97
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,649
Fine. I'll cover
your shift, okay.

98
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,444
Don't worry about it. Have fun.

99
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,570
Thank you.

100
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,156
Ha ha, you got stuck
in the drive-through.

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Oh, shut up!

102
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:00,368
What can I say?
I'm just a nice guy.

103
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:01,619
People love me.

104
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,496
Welcome to Lady Liberty.

105
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,099
Would you like to try
our new triple patty

106
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:07,208
bacon blasted combo for 5.99?

107
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,042
Yeah.

108
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,710
I'll have a smokehouse burger.

109
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:12,672
Take some fries, put
'em on the burger,

110
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,216
then cut that bitch in half.

111
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,468
Uh, we don't do that here.

112
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:18,845
What?

113
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:20,888
I said we don't do that here.

114
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:23,182
Special orders.

115
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,560
♪ We about to act up ♪

116
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,941
Yo bro, you can't
cut it in half?

117
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,776
You got knives, don't you?

118
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:36,404
You got hands, so what's
the fucking problem?

119
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:39,782
Yeah, we just serve the
food here as advertised, is all.

120
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:42,326
You see the whip I'm driving?

121
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,203
Yeah.
You see the clothes I'm wearing?

122
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:47,623
Does it look like I give a
shit what you usually do?

123
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,625
Okay. So let me
get this straight.

124
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,544
You think because
I'm serving you

125
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,796
that I'm your servant, right?

126
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:55,840
You understand this?

127
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,424
Huh?

128
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,135
<i>Habla dinero?</i>

129
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,012
Lameass wetback.

130
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,432
Wetback. Ooh, wetback?

131
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:07,685
Okay, so you've been a racist
your whole life, I'm guessing.

132
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,936
And you're telling me

133
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,689
the best you can
come up with is wetback?

134
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:12,773
Really?

135
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,860
Why don't I give you
a little help here? Excuse me.

136
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,278
Customers of Lady Liberty,

137
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,238
can I have your
attention, please?

138
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:21,442
I have these two lovely
gentlemen here in front of me,

139
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:24,577
and they're wondering if we
have any wetbacks here tonight.

140
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,745
What are you doing?

141
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,830
Do we have any beaners here?

142
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:29,514
Any greasers-
Can I just get my burger?

143
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,666
What about some vatos

144
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,794
or some cholos, huh?
Motor bandits.

145
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:35,838
Hey, go back to where
you came from, bro.

146
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,842
Thank you valued customer.
Have a nice day.

147
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:44,680
Hey! Making friends, I see.

148
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,391
Dang, such a social butterfly.

149
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:48,744
You know me, girl,
just gotta call out

150
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:49,685
the haters of the world.

151
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:50,853
Okay.

152
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,063
Oh, and Andrea look,

153
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,499
I got this very special
milkshake for you.

154
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,191
Oh, I'm vegan.

155
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,734
She vegan, bro.
You're vegan?

156
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:57,985
Sorry.

157
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,237
Girl, I'm an Aquarius,

158
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,548
I think the universe might be
trying to tell us something, huh?

159
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:02,698
Do you feel that?

160
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,367
It's in the air or something.

161
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,410
I can almost hear it.
Please stop.

162
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,930
Oh, shh, we're having a moment.
Shh, shh!

163
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:08,871
I hear it too.

164
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:09,831
What is that? What is that?

165
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:12,542
JP, code 12 in the bathroom.

166
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,335
Someone clogged
the shitter again.

167
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,147
Nice try, twerp.
I'll take that.

168
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,091
Oh, mom wants us home at eight.

169
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:22,510
Try to make that.
Wait, why eight?

170
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:23,386
You didn't hear?

171
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,680
Lily got into Columbia!

172
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:26,597
Girl.

173
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:27,849
Oh, not now.

174
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:30,518
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't realise. I'm so sorry.

175
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,187
You got into Columbia?

176
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,480
Yeah.

177
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,564
Isn't that kinda far?

178
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,191
Come on, move it.

179
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,710
You got some people
in the back here.

180
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,820
Don't worry about it.
I love you, loser!

181
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:42,071
Bye! Love you, bye!

182
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,827
So, when were you gonna tell me?

183
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,328
Aren't you happy for her?

184
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:52,540
Yeah, it's just like
New York is far away, so...

185
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,334
She will always
be there for you.

186
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:57,003
You'll be there for her tonight?

187
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,921
Yeah, of course
I'm gonna be there.

188
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,676
I love you too.

189
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:13,894
Hello?

190
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:16,981
Get down on the
motherfucking ground!

191
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,274
Shit!

192
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:22,361
Say hello to WorldStar, pussy.

193
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:24,030
Scott Williams of Riverside

194
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,907
once sharted
in third period French.

195
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,200
Come on, man.

196
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:28,326
Low blow.

197
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,411
Never should have told you that.

198
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:31,496
Nope.

199
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,641
Well, so anyway, I heard
your sis got into college.

200
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:35,833
Yeah.

201
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,335
How you holding up?

202
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,730
It's always been her dream
to get into an Ivy League school.

203
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:40,754
So that's pretty good.

204
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:41,798
I'm happy for her there.

205
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,342
And now we got a place to
stay in the Big Apple, huh?

206
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,095
And college parties and
girls, it's gonna be lit.

207
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,262
My man.

208
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:50,723
You know, I cannot wait to
give one of those rich girls

209
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:55,478
the famous Scott's special.

210
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:58,231
What does that even look like?
Two inches of regret?

211
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,941
Dude, I'm a five and half.
Sure. Right.

212
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,026
Let's go with that.

213
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,237
And according to Cosmo,
that shit is average.

214
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,656
You're gonna help me load
these into the freezer?

215
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,036
It's like that, is it?

216
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,496
No, that's cool. That's cool.

217
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,998
I'll just smoke this joint
with my real friends.

218
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,849
I saw that milkshake
move with Andrea.

219
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,392
Oh yeah?
Weak.

220
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,835
Dude, what are
you talking about?

221
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:37,145
Everybody loves milkshakes.

222
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,688
Nah, for real, dude.

223
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,565
You gotta step up your game.

224
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,609
Do we even serve anything
that a vegan can eat?

225
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,363
Uh, pickles?

226
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,201
Shit, no, no. I love a pickle.

227
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:54,871
I just, I prefer it on
a slab of dead cow.

228
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,332
Later, man.

229
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,378
I don't care what he says,
everybody loves milkshakes.

230
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,130

Oh, wow.

240
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:57,892
Yo, anybody ever tell you
you have resting dumb face?

241
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,352
You just salty, all right?

242
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:01,062
Because you're jealous.

243
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,040
Okay, I'm gonna send
this to Andrea then.

244
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:04,664
Why you gotta do me
like that? Come on.

245
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,543
Hey, you don't see me
knock your hustle, do you?

246
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,319
Hashtag, is your
brain on Tide pods?

247
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:12,573
Very savage.

248
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:14,134
But you know what,
I'm gonna let it slide

249
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:16,786
'cause it's your big day
and all that, okay?

250
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:17,787
That's right!

251
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,206
My sis going to Columbia.

252
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:21,749
Columbia.

253
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,976
It looks like I got the looks

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,168
and the brains of the family.

255
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:26,754
Ooh, a lot of pressure
on my shoulders.

256
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:29,340
Gotta take care of us.
Oh, do you now?

257
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,423
Yes.

258
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,846
Hey, I'm proud of you.

259
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:36,806
Okay, who are you?

260
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,117
Not like I'd be caught dead

261
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:41,144
with any of those nerd bombers.

262
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:43,354
Ew, nerd bombers?
But it suits you.

263
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:46,274
Your whole aesthetic,
very nerd bomber-esque.

264
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,276
You could go to college as well.

265
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:50,945
Lily, Lily, Lily.

266
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:52,238
Lemme tell you something.

267
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,115
Lemme put you on game
real quick, all right?

268
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,784
There are two kinds of
people in this world.

269
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,161
There are workers.

270
00:11:58,369 --> 00:11:59,370
Oh, yes sir. No, sir.

271
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:00,597
And they do that
their whole lives.

272
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,765
And then you got the hustlers.

273
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,183
They be doing it for
a little bit of time.

274
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,087
They're there, but then
they're always thinking.

275
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,252
They gotta find a way out.

276
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:07,879
They're percolating in the head.

277
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,422
That's me.

278
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,191
I don't even know
what that means.

279
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:13,301
It means I'm a buy mom
a big ass house

280
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,635
before you even graduate.

281
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,803
Oh, really?

282
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,555
With all that
Lady Liberty money?

283
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,390
Oh, 'cause you balling now

284
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,350
'cause you on
that burger chains?

285
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:23,519
More like that burger chain.

286
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,688
Uh... Wrong.

287
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,065
Here, let's take a
picture for mami.

288
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,275
Let me fix my hair.

289
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:36,115
Girl, what do you got
there behind your ear?

290
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,634
Nothing.
What are you talking about?

291
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,744
Behind your ear?
JP, just...

292
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:42,789
You get some ink?

293
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:44,999
JP, not a word.

294
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,711
Snitches get stitches.
Uh-huh. This is cute.

295
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:49,878
Come on.

296
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,172
Butterfly though, really?

297
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:53,007
Okay, because it's
my spirit animal.

298
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,175
Isn't that kind of basic?

299
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,137
Spirit animal?

300
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,848
Isn't a butterfly an insect?

301
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,040
Oh, look at that.

302
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,250
Cute.

303
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,667
Very nice.

304
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:33,297
Loser.

305
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:43,850
And I'm very happy to share
my joy with everyone here.

306
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,978
Lily, I couldn't be
more proud of you.

307
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:48,563
<i>Salute.
Salute.</i>

308
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,440
<i>Salute.</i>

309
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,777
Lily, you deserve to enjoy
every moment of happiness

310
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,446
that surely lies ahead of you.

311
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:57,905
And start with this one, mija.

312
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:58,989
Ay, Mami!

313
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,077
It's okay, mom, really.

314
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,829
I'm just gonna be
a phone call away.

315
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,122
Besides, JP's gonna be here.

316
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:08,916
He's gonna be
handling it, right JP?

317
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,652
You promise to take
care of things?

318
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:14,046
Immigration, get down!

319
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,050
Please, don't!
Show your hands!

320
00:14:29,896 --> 00:14:31,522
Hey! Lily!

321
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,442
Please, no... Please! No!

322
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,282
This just in from the capital.

323
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:44,076
Governor Finn has declared
a sudden state of emergency,

324
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,205
issuing a surprise
executive order.

325
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,084
Issuing a surprise
executive order

326
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:54,587
commanding the task
forces across the state

327
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,548
to carry out widespread arrests
of illegal immigrants,

328
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,551
in what many are calling
a blatant political ploy

329
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:02,178
to galvanize his base

330
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:04,472
before the upcoming
gubernatorial election.

331
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:06,057
As a civil rights lawyer,

332
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,975
but more importantly
as a human being

333
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,310
and someone's daughter,

334
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:12,063
I find this executive order
just atrocious.

335
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:14,941
In response to estimates
that nearly two million

336
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:17,276
illegal immigrants live
in just his state alone...

337
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,616
Governor Finn has
issued an executive order,

338
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,661
commanding task forces
to arrest the children

339
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:28,454
of these immigrants as well,

340
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:31,165
even if they were born
here in the United States.

341
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:33,209
For aiding and
abetting their parents

342
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,128
by not reporting
them to authorities.

343
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:37,922
I have only two words to
say about our recent efforts

344
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:41,217
to expel illegal aliens
from our beautiful state.

345
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,761
Zero tolerance.

346
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:56,816
Single file line.

347
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,572
No phone calls.

348
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,051
Assholes!

349
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,136
Stop!

350
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:26,804
Let go of me!

351
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:28,181
Assholes.

352
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:32,477
Come on, let's go! Move it!
I just wanna see my family again...

353
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:34,561
Lily?

354
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:35,687
Lily!

355
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,609
Lily, it's me. It's JP.

356
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:41,527
Lily!

357
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:43,029
Lily! Lily!

358
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:22,462
I saw you on TV.

359
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:24,088
You're the one trying
to get the judge

360
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:25,923
to overrule the governor, right?

361
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:27,758
It's overturn.

362
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:29,718
And yes.

363
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:34,514
We lost.

364
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,643
We're not done
fighting yet though.

365
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:40,021
We'll appeal to the Supreme
Court if we have to.

366
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:41,647
How long does that take?

367
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,192
Hard to say.

368
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,694
Weeks, months maybe.

369
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,404
This is bullshit.

370
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:50,490
Governor Finn will do
everything in his power

371
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:52,742
to drag this out
until the election.

372
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:54,178
Children of illegal immigrants

373
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,788
aren't exactly known
for voting Republican.

374
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:58,831
What? Is that a crime now?

375
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:03,961
No, but aiding and
abetting an illegal alien is.

376
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:06,088
You mean being raised by my mom?

377
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:08,216
What? Is my sister
like an accomplice now?

378
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,634
Listen to me, JP.

379
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,803
Governor Finn wants all the
detained immigrants

380
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:13,096
gone by election day.

381
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,181
Gone, like deported?

382
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,184
They wanna deport my
mom just like that?

383
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,314
Now, we can stop
that from happening.

384
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:26,943
If a natural born American
citizen claims her

385
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:30,905
as a member of their biological
family, she'll be released.

386
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,407
Me and Lily, problem solved.

387
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:36,702
No. As long as you and your sister
remain under state custody,

388
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:39,330
you can't bring forward
any legal claims.

389
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:46,244
But we do have another option.

390
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:57,890
What's this?

391
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:01,727
The Elderly American Tolerance
and Understanding project.

392
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,438
This community service program

393
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:06,691
where volunteers help
care for senior citizens.

394
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,819
The DA is offering
to drop all charges

395
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:11,237
if you complete this program.

396
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,786
So it's this or go to court?

397
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:22,331
Choice is yours.

398
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:25,585
No, it isn't.

399
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:28,671
You all know why you're here.

400
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:31,507
Successful completion
of this program

401
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:35,303
is your only chance to
return to your normal lives

402
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,388
and your families.

403
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:38,931
Juan Pablo Valdes.

404
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:40,808
That's Valdes with
an S, not a Z.

405
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:41,952
Here, I'll spell that for you.

406
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:46,564
G-O-F-U-C-K-Y-O-U-R-S-E-L-F.

407
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:49,275
See? No Z.

408
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,486
Camilla Montes.

409
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:54,572
Full-time activist,
part-time political prisoner.

410
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:57,784
What's your country of origin?

411
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:03,080
I'm a red-blooded American,
but my mom is from Mexico.

412
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:05,917
While you are a
participant in this program,

413
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,504
there will be no communication
with the outside world.

414
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:10,838
Chris Morales.

415
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:15,176
I got chronic anxiety
and delusional paranoia.

416
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:18,304
Is it really hot in here?

417
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:20,473
Is there even windows in here?

418
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:21,474
There's no air in this room.

419
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:23,101
My throat gets super dry...

420
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:24,685
There's water
there if you'd like.

421
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:25,811
Dude, what's in it?

422
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:28,022
LSD? Flunitrazepam.

423
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:29,273
No.
One mistake.

424
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:34,946
And I will personally
drag your ass back here.

425
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:37,949
They call me Big Mac.

426
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:40,243
Know what I'm talking about?
You wanna know why?

427
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,078
'Cause I'll be
macking the big hoes.

428
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,496
The BBW.

429
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:45,790
Big ladies need love too.

430
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,417
What's your country of origin?

431
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:53,756
Am I in here because
I'm Latino or black?

432
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:55,507
Or both?

433
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:57,467
Confusing?

434
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,429
These ankle
monitors will alert us

435
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:02,473
if you're not in your assigned
rooms by curfew.

436
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:05,351
If it starts beeping,
you have five minutes

437
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:07,854
to haul ass back to your room.

438
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:11,566
Micah Fuentes, gluten-free
vegan, Democrat socialist.

439
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:13,109
Is that a crime yet?

440
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:14,861
What's your country of origin?

441
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:17,655
United States of Americas,
Argentinian parents.

442
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,367
But you can just write down
divided states of America.

443
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:23,595
You ever been affiliated
with a gang

444
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,830
or any violent organization?

445
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:29,292
Housekeepers, landscapers,
busboys, construction workers.

446
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,752
We get together in secret,

447
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:35,214
and we work the jobs that
nobody else wants to do

448
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:37,842
for less than minimum wage.

449
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:39,927
Ever inhaled or ingested
any non commercial drugs

450
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:41,387
or state-altering substances?

451
00:22:41,554 --> 00:22:42,764
Zoloft.

452
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,930
Lithium.

453
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,558
That's some racist shit though.

454
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:47,310
To assume that I use drugs.

455
00:22:47,477 --> 00:22:49,353
Clozapine, risperidone,
Xanax and Adderall.

456
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:51,773
Do I assume you dance
poorly to Vanilla Ice,

457
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:53,191
dressed in your khaki shorts

458
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:54,984
while stress eating
a kale salad?

459
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,903
And sometimes it
balances with carbamazepine

460
00:22:57,028 --> 00:22:59,739
and diboplorex.

461
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:03,951
Do you have a criminal record?

462
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,411
Of course I do.

463
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,039
Y'all wanna know what I did?

464
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:12,752
I stole hearts in the
fourth grade.

465
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:17,965
And if any of you geniuses
decide to try and escape,

466
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:23,679
you will enter a world of shit.

467
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:15,939
Hello?

468
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:19,818
Mr. Davis.

469
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:23,197
Please, call me Eddie.

470
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,409
Everyone meet Mr. Eddie Davis.

471
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:28,661
Founder of the Elderly
American Tolerance

472
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:31,789
and Understanding project,
and your supervisor

473
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:33,749
for the next three months.

474
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,168
Thank you, Bruce.

475
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:40,715
At Alcove, compassionate
elder care is our mission.

476
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:42,717
It's what we do.

477
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:44,677
So we truly appreciate
you being here

478
00:24:44,844 --> 00:24:49,432
to help out our seniors in
so many ways, big and small,

479
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,476
but maybe they can help you too.

480
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:56,981
I mean, the truth is we
all have so much to learn

481
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,525
from our most
experienced citizens.

482
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:01,819
And I promise you, you
stick with the program,

483
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:05,156
you're gonna leave this place
more mature, fully grown.

484
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:09,076
You may even gain a newfound
appreciation for life.

485
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,267
I'm gonna turn you over to
our operations officers,

486
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,459
Cynthia and James.

487
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,270
And I just wanna remind
you that you are doing

488
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:21,589
the residents of Alcove
and your country,

489
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:23,466
a tremendous service.

490
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:28,179
Thank you.

491
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:30,556
All right guys, listen up.

492
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,266
I'm gonna show you guys' room,

493
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,726
where you'll be
sleeping at night.

494
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,354
It's nothing fancy as you
will see, but let's be honest.

495
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:38,439
Between this and
foil sleeping bags,

496
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,233
I know which one I'd choose.

497
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:43,528
You got the essentials,
your bed, desk, lamp.

498
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,030
We'll get you anything
you need, just ask us.

499
00:25:46,114 --> 00:25:47,865
Better be in there before curfew

500
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:49,450
or your ankle bracelet
will go off...

501
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:54,747
Water therapy and aqua aerobics.

502
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:57,750
Yes, the pool is heated
and no, you may not use it

503
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,335
under any circumstances.

504
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:01,129
Relaxation is big here.

505
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,505
So no matter what happens,

506
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:05,299
it's very important that
the guests remain calm.

507
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:11,681
The common area.

508
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:14,308
This is the true heartbeat
of our operation.

509
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:16,525
This is where you'll
spend most of your time

510
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:17,812
entertaining our guests.

511
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:21,315
Your job is to play chess,
read to them, blah, blah, blah.

512
00:26:27,697 --> 00:26:29,198
Hey, Big Mac. Keep up.

513
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:31,451
This is our garden.

514
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:33,453
It's very popular
with the residents.

515
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:35,347
As you will see, they'll
come out here to relax,

516
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:37,415
close their eyes and meditate.

517
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:39,375
By meditate, I just
mean take a nap.

518
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,631
Think that you'll find if
you stick to the program,

519
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:47,967
follow the rules
and stay in line,

520
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,470
your time here should be pretty
fast and easy, all right?

521
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:53,347
Look at this.
Look at this.

522
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:54,599
Well, I be damned!

523
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:57,477
How am I supposed to maintain
my superior intellect

524
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,979
eating this nasty ass meat loaf?

525
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:02,440
Hey. Psst!

526
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:03,524
White girl.

527
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:04,692
White girl.

528
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:06,569
Is he talking to me?
He's talking to you.

529
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:08,529
I suggest you say something.

530
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:11,449
You know, 'cause your skin.

531
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,910
'Cause us white people like...

532
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,161
Yeah.

533
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:16,996
I'm Argentinian,.

534
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:18,581
So, you're not white?

535
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:21,209
Dude, all these old people,

536
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,461
do we have to, like, touch them?

537
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:25,838
Do you realize how
dumb you sound right now?

538
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:28,341
You're gonna be old one day.

539
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:30,319
We put my grandpa in a
nursing home and he loved it

540
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:31,427
'cause he got so much ass,

541
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:33,471
'cause every old lady
in there was DTF.

542
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:34,554
All of 'em.

543
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:36,599
Okay, you know what, we
really don't wanna hear

544
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:38,402
about your granddaddy
fornicating right now.

545
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:39,977
Yeah, grandpa died
five weeks later.

546
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:41,261
And when they did the autopsy,

547
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:43,231
they found like seven
different STDs on him.

548
00:27:43,314 --> 00:27:46,484
Full head of herpes sore
at the funeral like...

549
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,404
No, my point is, you
wanna get gonorrhea,

550
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:52,365
go ahead and touch a
few of these geezers.

551
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,408
You don't gotta touch
'em with your dick.

552
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,244
Um... Speak for yourself,

553
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,038
'cause I might want some
of that fermented vagina.

554
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:00,224
You know what I'm talk about?

555
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:02,208
Stop talking about
old people sex.

556
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,501
You started it.

557
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:05,086
You know what I want?

558
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:11,092
I would kill for a Lady
Libs fish filet right now.

559
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:13,636
It's not fish though.

560
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:16,389
Say what? What you
mean it's not fish?

561
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,391
What's in my filet?

562
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:19,809
You don't wanna know.

563
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:21,060
That's why I'm vegan.

564
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:22,937
I only eat what my mom cooks.

565
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,356
She's the only person I
trust not to poison me.

566
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,458
Okay, so you're not eating that?

567
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:28,067
No, man. Or drinking.

568
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:29,277
That's how they get you.

569
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,945
Would you all just shut up!

570
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:33,948
This isn't summer camp.

571
00:28:34,532 --> 00:28:36,200
What is wrong with her?

572
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:38,870
She know what's in that
fish filet, don't she?

573
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:39,953
All right.

574
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:42,582
Time for you guys to
look the part. Come on.

575
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:51,549
Well, pick your poison.

576
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:54,927
Erectile dysfunction or
irritable bowel system?

577
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:56,179
It's syndrome.

578
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:57,430
Same thing.

579
00:28:58,139 --> 00:28:59,140
Great.

580
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,087
Wow, where's my man with the...

581
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:02,268
There you go.

582
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:13,529
Hey.

583
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:17,992
Uh, I'm JP and I'm here
with the...

584
00:29:20,244 --> 00:29:22,205
The program, I guess.

585
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,707
So if you need
anything or like...

586
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,625
You...

587
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:28,878
Hey sweetie, we're here to help.

588
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:31,838
What do we do?

589
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:35,802
Here.

590
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:37,095
We can read to them.

591
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:40,807
Oh God, please tell me
you know how to read.

592
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,268
No, yeah.
I know how to read.

593
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:46,062
I can... I could read.

594
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:47,897
That doesn't sound
convincing at all.

595
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:50,441
I'll read.
I know how to say words if...

596
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:52,568
Good luck.

597
00:29:57,573 --> 00:29:58,991
This is stupid.

598
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:00,952
Not you.

599
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:02,035
Oh.

600
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,372
Sorry.

601
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:05,748
I'll just read.

602
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:08,917
You know.

603
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:16,342
He thought back on his family
with deep emotion and love.

604
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:18,386
His conviction that he
would have to disappear

605
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:21,097
was, if possible, even firmer
than his sister's.

606
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:26,477
I cannot make you understand.

607
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:30,523
I cannot make anyone understand
what is happening inside me.

608
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:33,860
I cannot even explain to myself-
You will die here.

609
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,319
Sorry?

610
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:37,572
You will die here.

611
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:40,408
I can... I can
pick another book.

612
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:43,911
You will die here.

613
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,955
You will die here.

614
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:48,541
Back off. Back off.

615
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,209
You've done enough.

616
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:52,376
I was just reading a book-
Don't wanna hear it.

617
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,798
Doesn't... Where are
you guys taking her?

618
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,427
Smooth.

619
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:02,555
You really got a way
with the ladies.

620
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:09,353
Chris, you should
really eat something.

621
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:10,688
No. No way.

622
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,064
They're not gonna break me.

623
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:13,459
At least have some water, man.

624
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:14,918
You're not gonna last
unless you hydrate.

625
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:16,628
I won't have to, 'cause
I'm getting outta here.

626
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:18,652
What are you talking about?
You trying to escape?

627
00:31:18,696 --> 00:31:19,822
Yeah, good luck with that.

628
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:23,618
What?

629
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,767
They're probably
watching us right now.

630
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:34,104
They're waiting to
see if any of us

631
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:35,463
have the nerve to defy them.

632
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:36,547
Who's they?

633
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:38,508
Exactly.
Who are they?

634
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:39,759
I don't know. You don't know.

635
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:41,052
Maybe they don't even know.

636
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:42,553
You've gotta be kidding.

637
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,448
Do you honestly think
it's crazy to try to escape?

638
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:46,599
You know, I don't care
if I look crazy, all right?

639
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:47,785
Oh, you sure the hell don't.

640
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,495
Why don't you just stop
talking all this shit

641
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,728
and go try it then?

642
00:31:51,354 --> 00:31:52,647
You know, maybe I will.

643
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,941
No, Chris. Chris.
You're a little fragile right now.

644
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,400
You're hangry, Chris!

645
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:58,236
I don't think you should do it.
Chris.

646
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:00,071
Don't do that.
Don't...

647
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:06,531
Yeah, it was an accident.

648
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:07,578
I tripped. I'm sorry.

649
00:32:07,662 --> 00:32:09,330
Oh.

650
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:14,961
Oh, you know
he pissed on himself.

651
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:16,420
Let go of me.

652
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:18,131
No. No...

653
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:19,632
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Moron.

654
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:21,676
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

655
00:33:58,773 --> 00:33:59,773
Virgil.

656
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:02,985
Will set you free.

657
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,405
It's Virgil.

658
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,451
Virgil.

659
00:34:11,702 --> 00:34:13,788
Virgil will set you free.

660
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:16,290
Virgil will set you free.

661
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,591
Relax, it's okay.
Virgil.

662
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,593
It's okay.
Set you free.

663
00:34:27,677 --> 00:34:29,429
Virgil.
Hey, hey, hey it's okay.

664
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:32,098
Will set you free. Free!

665
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:33,181
Hey...

666
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:37,436
Virgil will set you free.

667
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:39,856
Virgil will set you free.

668
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:41,498
Virgil will set you free.
I found her.

669
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:42,858
She's here.

670
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:44,735
Mrs. Wells, stop it.

671
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:47,612
All right, let's
get her off of him.

672
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:54,494
It's okay.

673
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,121
Just come with us.

674
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:57,790
Go back to your room.

675
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,583
Nice job, black bean.

676
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,335
Get in your damn room.

677
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:02,836
Now!

678
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,423
Make sure her door's
locked this time.

679
00:35:16,976 --> 00:35:20,104
I wanna apologize for what
happened to JP last night.

680
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:21,856
That never shoulda happened.

681
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:25,485
You guys should probably see
the entire facility now.

682
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:27,862
Where's Chris?

683
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:31,741
Don't even look at me.

684
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,076
This is ward B.

685
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:36,621
All of our residents
here have been diagnosed

686
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:39,040
with advanced dementia
or Alzheimer's.

687
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:41,417
As you can see,
they tend to regress

688
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:43,336
back to their natural instincts.

689
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:47,548
Unfortunately, our role here
is a purely palliative one.

690
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:48,841
Meaning what?

691
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,260
Keep 'em comfortable,
spoon feed 'em,

692
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:53,012
wipe their asses till they die.

693
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:55,598
That's morbid,
Camilla, but not wrong.

694
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:59,185
Anyway, someone left the
door unlocked last night.

695
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:00,978
Thus our wanderer.

696
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,688
Can we help them instead?

697
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:04,666
Oh, sure. You
can assist James.

698
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,067
He'll show you what to do.

699
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,486
Why not?

700
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:10,363
Anyway, back to work everyone.

701
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,282
Thanks.

702
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:14,617
Kiss ass.

703
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:16,702
All right.

704
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:18,871
Mr. Yates here, we gotta
get him outta this chair

705
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:19,955
and into a bed.

706
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:21,499
Think you can handle that?

707
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,210
Yeah, sure.
Good.

708
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:35,596
So why is he strapped in?

709
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:37,265
It's for his own good.

710
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:41,519
Mr. Yates here
is a bit of a biter,

711
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:44,312
aren't ya?

712
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:47,066
Probably eat me alive.

713
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:49,152
Stupid old fuck.

714
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:51,612
Hey, don't do that.

715
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,281
Chill, hombre.

716
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:54,740
Just having some fun.

717
00:36:54,824 --> 00:36:56,784
Hey man, don't call me hombre.

718
00:36:56,868 --> 00:36:58,244
Don't call you what?

719
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:01,873
Kid, I'll call
you hombre, chico,

720
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:05,460
nacho, burrito, or whatever
the fuck else I wanna call you.

721
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:06,961
<i>Comprehende, amigo?</i>

722
00:37:07,044 --> 00:37:08,105
Better back off, Supercuts.

723
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:09,129
Or what?

724
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:10,631
Everything okay?

725
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:13,217
Absolutely, Eddie.

726
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,762
Just showing JP here the ropes.

727
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:17,137
All good.

728
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:23,895
Welcome to my shit list, bitch.

729
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:26,939
Now, help me put
this old fuck to bed.

730
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:28,023
Now.

731
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:32,695
Get his strap.

732
00:37:40,953 --> 00:37:41,829
Fuck!

733
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:43,790
Get off me! Get off.

734
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,042
Hey, hey, stop.

735
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:47,667
Stop!

736
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:49,170
Don't hurt him...

737
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:19,324
Lily?

738
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,203
Lily.

739
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,002
But how?

740
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,131
You're not gonna believe it,

741
00:38:33,214 --> 00:38:35,341
but turns out we've only
been like a mile apart

742
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:36,467
this whole time.

743
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:41,264
Hey, here.

744
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:44,142
Hey JP, save your strength.

745
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:09,167
Just tell me one thing.

746
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:13,754
You promise to take care
of things.

747
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:21,637
Hey, welcome back.

748
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,739
How long was I out?
About a half hour.

749
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,315
Feels like a lifetime.

750
00:39:34,484 --> 00:39:35,818
How's Mr. Mason?

751
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:37,737
I don't know, but
if I'd have to guess,

752
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,072
I'd say he's getting a lobotomy
for what he did to you.

753
00:39:40,156 --> 00:39:41,156
Oh, don't say that.

754
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:43,075
He probably doesn't
remember that he bit me.

755
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:45,745
That, or maybe you
have a forgettable taste.

756
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:50,958
I taste a whole lot
better with hot sauce.

757
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,167
Oh, okay.

758
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,970
Well, maybe next time
I'll slip him a bottle.

759
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,343
Are you finished?
Oh, yeah.

760
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:02,011
I've been done with
this for a while,

761
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:04,263
but I'd just rather
hang out here with you

762
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:06,599
than spend time with
James and Cynthia

763
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:08,267
and the rest of those assholes.

764
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:09,601
I get what you mean.

765
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:11,080
It feels like they
treat the patients

766
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:14,565
more like cattle
than actual people.

767
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,817
Exactly, and it's like

768
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,361
that's someone's <i>abuelo </i>or <i>abuela</i>.

769
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:19,736
Right.

770
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:22,156
Hey, since we're stuck here,

771
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,243
maybe we can teach them
how to treat their own.

772
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,161
Yeah.

773
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:29,371
Yeah.

774
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:31,665
Deal.

775
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:35,461
I am tired of
these damn noodles.

776
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:39,132
Okay? You know, I would kill
for a hamburger right now.

777
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:41,801
Fernando, I would choke him
out for a burger right now.

778
00:40:42,844 --> 00:40:43,886
Murder somebody.

779
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,223
Guys, where's Chris?

780
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:50,017
Maybe he made his escape.

781
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:51,144
Busted outta here.

782
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:52,645
Flew the coop.

783
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:55,189
Wrap it up. Back
to work in five.

784
00:40:55,273 --> 00:40:57,525
Cynthia, have you seen Chris?

785
00:40:57,859 --> 00:40:59,777
They sent him back to
the detention center.

786
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:01,070
What the fuck!

787
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:03,573
You try to escape,
that's what happens.

788
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:09,537
Look, that's a lie.

789
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,830
Why?

790
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:13,332
'Cause I found
this in the hallway.

791
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:16,210
Look, there's no way that
wheezy, half-a-lung dude

792
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:18,212
would leave without this.

793
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:19,422
All right?

794
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:23,050
He may not be eating,
but he using this.

795
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:56,167
Mr. Phillips, my main man.

796
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,627
You know what time it is?

797
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,003
It's movie time.

798
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:01,631
Oh yeah, James says you
wasn't feeling too well.

799
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:04,175
So, I thought a movie
might cheer you up.

800
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:05,343
Plus...

801
00:42:07,178 --> 00:42:08,221
got you a date.

802
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:11,140
Oh yeah, get your little
elderly edition of Netflix

803
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,101
and uh... don't die on me.

804
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:18,022
Y'all laughing in the inside.

805
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:19,986
I ain't gonna let y'all
play with me. I'm funny.

806
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:21,484
I'm go ahead and
hook this TV up.

807
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,446
Is that a DVD, VCR combo?

808
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,490
That's how they
doing you, Mr. Phillips?

809
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:28,574
All right.

810
00:42:28,658 --> 00:42:30,243
We gonna figure this out.

811
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,955
This is a relic, but...

812
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,500
let Big Mac go to work.

813
00:42:41,003 --> 00:42:42,839
This is crazy.

814
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:45,800
I don't even know
where to begin.

815
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:47,760
You got one of them fat backs.

816
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:50,179
Oh my, what type
of setup is this?

817
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:51,431
I don't even...

818
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,600
It's all right.

819
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:55,684
It's all right.

820
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:06,850
I'm a figure this out, Mr. Phillips.
Don't worry about it.

821
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:08,698
You know, I'll talk to James.

822
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,700
Gotta get you a new one...

823
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:16,747
Mr. Phillips?

824
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,040
You okay?

825
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:26,632
Mr. Phillips.

826
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,491
Mr. Phillips' not breathing.

827
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:53,785
Did you see anything
what happened?

828
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:07,506
No.

829
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:46,169
Chill!

830
00:44:47,171 --> 00:44:48,297
Chill! Chill!

831
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:13,989
All right.

832
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:15,908
I know you all must
have some questions,

833
00:45:15,992 --> 00:45:18,369
but I gotta be
honest with you guys.

834
00:45:18,453 --> 00:45:19,596
I don't pretend to understand

835
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,414
what happened to
Mr. Phillips,

836
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:24,124
yet.

837
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:30,006
The way he died is shocking
and frankly incomprehensible.

838
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:30,965
Uh-uh, it ain't right.

839
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:33,718
Dude last night was inside
out and upside down.

840
00:45:34,218 --> 00:45:35,720
What?
Yes.

841
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:38,097
The origin appears to be...

842
00:45:38,264 --> 00:45:40,308
Seriously, it's the most
disturbing thing

843
00:45:40,391 --> 00:45:41,517
I've ever seen in my life.

844
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:43,912
We're conducting a thorough investigation
into his care, and I expect...

845
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:46,689
Man, you know where I grew up.
I've seen some disturbing shit.

846
00:45:46,773 --> 00:45:48,316
Big Mac.
Hm?

847
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:49,525
Care to chime in?

848
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,736
No, no. Um...

849
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,742
I was just saying, man,
poor, poor, Mr. Phillips.

850
00:45:57,825 --> 00:45:58,659
I feel bad for him.

851
00:45:58,743 --> 00:46:00,578
That was my guy, man.

852
00:46:01,412 --> 00:46:02,497
Yeah.

853
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:03,915
It's unfortunate.

854
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:04,874
Oh, Mr. Phillips.

855
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:09,504
I'll be here if anyone
needs any help processing.

856
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:11,087
Okay?

857
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:18,304
JP, can I borrow
you for a moment?

858
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:26,938
Meet Virgil, not that
his name really matters.

859
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,606
Why is that?

860
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:30,566
He's a barn owl,
no more, no less.

861
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,970
He never asks
himself, "Who am I?"

862
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:33,778
But rather, "What's my job?"

863
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:39,158
Look over there.

864
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:44,872
Tyrannus melancholicus.

865
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:51,921
Charming little species.

866
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,384
The only problem is, it's
not native to the region.

867
00:46:56,801 --> 00:46:58,636
It's taking the jobs
of the birds who are

868
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,055
by eating the crickets and
leaving less to go around.

869
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:07,270
Virgil's job, aside from
eating and one day being eaten,

870
00:47:07,437 --> 00:47:08,896
is to maintain order.

871
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,190
But he can't do it alone.

872
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:15,653
He does his part, trusting
that those just like him

873
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,863
are doing the same.

874
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:22,034
Let's say he's the
gatekeeper of Alcove

875
00:47:22,118 --> 00:47:25,246
both inside the facility
and out.

876
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:32,378
But unlike Virgil, I don't have
eyes in the back of my head.

877
00:47:33,463 --> 00:47:35,756
So I have to trust that the
two of you are doing your jobs

878
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,467
and not letting anything,

879
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:39,802
a stupid fight, to pick
a hypothetical example,

880
00:47:39,886 --> 00:47:41,179
get in the way.

881
00:47:41,262 --> 00:47:44,307
My entire business
hangs on this trust.

882
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:47,185
Am I wise to invest
this trust in you?

883
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:49,269
Yeah.
Yes.

884
00:47:49,312 --> 00:47:50,521
Great.

885
00:47:50,605 --> 00:47:52,064
I'll let you two hug it out.

886
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:53,356
Hug?

887
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:02,492
Truce?
Okay.

888
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:06,996
I'm gonna make your
life a living hell.

889
00:48:07,288 --> 00:48:09,916
Shh, shh, shh.
Don't kill the vibe.

890
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,584
What are you doing?

891
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:13,002
Fuck, man.

892
00:48:13,377 --> 00:48:14,378
Jesus Christ.

893
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:20,259
<i>Pendejo.</i>

894
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:24,312
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

895
00:48:24,347 --> 00:48:26,933
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

896
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:30,978
Oh...

897
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:55,795
♪ It's Big Mac and
the haters after me ♪

898
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:59,549
♪ I only like big chicks
to eat hot calories ♪

899
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,641
You know what, I'm not
even ashamed of this.

900
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:10,935
I'm a thug. I punch
people in the face.

901
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:12,519
No. Yeah, I know.

902
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:13,997
You mind just
giving me a minute.

903
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,189
Do you mind just...

904
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:16,357
Let me get myself.

905
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:17,859
Hey, hey.

906
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:20,069
You ain't gon' tell
anybody, right.

907
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,570
You good.

908
00:49:21,612 --> 00:49:22,612
You ain't gon'...

909
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:23,573
Wait, wait, wait.

910
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:25,116
That don't sound too believable.

911
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,199
That don't sound too...

912
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:38,629
Pool party. What do you say?

913
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:39,857
Almost done with curfew check.

914
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:40,881
Get in!

915
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:43,718
Ooh, thanks.

916
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,052
No problem.

917
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:50,767
Gotta say, did not peg you
as a trouble-making type.

918
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,935
Mm-mm.
Troublemakers get caught.

919
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,313
So you're just a bad boy?

920
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:58,441
For who, I wonder.

921
00:50:01,694 --> 00:50:02,695
Turn around.

922
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:07,325
Hey, if she were into girls,
I'd try to hit that too.

923
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,035
Oh, yeah?

924
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:12,455
Then again, maybe I could
change your mind about that.

925
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:16,918
Relax, bro. I'm not
gonna stand in your way.

926
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,845
JP, what are you doing here?

927
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:29,764
It's way past curfew.

928
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:34,352
Care for a swim?

929
00:50:34,894 --> 00:50:36,187
She called you a what?

930
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,271
A six.

931
00:50:37,355 --> 00:50:39,190
Wow.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

932
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:41,400
She's clearly tripping.

933
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:43,026
Thank you.

934
00:50:43,152 --> 00:50:44,278
You're a four at best.

935
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:45,822
Come on.

936
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:47,573
At best.
Seriously?

937
00:50:47,657 --> 00:50:49,951
At best.
Oh, wow. Come on.

938
00:51:11,722 --> 00:51:12,807
What's that?

939
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:16,352
I mean, you never heard of it?

940
00:51:17,728 --> 00:51:18,896
What does it mean?

941
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,231
No, it's not...

942
00:51:21,524 --> 00:51:23,776
It's like when all of
your senses come together

943
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,986
in a perfect way.

944
00:51:25,903 --> 00:51:27,071
Hey, look, I'll show you.

945
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:29,490
Close your eyes.

946
00:51:30,575 --> 00:51:31,575
Close 'em.

947
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:37,415
How does that smell?

948
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,876
Like brandy.

949
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:41,836
No. Come on, try harder.

950
00:51:45,631 --> 00:51:46,632
Fruits.

951
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:49,969
Cherries.

952
00:51:50,178 --> 00:51:51,846
Yeah, very good.

953
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:59,103
How does that feel?

954
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:03,524
Smooth.

955
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,530
How does that sound?

956
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,200
Sounds soft.

957
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:14,868
Very soft.

958
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:18,456
Open your eyes.

959
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,251
How do I look?

960
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:25,838
Beautiful.

961
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,593
Well, there's only
one sense left, JP.

962
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:35,722
Taste.

963
00:52:51,364 --> 00:52:52,365
<i>Si.</i>

964
00:53:00,623 --> 00:53:02,208
So, are we gonna do this?

965
00:53:07,255 --> 00:53:08,255
Oh, yeah.

966
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:10,383
I mean, that is if you want to.

967
00:53:14,095 --> 00:53:15,471
Uh, yeah.

968
00:53:16,722 --> 00:53:17,890
Very, very much.

969
00:54:11,402 --> 00:54:12,402
Fuck!

970
00:54:13,362 --> 00:54:14,362
Jeez!

971
00:54:15,072 --> 00:54:16,240
Ms. Wilcox.

972
00:54:16,324 --> 00:54:18,242
What are you doing in here?

973
00:54:18,326 --> 00:54:19,744
Come here, let me help you.

974
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,620
Gotcha.

975
00:54:22,455 --> 00:54:24,791
You're not supposed
to leave your room.

976
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:28,169
I was so scared when I went in
there and you weren't there.

977
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:32,340
I'll get you back.

978
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:43,434
You smashed Micah
last night, didn't you?

979
00:54:43,518 --> 00:54:45,728
Didn't you?
Didn't you?

980
00:54:45,812 --> 00:54:46,729
You did.

981
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:47,897
That's right.

982
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,148
Okay. Respect.

983
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,817
Respect. Respect.

984
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,735
Did not know you had
that type of game, baby.

985
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,779
Hey, now you know.
Okay. I know.

986
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,982
I know. Now, tell me this.
Tell me this. Tell me this.

987
00:54:57,615 --> 00:54:59,158
How much of a freak was she?

988
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:00,493
How much was a...

989
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,098
I'm gonna tell
like three people,

990
00:55:04,122 --> 00:55:04,997
but I ain't gonna
tell nobody else.

991
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:06,642
All right, I'll tell 'em
about that face mask though.

992
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:07,500
Okay.

993
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:08,751
Okay. All right.

994
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:11,337
That's our secret to the death.

995
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,672
To the death.

996
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:14,674
She nasty. I like that.

997
00:55:14,757 --> 00:55:16,509
I'm gonna need to know
more detail though.

998
00:55:16,592 --> 00:55:17,677
I tell you that.

999
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:19,178
What's up?

1000
00:55:19,804 --> 00:55:20,804
Give me a sec.

1001
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:36,988
Hey, Greta.

1002
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:38,906
Hi.

1003
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:44,620
It's gonna sound weird, but
did anyone give this to you?

1004
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:48,916
Yeah, no?

1005
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:57,258
See, my sister, she used to make

1006
00:55:57,341 --> 00:55:59,719
the exact same cootie
catchers back at home.

1007
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:03,723
Her name was Lily.

1008
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:05,974
Do you know her?

1009
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:17,862
Okay.

1010
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:24,869
Let go of him.

1011
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:25,952
Let go!

1012
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:27,370
Let go.

1013
00:56:28,748 --> 00:56:30,333
Let's transfer her to ward B.

1014
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,918
Been a long time coming.

1015
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:39,300
Hey, what's wrong?
What happened?

1016
00:56:39,383 --> 00:56:40,676
No, I'm fine. I just...

1017
00:56:41,928 --> 00:56:43,608
I think there's something
wrong with Greta.

1018
00:56:43,638 --> 00:56:45,807
Well, clearly there is, or
else she wouldn't be here.

1019
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:47,225
Don't take it too personally.

1020
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:49,602
I don't know why she
keeps freaking out on me.

1021
00:56:50,686 --> 00:56:51,687
All right.

1022
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:53,106
It's official.

1023
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:54,607
These people are fucked up!

1024
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:56,567
But you know what's
really fucked up?

1025
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:57,944
Last night was crazy.

1026
00:56:58,027 --> 00:56:59,028
I totally blacked out.

1027
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:01,197
It makes two of us.

1028
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:04,408
After the pool, I don't
remember anything.

1029
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:07,370
And on top of that,
I'm dying out here.

1030
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,831
Wait a second.

1031
00:57:10,414 --> 00:57:11,499
Back off, creep.

1032
00:57:11,582 --> 00:57:12,458
No, just look.

1033
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:13,894
You got a weird mark on
the back of your neck.

1034
00:57:13,918 --> 00:57:16,129
Just look.

1035
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:19,924
Oh. Oh, that look
like a terrible hickey.

1036
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,759
Yeah.
Might be those needles

1037
00:57:21,843 --> 00:57:23,177
that they're always using.

1038
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:26,931
Wait, do you
remember being sedated?

1039
00:57:27,056 --> 00:57:29,976
Isn't the point of being
sedated that you don't remember?

1040
00:57:32,645 --> 00:57:34,564
There's some strange shit
going on around here.

1041
00:58:15,354 --> 00:58:16,939
That's not how I
would describe it.

1042
00:58:17,023 --> 00:58:18,542
All right. Well then,
how would you describe it?

1043
00:58:18,566 --> 00:58:20,485
It's not a scam
if you're getting paid.

1044
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:22,570
Cynthia, you're
paid to get into it.

1045
00:58:22,653 --> 00:58:24,298
You think you're so
much smarter than me.

1046
00:58:24,322 --> 00:58:26,824
You have to start somewhere.
Right now I'm just at the bottom.

1047
00:58:26,908 --> 00:58:28,826
Of the pyramid...

1048
00:59:03,194 --> 00:59:04,487
You're sure about this?

1049
00:59:05,571 --> 00:59:07,615
We can't have her
freaking out all the time.

1050
00:59:07,698 --> 00:59:10,368
Let's just double her dosage
and make our lives easier.

1051
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:12,537
All right.

1052
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,790
Let's go.

1053
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,001
I can't wait till she's gone.

1054
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:20,837
Just a matter of
days at this point.

1055
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:23,672
What?

1056
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:25,341
Did you hear that?

1057
00:59:31,722 --> 00:59:33,307
No, it's probably nothing.

1058
00:59:33,391 --> 00:59:34,434
I dunno.

1059
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:36,310
Come on. I hate this job.

1060
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:03,045
You will die here.

1061
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:06,549
You will die here.

1062
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:09,343
Holy fuck! Oh, shit.

1063
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:21,689
Have y'all seen JP?

1064
01:00:21,773 --> 01:00:23,983
Cynthia told me he's been
on kitchen duty all morning.

1065
01:00:24,066 --> 01:00:26,527
No, that was me.

1066
01:00:26,944 --> 01:00:28,112
Why do you think your lunch

1067
01:00:28,196 --> 01:00:30,031
is so irresistibly
delicious, huh?

1068
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:33,159
Your hands are blessed.

1069
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,495
Anointed.
What can I say?

1070
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,038
I'm talented.

1071
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:38,372
JP missin' out.

1072
01:00:39,624 --> 01:00:40,500
Wait.

1073
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,669
Well, we know they're lying
to us about Chris, right?

1074
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:45,378
What about JP?

1075
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:49,717
You know what? I got a idea.

1076
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,187
All right, Camilla.
You stay guard.

1077
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,456
Why do I have to stay on guard?

1078
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,920
I'll freak out if
anybody shows up.

1079
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:05,691
Plus, you think
better on your feet.

1080
01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:07,110
That's blatant flattery.

1081
01:01:08,277 --> 01:01:10,154
But okay, I'll bite.

1082
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:12,907
If you see anyone coming,
just give us a sign.

1083
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,200
What kinda sign?

1084
01:01:14,283 --> 01:01:15,368
A bird call.

1085
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:16,494
A bird call, really?

1086
01:01:17,453 --> 01:01:19,247
Yes, like ca caw, ca caw.

1087
01:01:19,372 --> 01:01:21,666
Come on, I can't even think
of anything more obvious.

1088
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:23,084
That's not obvious.

1089
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:24,460
Do you see birds?

1090
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:26,396
There's a lot of birds.
Guys, when he comes out,

1091
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,420
just fucking go.

1092
01:01:39,016 --> 01:01:40,016
Go!

1093
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,037
Ca caw, ca caw, that's it.
No.

1094
01:01:42,061 --> 01:01:43,061
Yes, it is.

1095
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:45,648
Damn.

1096
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:48,609
Okay, what are we
even looking for?

1097
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:50,820
Anything with
Chris or JP's name?

1098
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,990
This is nice.

1099
01:02:00,288 --> 01:02:02,290
Okay. I guess
I'll look over here.

1100
01:02:02,373 --> 01:02:04,208
This middle drawer's locked.

1101
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,380
There's gotta be
a key somewhere.

1102
01:02:09,714 --> 01:02:11,883
You know, maybe we
should just get outta here.

1103
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:14,927
Ah, I found one.

1104
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:17,221
That is not a key.

1105
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:18,431
But it is.

1106
01:02:18,514 --> 01:02:20,016
And no, I don't
know how to do this

1107
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:21,309
just because I'm black.

1108
01:02:21,392 --> 01:02:23,394
My father was a locksmith.

1109
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:25,813
Thank you so much
for that clarification.

1110
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:27,022
Yeah.

1111
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:29,192
I can hear you judging me.

1112
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:33,446
Give me a second.

1113
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:36,365
A little rusty, but...

1114
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:42,621
Got it.

1115
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,334
Oh, yeah.

1116
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,336
What is this?

1117
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,755
What is that?

1118
01:02:50,963 --> 01:02:53,508
It looks like a machine
or something like that.

1119
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:54,633
Oh.

1120
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:01,723
Fuck!

1121
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:06,187
Hey, James.

1122
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,272
Just who I wanted
to see actually.

1123
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:09,482
What is it?

1124
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,153
Here's Chris.
Wait, look.

1125
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:15,780
Solitary?

1126
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:17,615
The fuck!
James, so do you like...

1127
01:03:17,698 --> 01:03:19,450
What happened to the ca caw?

1128
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:20,576
Okay, we gotta go.

1129
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:21,994
He hasn't been eating.

1130
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:23,555
Just go spoonfeed him
some tuna or something.

1131
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:24,622
Dude, I just wanna know-

1132
01:03:24,705 --> 01:03:27,291
Camilla, be quiet and go, now.

1133
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:49,147
What do we have here?

1134
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:55,486
All right.

1135
01:04:03,035 --> 01:04:07,498
So James, what's it like to
run a summer camp for wetbacks?

1136
01:04:07,748 --> 01:04:09,083
Oh yeah, it's great.

1137
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:10,793
Everything I ever wanted.

1138
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:13,880
Fuck this place, man.

1139
01:04:25,933 --> 01:04:27,560
That dude is crazy.

1140
01:04:27,643 --> 01:04:29,562
I don't know. Let's
just get outta here.

1141
01:04:30,855 --> 01:04:33,065
Oh, shit!

1142
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:34,441
Fuck!

1143
01:04:46,037 --> 01:04:47,371
Oh my God!

1144
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,175
Hey, where are we?

1145
01:04:59,717 --> 01:05:00,843
What's going on?

1146
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,893
Jesus Christ, what the
hell happened to you guys?

1147
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:11,229
What'd you guys find out?

1148
01:05:11,312 --> 01:05:12,480
I found some crazy shit.

1149
01:05:12,563 --> 01:05:14,643
Oh, these fuckers are up
to something, aren't they?

1150
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:18,069
But I'm calling it, Freemasons.

1151
01:05:18,152 --> 01:05:19,237
No, no, no, no.

1152
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,571
Lizard, no.

1153
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:22,406
No! The Illuminati!

1154
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,343
Stop talking like Chris
and tell me what happened.

1155
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:25,803
Matter of fact, actually,
poor Chris-

1156
01:05:25,827 --> 01:05:26,827
Hey, Mac.

1157
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:31,791
Help me out with something.

1158
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:34,919
No problem.

1159
01:05:35,169 --> 01:05:36,169
Come on.

1160
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:45,387
Thank you.

1161
01:05:47,432 --> 01:05:49,350
You hear that?

1162
01:05:49,976 --> 01:05:51,102
It's coming from the vent.

1163
01:05:51,436 --> 01:05:52,854
Screw must be loose.

1164
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:54,730
Fix it before dinner.

1165
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:00,153
Fix it before dinner.

1166
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:02,697
I'm onto you, James.

1167
01:06:03,448 --> 01:06:04,490
I'm onto you.

1168
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:11,956
Crap!

1169
01:06:12,623 --> 01:06:14,542
It's cool. I got it.

1170
01:06:17,795 --> 01:06:19,565
Guess he think the Mac
man can do everything.

1171
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:21,229
You know what? I can
do everything, James.

1172
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:22,550
I'm built for this.

1173
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:27,638
Oh, shit!

1174
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:28,806
Where'd he go?

1175
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:32,602
Got all this money round here,
ain't got no maintenance man?

1176
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:45,156
Big Mac.
Get back. Everyone.

1177
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:46,532
Somebody call an ambulance.

1178
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,951
Nobody's calling anyone.

1179
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:50,244
Now, get back.

1180
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:52,580
We will handle this.

1181
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:08,846
James, you there?

1182
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:11,682
We need some help
down here right away.

1183
01:07:15,103 --> 01:07:16,687
Sending someone right away.

1184
01:07:17,188 --> 01:07:19,023
You, go find Bruce.

1185
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:17,123
Looks like those
commercials are working.

1186
01:08:17,415 --> 01:08:18,666
Product's selling well.

1187
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,460
Keep your voice down.

1188
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,796
You ever tried one?

1189
01:08:23,963 --> 01:08:25,006
Have I?

1190
01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:27,383
Are you out of your goddam mind?

1191
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:29,969
Eddie, don't tell me you-

1192
01:08:30,052 --> 01:08:31,220
No!

1193
01:08:31,637 --> 01:08:32,764
But the kids have.

1194
01:08:33,181 --> 01:08:34,348
They tell the difference?

1195
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:36,768
Apparently, they taste
just like the real thing.

1196
01:08:38,186 --> 01:08:40,855
Steak, meatballs,
chilli dogs, sloppy joes.

1197
01:08:41,272 --> 01:08:43,357
Tacos.

1198
01:09:09,675 --> 01:09:11,886
Open the door. Quick, quick.

1199
01:09:17,015 --> 01:09:18,725
Three, two, one.

1200
01:09:21,354 --> 01:09:22,395
Go back to the lab.

1201
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
We'll deal with him now.

1202
01:09:27,276 --> 01:09:28,528
He's not responding.

1203
01:09:30,988 --> 01:09:33,073
Shit! Eddie's gonna kill us.

1204
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:35,701
What do we do?

1205
01:09:35,827 --> 01:09:37,286
There's only one thing to do.

1206
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:40,331
We're gonna jumpstart his system
and inject him with adrenaline.

1207
01:09:40,915 --> 01:09:42,125
No, no, no.

1208
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,792
We'll just wake him up.

1209
01:10:28,296 --> 01:10:30,298
He's the gatekeeper of Alcove

1210
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:33,092
both inside and
outside the facility.

1211
01:10:33,718 --> 01:10:36,596
Virgil will set you free.

1212
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:49,941
Fuck!

1213
01:11:05,374 --> 01:11:06,292
JP's gone.

1214
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,544
I repeat, I cannot find JP.

1215
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:27,814
Talk to me about production.

1216
01:11:27,897 --> 01:11:29,357
Well, the supply
of raw materials

1217
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,942
is going better than expected.

1218
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:32,753
We'll never run
out at this rate.

1219
01:11:32,777 --> 01:11:33,861
And the kids?

1220
01:11:34,987 --> 01:11:36,322
Any discipline issues?

1221
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:37,990
Nothing to worry about.

1222
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,244
The sedatives keep
the kids in check.

1223
01:11:41,577 --> 01:11:43,704
We also lace 'em with
highly effective hormones,

1224
01:11:43,788 --> 01:11:45,957
tenderizing their
bodies by more than 20%.

1225
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,042
So how's it working?

1226
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:49,877
The machine.

1227
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,465
The prototype produces
twice the number of patties

1228
01:11:54,549 --> 01:11:56,235
in half the time of your
average assembly line.

1229
01:11:56,259 --> 01:11:58,469
We have more product than
we know what to do with.

1230
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,239
And the results are the same

1231
01:12:00,263 --> 01:12:01,806
across all 12 of our facilities.

1232
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,687
We have a commercially
reliable product

1233
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,606
that's safe to eat, tastes
just like the real thing.

1234
01:12:11,482 --> 01:12:13,860
And best of all,
all production costs

1235
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:16,112
are covered by John Q taxpayer.

1236
01:12:16,195 --> 01:12:17,113
Hm!

1237
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:18,196
Damn!

1238
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,540
JP.

1239
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,501
What's going on?

1240
01:12:30,585 --> 01:12:31,502
What are you doing?

1241
01:12:31,586 --> 01:12:32,586
Micah.

1242
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:35,214
They did this to me.

1243
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,593
We gotta run before
they do it to everyone.

1244
01:12:38,676 --> 01:12:39,676
My God.

1245
01:12:41,387 --> 01:12:42,680
What happened to you?

1246
01:12:43,765 --> 01:12:45,099
Don't get any fucking closer.

1247
01:12:50,271 --> 01:12:51,397
Sorry, dude.

1248
01:12:57,653 --> 01:13:00,156
For the record,
we never happened.

1249
01:13:00,406 --> 01:13:02,116
I don't fuck the help.

1250
01:13:15,379 --> 01:13:16,589
Don't be afraid.

1251
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,842
Fear releases adrenaline,
stiffens the muscles.

1252
01:13:20,676 --> 01:13:21,844
Spoils the meat.

1253
01:13:23,054 --> 01:13:24,847
You're a fucking cannibal.

1254
01:13:24,931 --> 01:13:26,557
Oh, come on.
I don't eat the burgers.

1255
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:28,476
Fuck you.

1256
01:13:32,355 --> 01:13:34,273
I'm not a cannibal, JP.

1257
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:37,443
I'm an American.

1258
01:13:37,777 --> 01:13:39,654
Something you'll
never really be.

1259
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:42,365
People like you cry supremacy.

1260
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:45,284
I call it manifest destiny.

1261
01:13:45,618 --> 01:13:47,078
One nation, all our own.

1262
01:13:49,455 --> 01:13:51,290
How's my little spy
doing tonight?

1263
01:13:57,964 --> 01:13:59,006
Hungry.

1264
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:04,262
You know, JP, we used
to need people like you.

1265
01:14:05,054 --> 01:14:08,850
To pick our crops, sew our
clothes, build our cities,

1266
01:14:08,933 --> 01:14:12,854
and yes, wipe the
asses of our elders.

1267
01:14:13,062 --> 01:14:15,273
And boy, did you all deliver.

1268
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:18,818
I mean, how else do you
explain the world we live in?

1269
01:14:18,943 --> 01:14:20,361
Where you can buy
virtually anything

1270
01:14:20,445 --> 01:14:22,530
from anyone, anywhere
and have it delivered

1271
01:14:22,613 --> 01:14:24,490
to your doorstep
before breakfast.

1272
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:26,951
That doesn't just happen, JP.

1273
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,411
It's by design.

1274
01:14:32,331 --> 01:14:33,374
Ask your lawyer.

1275
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:37,253
She knows.

1276
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:40,381
It's all thanks to
people like you.

1277
01:14:43,134 --> 01:14:47,263
Doing jobs that nobody
wants for basically nothing.

1278
01:14:49,348 --> 01:14:50,558
And for that...

1279
01:14:52,518 --> 01:14:54,187
I say <i>gracias.</i>

1280
01:14:57,523 --> 01:14:59,442
But look to the future, JP.

1281
01:15:02,195 --> 01:15:03,780
This is progress.

1282
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:05,364
Automation.

1283
01:15:06,574 --> 01:15:08,618
We don't need your
cheap labor anymore.

1284
01:15:08,993 --> 01:15:10,536
You're obsolete.

1285
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:12,455
And frankly, you've
been consuming

1286
01:15:12,538 --> 01:15:14,141
more than you've been
contributing lately.

1287
01:15:14,165 --> 01:15:17,084
So for the good of my
people, you'll now supply

1288
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,253
the only thing you have left
to offer.

1289
01:15:46,697 --> 01:15:48,366
Ca caw! Ca caw!

1290
01:15:51,494 --> 01:15:52,912
If you try to escape,

1291
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:55,540
you'll be sent back to
the detention center.

1292
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,583
Do not test us.

1293
01:15:57,667 --> 01:15:59,293
We have eyes in the
back of our heads.

1294
01:15:59,377 --> 01:16:01,504
Curfew is mandatory
and non-negotiable.

1295
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:06,300
Relaxation's a big thing here,
so no matter what happens...

1296
01:17:27,465 --> 01:17:29,675
Don't apologize
for your privilege.

1297
01:17:31,219 --> 01:17:32,595
That's what Eddie says.

1298
01:17:35,056 --> 01:17:36,891
You know, I used
to fear my power.

1299
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:38,893
I know you won't believe it.

1300
01:17:38,976 --> 01:17:42,146
But I used to feel like
I didn't deserve it.

1301
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,191
Until I met Eddie.

1302
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,400
Lily.

1303
01:17:48,945 --> 01:17:50,738
What did you do to my sister?

1304
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:00,288
She's alive.

1305
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:03,334
Not for long.

1306
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:07,296
Started drugging her
the moment she got here.

1307
01:18:08,256 --> 01:18:09,423
Promise you.

1308
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:12,552
Anti-anxiety meds
dissolved in the water.

1309
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:14,220
Chris was right about that.

1310
01:18:14,637 --> 01:18:21,102
Triggering night terrors, paranoia,
violent hallucinations.

1311
01:18:22,061 --> 01:18:24,021
That one's my favorite.

1312
01:18:26,274 --> 01:18:28,734
Next, we add hormone to the mix.

1313
01:18:29,026 --> 01:18:33,865
Converting lean muscle
to tender meat.

1314
01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:37,869
That's hard work on your body.

1315
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:42,498
Your bones weaken,
dementia sits in,

1316
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:49,922
as you become slow,
confused, disoriented.

1317
01:18:51,048 --> 01:18:52,383
The perfect livestock.

1318
01:18:55,595 --> 01:18:58,222
All the while,
your season salted

1319
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:02,560
and tenderized to perfection.

1320
01:19:03,644 --> 01:19:07,774
Extreme aging wasn't an expected
byproduct of the hormones,

1321
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:11,736
but fuck, it turned out
to be the perfect cover,

1322
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:15,990
because no one wants to
look at old folks too close.

1323
01:19:16,282 --> 01:19:17,658
Age is disgusting.

1324
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:23,664
Stick grandma in a home and
forget about her, right?

1325
01:19:24,499 --> 01:19:28,753
And no, you won't die peacefully
in bed from natural causes

1326
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:33,216
because buried deep within
our genes is like this reflex.

1327
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:36,469
A final gasp of rebellion

1328
01:19:37,053 --> 01:19:39,639
where your body
just destroys itself

1329
01:19:39,722 --> 01:19:41,724
and everything else in its way.

1330
01:19:42,725 --> 01:19:46,229
A surge of violence before
your body shuts down

1331
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:49,649
to let us know that your
body's ready for the process.

1332
01:19:58,449 --> 01:20:00,952
There's a natural
order to this world,

1333
01:20:01,994 --> 01:20:04,455
and we're just
here to enforce it.

1334
01:20:06,415 --> 01:20:07,625
Here at Lady Liberty's,

1335
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,085
we like to keep things simple.

1336
01:20:09,502 --> 01:20:11,254
We serve the best
tasting burgers

1337
01:20:11,337 --> 01:20:13,381
at the lowest prices, period.

1338
01:20:13,506 --> 01:20:15,424
Like our baby blues burger.

1339
01:20:15,508 --> 01:20:17,677
Available now from 5.99.

1340
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:20,221
Made for our people
by our people.

1341
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:23,349
The same low price
as the big fancy chains.

1342
01:20:24,559 --> 01:20:25,643
Psst! Hey.

1343
01:20:26,352 --> 01:20:27,395
Camilla.

1344
01:20:27,645 --> 01:20:28,688
Oh, shit.

1345
01:20:29,355 --> 01:20:31,649
Not now. You don't look
too good yourself, okay?

1346
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:34,110
I remember the small
town I grew up in.

1347
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:40,740
Where's Big Mac?

1348
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,950
No one knows.

1349
01:20:42,535 --> 01:20:44,495
I just know he
tried to escape too.

1350
01:20:45,705 --> 01:20:47,623
We gotta get outta here.
I mean...

1351
01:20:47,707 --> 01:20:49,167
There's not much time.

1352
01:20:50,418 --> 01:20:51,711
Till what?

1353
01:20:51,836 --> 01:20:53,796
Until they come
in here, take you,

1354
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,466
take me and churn
us into some...

1355
01:21:01,262 --> 01:21:04,849
Family, duty, self-reliance,

1356
01:21:05,975 --> 01:21:06,975
hard work.

1357
01:21:09,312 --> 01:21:11,189
So long as I am your governor...

1358
01:21:12,857 --> 01:21:14,066
After dinner.

1359
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:17,737
That's when we make our move.

1360
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:22,116
I'm Harper Percy Finn.

1361
01:21:22,408 --> 01:21:25,745
And I'm asking you,
remember who we are.

1362
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:27,789
Remember who we are.

1363
01:21:27,872 --> 01:21:29,373
Remember who we are.

1364
01:21:29,499 --> 01:21:31,459
Remember who we are...

1365
01:21:51,562 --> 01:21:52,562
Hello?

1366
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,190
Hi.

1367
01:21:57,485 --> 01:21:58,569
Lily.

1368
01:22:04,826 --> 01:22:07,453
It's me. It's JP.

1369
01:22:10,414 --> 01:22:11,415
Your brother.

1370
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:13,876
You remember?

1371
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,711
You remember mom?

1372
01:22:17,964 --> 01:22:19,006
Amelia?

1373
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:21,425
Remember the woman
who growled at me

1374
01:22:21,509 --> 01:22:22,677
for throwing water balloons

1375
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,761
at the quinceanera?

1376
01:22:27,265 --> 01:22:28,265
You remember.

1377
01:22:32,103 --> 01:22:33,229
There you are.

1378
01:22:56,878 --> 01:22:58,588
I'm gonna get us out of here.

1379
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:03,134
I'm a figure it out, I promise.

1380
01:23:17,523 --> 01:23:18,733
Well, well.

1381
01:23:18,816 --> 01:23:20,735
Looks like someone's
having trouble sleeping.

1382
01:23:21,152 --> 01:23:23,029
Yeah, I think I
can help with that.

1383
01:23:28,951 --> 01:23:30,745
You little bitch!

1384
01:23:30,828 --> 01:23:32,121
What the fuck!

1385
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:36,292
All right.

1386
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:37,668
All right, you've had your fun.

1387
01:23:43,508 --> 01:23:45,384
All right, you old fucks,
back to bed.

1388
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:46,844
Last chance.

1389
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:48,387
All right, what do we do now?

1390
01:24:03,486 --> 01:24:04,486
Hey!

1391
01:24:04,529 --> 01:24:05,530
Get back here!

1392
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:09,784
Son of a bitch!

1393
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:53,369
Let go of me.

1394
01:24:57,957 --> 01:24:59,709
Get the fuck off me!

1395
01:25:16,434 --> 01:25:17,935
It's crazy down there.

1396
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:21,022
It's like the elderly
version of 300.

1397
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:22,982
I been crawling through the vent

1398
01:25:23,065 --> 01:25:25,067
like I'm black Bruce Willis.

1399
01:25:58,392 --> 01:25:59,435
JP...

1400
01:26:00,686 --> 01:26:02,230
I got pee on my hands.

1401
01:26:03,648 --> 01:26:04,648
Don't tell nobody.

1402
01:26:06,984 --> 01:26:09,237
We gotta go.

1403
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,320
We gotta go.

1404
01:26:14,367 --> 01:26:15,743
Come on.
Come on.

1405
01:26:18,788 --> 01:26:20,581
Hey, Big Mac.
What's up?

1406
01:26:21,124 --> 01:26:22,959
Thanks, man.
You're welcome.

1407
01:26:23,459 --> 01:26:24,459
You're welcome.

1408
01:27:05,334 --> 01:27:07,503
These old people
are savages, man.

1409
01:27:09,088 --> 01:27:10,088
I got her.

1410
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,999
Where the hell are we going?

1411
01:28:02,266 --> 01:28:04,060
I'm gonna find another way out.

1412
01:28:05,019 --> 01:28:06,019
Stay here.

1413
01:28:12,819 --> 01:28:14,445
Can I count on you
to stay with her?

1414
01:28:14,612 --> 01:28:16,614
I'm an asshole,
JP, not a quitter.

1415
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:18,031
Go!

1416
01:28:22,745 --> 01:28:24,539
Ca caw, motherfuckers.

1417
01:28:24,956 --> 01:28:26,499
Let's blow this bitch.

1418
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,750
Let's go!

1419
01:29:18,843 --> 01:29:20,386
Excuse me.

1420
01:29:20,803 --> 01:29:24,015
Um... Hey, can I use your
phone real quick?

1421
01:29:25,933 --> 01:29:27,101
Okay, no wow!

1422
01:29:27,602 --> 01:29:29,687
Oh, it's 'cause I'm black?

1423
01:29:30,605 --> 01:29:32,166
Or because I got all
these old people with me.

1424
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:33,190
Is that right?

1425
01:29:43,451 --> 01:29:44,619
JP, just...

1426
01:29:45,161 --> 01:29:46,454
JP!
Chris?

1427
01:29:46,537 --> 01:29:48,790
I tried to warn you guys.

1428
01:29:48,915 --> 01:29:51,375
Chris, you're alive.

1429
01:29:51,501 --> 01:29:53,669
Look what they've done to...

1430
01:30:22,365 --> 01:30:24,575
I gotta say, I admire you, kid.

1431
01:30:25,284 --> 01:30:27,328
You know, it doesn't
feel that way right now.

1432
01:30:29,247 --> 01:30:31,165
Nobody's ever made
it this far before.

1433
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:34,168
You should be proud, and
all you had was hope.

1434
01:30:34,627 --> 01:30:36,796
But hope doesn't
change things, JP.

1435
01:30:37,713 --> 01:30:38,923
Power does.

1436
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,897
You step up to take
care of your people,

1437
01:30:54,981 --> 01:30:56,983
just like I take care of mine.

1438
01:31:03,865 --> 01:31:05,491
It's nothing personal, JP.

1439
01:31:08,453 --> 01:31:09,495
Just progress.

1440
01:31:26,929 --> 01:31:27,929
Come on.

1441
01:31:30,266 --> 01:31:31,684
Are you good?
Uhhuh.

1442
01:31:32,643 --> 01:31:33,723
Let's get you outta here.

1443
01:31:33,978 --> 01:31:35,146
Bitch.

1444
01:31:37,607 --> 01:31:38,607
No!

1445
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:32,662
Hey.
Hey, get up.

1446
01:32:33,287 --> 01:32:34,831
Come on.
I got you.

1447
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,457
Let's go.

1448
01:34:11,677 --> 01:34:12,804
Oh, we did it.

1449
01:34:18,184 --> 01:34:19,184
JP?

1450
01:34:19,894 --> 01:34:20,937
JP!

1451
01:34:23,397 --> 01:34:24,565
JP!

1452
01:34:24,649 --> 01:34:25,649
JP!

1453
01:34:27,902 --> 01:34:29,946
This is a pivotal hour

1454
01:34:30,029 --> 01:34:31,656
in the immigration showdown,

1455
01:34:31,781 --> 01:34:34,325
as researchers
discover how a madman

1456
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:36,536
has taken advantage
of a broken system

1457
01:34:36,661 --> 01:34:38,329
for his own depraved agenda.

1458
01:34:38,579 --> 01:34:40,832
Amidst damning evidence,
authorities have shut down

1459
01:34:40,915 --> 01:34:42,959
Governor Finn's Lady
Liberty burger chain.

1460
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:44,710
Meanwhile, the governor himself

1461
01:34:44,794 --> 01:34:47,004
appears to have
fled the country.

1462
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,881
As researchers
scramble for a way

1463
01:34:48,965 --> 01:34:50,633
to reverse the damage Mr. Davis

1464
01:34:50,716 --> 01:34:52,552
and his co-conspirators
have done,

1465
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:55,680
the state legislature has
agreed to a suspension

1466
01:34:55,763 --> 01:34:58,182
of the executive order which
set all of this into motion.

1467
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,605
Allowing for the
immigrants to be reunited

1468
01:35:04,689 --> 01:35:06,065
with their loved ones.

1469
01:35:14,115 --> 01:35:15,116
Psst!

1470
01:35:19,912 --> 01:35:21,706
Did you just psst me?

1471
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:25,126
Oh, y'all playing games.

1472
01:35:25,918 --> 01:35:27,587
That's what we doing right now?

1473
01:35:28,463 --> 01:35:29,839
Oh, you think it's a game?

1474
01:35:30,256 --> 01:35:32,508
Y'all think this is funny?

1475
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,802
Oh, no, it's too easy.

1476
01:35:34,927 --> 01:35:36,847
Y'all playing games with
my emotions right now.

1477
01:35:36,929 --> 01:35:38,389
Y'all see me!

1478
01:35:39,056 --> 01:35:41,058
Fuck the both of
y'all, all right?

1479
01:35:41,142 --> 01:35:42,059
I'm outta here.

1480
01:35:42,143 --> 01:35:44,061
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't be like that.

1481
01:35:44,187 --> 01:35:45,188
No!
Come back, Mac.

1482
01:35:45,271 --> 01:35:46,314
Come on. Come back.

1483
01:35:46,397 --> 01:35:47,190
Come back? Come back.

1484
01:35:47,273 --> 01:35:48,649
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

1485
01:35:48,858 --> 01:35:50,338
We were taking a nap.
We were tired.

1486
01:35:50,401 --> 01:35:52,779
We literally just saw a
guy get turned into a burger.

1487
01:35:52,862 --> 01:35:54,548
You know what? Come on.
Come on. Let's go.

1488
01:35:54,572 --> 01:35:55,674
You're lucky
I respect my elders.

1489
01:35:55,698 --> 01:35:57,116
Come on, get your ass up.

1490
01:35:57,492 --> 01:35:58,576
Oh, look at that.

1491
01:35:58,951 --> 01:36:00,161
Arthritis.

1492
01:36:00,453 --> 01:36:01,704
Ain't that a bitch?

1493
01:36:01,829 --> 01:36:03,581
Uh-huh.
Come on, old lady.

1494
01:36:03,748 --> 01:36:05,708
