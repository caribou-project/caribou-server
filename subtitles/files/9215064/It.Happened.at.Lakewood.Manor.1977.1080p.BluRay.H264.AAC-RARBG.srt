1
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:16,350
(building clattering)

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,433
(machinery rumbling)

3
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,225
- Hey, come on, guys.
We don't have all day.

4
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,892
- [Charlie] Help, help.

5
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,600
Help me.

6
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,183
Help.

7
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,058
Help.

8
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:14,642
(eerie music)

9
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:15,767
Help.

10
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:20,767
Help me.
(suspenseful music)

11
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,267
Get 'em off me, get 'em off!

12
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:27,225
Help me, help me, Frank.

13
00:01:38,642 --> 00:01:41,058
- Charlie, Charlie, you okay?

14
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:44,850
Stop!

15
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,892
(suspenseful music)

16
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,642
(tense orchestral music)

17
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:07,975
<i>- [Tony] That's it out there,</i>

18
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:12,142
<i>Lakewood County, the
Las Vegas of tomorrow.</i>

19
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:14,058
- Oh, well, that won't
be for some time though.

20
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:17,350
- Oh, no, practically overnight.

21
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,850
We voted to legalize gambling
here, they cast the die.

22
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,433
- To die or the dice?

23
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,725
(both chuckling)

24
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,808
- Whatever.

25
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:27,517
We're all scrambling to
carve our name on 'em.

26
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:29,017
- I really hope that I can help you

27
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:30,350
carve your name here, Tony.

28
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,558
- I'll drink to that.

29
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:35,225
To our first adventure together.

30
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:37,142
At last.

31
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:40,558
<i>- Oh, the better hotels</i>

32
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,350
<i>would be across that lake over there,</i>

33
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,475
<i>behind that clump of rocks.</i>

34
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,975
<i>I uncovered three
properties that are for sale</i>

35
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,058
<i>in our range.</i>

36
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,892
<i>There's a hotel that's close to the lake</i>

37
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:51,808
<i>and the other two are inland.</i>

38
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,683
The Lakewood Manor is
the one near the water.

39
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,433
Maybe we could spot it.

40
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,308
- Your hair was in my eyes.

41
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,392
(Tony chuckling)

42
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:08,642
Just wondering, what hotel are we in?

43
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,267
- Oh, I book rooms at the Romer.

44
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:12,558
ZZZ?

45
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,225
- What?

46
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:15,058
- Rooms?

47
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:19,225
Put it this way, we'll be
working more closely together

48
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,683
this week than ever before, right?

49
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:24,058
Right.

50
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:27,517
And away from home, things
could be a little different.

51
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,933
I was just hoping you might
have taken it upon yourself

52
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,142
to have booked just one.

53
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:37,767
- (sighs) I do not believe in
mixing business with pleasure.

54
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,350
Now, come on, Tony, let up.

55
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,267
- Oh, come on, Gloria, letdown.

56
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,892
This is our first trip together.

57
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,683
- I really wanna do a good job.

58
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,267
And I think it's best

59
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,683
that we keep things strictly-

60
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:53,600
- Business.
- Right.

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,433
- Right.

62
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:57,267
Before pleasure.

63
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:02,267
(Gloria groans)
(light orchestral music)

64
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,475
(parrot squawking)

65
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,308
- That's not good for his diet.

66
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,767
Save it for yourself.

67
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:25,017
If Teddy were younger,
it would be all right.

68
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:28,433
But do you know that that
bird is 32 years old?

69
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,267
- Really?

70
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,058
- Really.

71
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,642
Your mother met him when
she was just about your age.

72
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:35,558
Marjorie.

73
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:36,850
- Mrs. Adams.

74
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,058
Oh, it's so good to see you.

75
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:41,517
Thank you for taking the
reservation on such short notice.

76
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,017
- Oh, nonsense.

77
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:46,058
We'll have room for you
and your family always.

78
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:47,725
- Sort of like coming home

79
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,308
every time I walk through the front door.

80
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,808
- Is your husband coming
down for the weekend?

81
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,058
- I'm not sure. Maybe.

82
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:54,808
- Mom, Dad's not coming here.

83
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:00,850
(light upbeat music)

84
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,642
- [Linda] Can I carve my initials too?

85
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,600
- (chuckles) I don't think so.

86
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,683
- Hey, come on. You don't
have to do that because me.

87
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,517
- No, no. That's okay.

88
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,725
- My name's Linda, Linda Howard.

89
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,892
- I'm Richard.

90
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,017
You staying here?

91
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,142
- Do you know, do they have any vacancies?

92
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,433
- They might.

93
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,267
- On.

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,933
(sighs) Well, you know
I'm not really looking.

95
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:42,100
I've been backpacking on
the road with a friend.

96
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,975
She went off with someone
she met down around the pier.

97
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,933
Didn't come back.

98
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,100
- Well.

99
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:54,892
- I'll be on my way.

100
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,517
You know, all I really
wanna do is take a shower

101
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:05,892
and maybe take a nap in a real live bed.

102
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,892
You think you can help me out?

103
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:11,142
- Oh, well, I, I mean,
I'd like to, I just-

104
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:11,975
- I wouldn't want you to get

105
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,642
in any trouble or anything, you know.

106
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:18,642
I just really need some
real civilization right now.

107
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:21,725
(machinery rumbling)

108
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:32,183
- Hey, Vince, you seen Frank?

109
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,600
- Yeah. About five minutes ago.

110
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,808
Heading towards the hotel.

111
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,933
- Ah, how many times have I told you guys.

112
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,433
(tense music)

113
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:54,183
(eerie music)

114
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,350
(spoon clattering)

115
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:22,600
(machinery rumbling)

116
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,267
- Now that construction next door

117
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,975
would be the new Versailles
Hotel, 119 rooms.

118
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:29,850
- Mm-hm. And a new gambling permit.

119
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,892
The license to steal

120
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,017
with all of America lining up
to kiss their dollars goodbye.

121
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,308
We're not staying here.
I have an appointment-

122
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:53,225
- Tony-

123
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,183
- What?

124
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,517
- This is marvelous.

125
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,725
Why don't we change our reservations?

126
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,892
- What do you mean?

127
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:00,933
- The 11th commandment.

128
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,683
Thou shalt not live in plastic, hm?

129
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:05,850
Why don't we see if they
have a vacancy, okay?

130
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,267
Terrific.

131
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:15,017
- You can go back to town.

132
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,392
Oh, by the way, it's
costing me by the hour

133
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:18,642
so don't stop for a beer.

134
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:28,433
Oh, would you tell Mrs. Adams

135
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,808
Anthony Fleming is here.

136
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:34,017
(people chattering)

137
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:37,017
- Mother, please try and be reasonable.

138
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:38,433
You said you'd meet him.

139
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,017
Didn't you promise?

140
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:44,058
- I know, but I just
can't, I can't see him.

141
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:47,600
- Mother, we've been talking
about this for so long.

142
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,058
I thought you'd made a
decision that you agreed.

143
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:52,058
- I should have the
right to change my mind.

144
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,433
I'm not perfect.

145
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,600
- Mr. Fleming.

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,475
My mother isn't feeling well

147
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,933
and well, I'm afraid

148
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,058
she won't be able to see you, right now.

149
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,892
- Oh, I see.

150
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:20,058
Well, then it's for best
we're staying in the hotel.

151
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:23,683
It'll facilitate our
meeting later today perhaps

152
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:25,892
when your mother's feeling better.

153
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:26,725
- Yes.

154
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:33,392
(parrot squawking)

155
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,433
You're not supposed to be in here.

156
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:44,642
- I'm looking for one of my men.

157
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:46,475
- I don't suppose it has occurred to you,

158
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:50,392
but this is a civilized,
respectable place.

159
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:52,725
You and your men coming
in here trumping dirty in

160
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:55,058
like a bunch of apes, using this bathroom

161
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:57,392
like you would a gas station.

162
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:58,683
- Anybody in here?

163
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,975
What's the matter, Val?

164
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:16,433
- (sighs) You're not supposed
to start work until 8:00.

165
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:18,350
- We didn't.

166
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,308
- Well, you had that big
engine going at 7:30.

167
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,142
- Hey, what's the matter?

168
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,808
- (sighs) Oh, Mike.

169
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:31,142
Mom's changed her mind again
about selling the hotel.

170
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:33,642
She won't even see the man.

171
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:38,017
- (sighs) Well, you got her this far.

172
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:38,850
Just keep trying.

173
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:42,600
- I've got to get her to slow down.

174
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:47,600
She just works so hard
keeping this place going.

175
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,058
(sighs) Well, then we can make our plans.

176
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:54,892
Okay-

177
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,517
- I wanna get it settled.

178
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,725
- Uh huh.

179
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:00,725
- I know it.

180
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,850
Ah, oh. Hi, Mr. Robinson.

181
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,850
Just checking the paper towels.

182
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:18,975
(people chattering)
(machinery rumbling)

183
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,267
- Frank show up yet?

184
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:23,142
- Nah, I ain't seen Charlie either.

185
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:25,225
Huh.

186
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:32,142
(tense orchestral music)

187
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:55,850
- Vince, get everybody fast. Cave-in.

188
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,058
And get some light in here.

189
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,767
- Hey, over here!

190
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,308
Over here, we got trouble!

191
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:01,142
- Hey, man.

192
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:01,975
- Somebody's been hurt said Vince.

193
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,017
Come on!

194
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,850
- Let's go!
- Hey, What's happening?

195
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,933
What's going on?

196
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:09,142
(men shouting)

197
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:10,308
- [Man 1] Let's dig 'em out.

198
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:11,475
- [Man 2] Get this porch off.

199
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,142
- [Man 3] Gimme a hand.

200
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,433
(men shouting)

201
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:17,058
- That's right, haul this stuff from here.

202
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:19,642
(men shouting)

203
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,225
If dirt didn't pack,
they're in an air pocket,

204
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:27,308
they still have a chance.

205
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:31,517
- Hey, you guys, get some
shovels, get some shovels.

206
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,975
(men shouting)

207
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:40,975
(men grunting)

208
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,142
- [Mike] Ha, hey!

209
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,433
They're both here. Get 'em out.

210
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,475
- I told you you should wait
for just the right person.

211
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:56,058
I think this Mr. Fleming just might be it.

212
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,642
There's no real estate syndicate involved.

213
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:00,642
He's independent.

214
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:03,225
He wants to run the place
the way it always has been

215
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,975
and he seems to have the money.

216
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:07,350
- That's not what we're talking about.

217
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,683
- But it is what we're talking about, Mom.

218
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,142
Money and security.

219
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,850
- I can't face leaving.

220
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:17,017
I grew up right here.

221
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:19,558
So many things are part of my life.

222
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,975
That grandfather's clock out there.

223
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:24,933
I remember the day my mother
gave that to my father.

224
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,183
It was his birthday.

225
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:30,725
Stood there with a big
rose-colored blanket over it.

226
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,392
And when she pulled the blanket away,

227
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,017
his eyes filled with tears.

228
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,350
Then it chimed and they
both laughed together.

229
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:43,850
I remember he used to check
the time every morning

230
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:45,642
and set it.

231
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:52,017
- Mother, things change.

232
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,558
The pressures on you now are-

233
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:54,392
- NO.

234
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:56,475
Ralph and I ran Lakewood Manor

235
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:00,933
as it always was, personal
service, handsome rooms,

236
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,683
and what Ralph used to
call a delectable menu.

237
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:08,350
- Mom, Mike has been
offered a terrific job

238
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,475
in San Francisco.

239
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:15,767
I just can't see you here alone,

240
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:18,017
trying to keep this place going.

241
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,142
- I can manage.

242
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,892
- Look, if you sell,

243
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,725
you can make it a
condition of the contract

244
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,642
that there's always a room for you here.

245
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:31,267
That way you can still spend time here

246
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:34,642
and time with Mike and me in San Francisco

247
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,058
and with Aunt Margaret in Florida.

248
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:40,517
- Margaret snores. She always did.

249
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:41,767
Do you know that?

250
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,767
(door clattering)

251
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:47,058
(door slamming)

252
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:48,558
(people chattering)

253
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:50,308
- Yes, yes, a cave-in.

254
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:52,142
We need a rescue unit as fast as possible.

255
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:53,017
- What's wrong?

256
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:54,058
- Val, I've got two men dying out there.

257
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,017
Tell 'em where to send the ambulance.

258
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:55,850
- Oh no.

259
00:15:56,933 --> 00:16:01,017
Yes, operator, 1123 Lake view.

260
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,183
- He ain't breathing, Mike.

261
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:06,517
- Oh, he's just a kid.

262
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:07,517
Keep working on him.

263
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,142
- Get him breathing?

264
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,933
(light knocking)

265
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:21,933
Yes?

266
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,392
- Ready for some lunch?

267
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:30,767
Smuggled it from right under their noses.

268
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,017
- Wow. Cucumber sandwiches.

269
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:39,017
- Right. Only the best.
(sirens blaring)

270
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:45,475
- Looks like an accident.

271
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:48,267
- Stay with him, will you?

272
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,100
- Right.

273
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,058
(brakes screeching)

274
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,350
- Hey-

275
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,433
Come on, down here.

276
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,350
- [Man] Okay, go-

277
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,058
- I wonder what happened.

278
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:13,683
- Makes me dizzy.

279
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:14,767
- What?

280
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,642
- Even from the third floor,
I'm allergic to heights.

281
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:18,850
No, it just kinda freaked me out.

282
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,350
- Close your eyes.

283
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:26,392
Feel better?

284
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:31,558
(gentle music)

285
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,392
I better get back.

286
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:36,392
- Richard.

287
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:41,308
(sighs) Listen, just for
the record I wanna tell you.

288
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,683
My friends didn't run off
and lose me or anything.

289
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,267
I just said that.

290
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,058
- Why?

291
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:53,225
- I wanted to get off
sleeping on the beach.

292
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:55,142
It got really weird and scary.

293
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:59,600
We heard stories about people
getting robbed and hurt.

294
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:03,517
I guess...

295
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:07,642
I just wanted somebody to...

296
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:12,475
who wanna just take me in.

297
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:20,558
(siren blaring)

298
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,267
- They figure Frank will make it.

299
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:27,100
- Yeah.

300
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,725
What were they doing down
there in the first place?

301
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,975
- Hey Mike, it wasn't my fault, okay?

302
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:34,475
- Sorry.
(machinery rumbling)

303
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:37,058
Vince, they must a had a reason.

304
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:42,225
- Yeah.

305
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:44,017
But what?

306
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,933
(tense music)

307
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:48,767
- Come on.

308
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:00,808
(eerie music)

309
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,475
- <i>[Hospital Announcer] Dr.
Kline, paging Dr. Kline.</i>

310
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,683
<i>Telephone please, Dr. Kline.</i>

311
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:27,517
(machine beeping)

312
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,267
- Nothing we can do here.

313
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,683
- All vital signs are deteriorating.

314
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:40,558
He stopped breathing.

315
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:56,225
- Nothing, nothing, nothing!

316
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:59,475
Lungs are good, no broken
ribs, no punctures.

317
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,892
He should be breathing on his own.

318
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:02,725
- Dr. Hawkins!

319
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:05,392
(machine beeping)

320
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:13,142
- Half a milligram of atropine fast.

321
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,892
We're dealing with a toxic
situation, nerve damage.

322
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,183
- [Hospital Announcer] Dr. Karo-

323
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:22,558
- You gonna call Frank's wife.

324
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:24,017
- [Hospital Announcer] Dr. Karo-

325
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:25,392
- You do it, huh?

326
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,225
- Come on.

327
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,767
- Just do it, I can't.

328
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:30,933
- You the family?

329
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,350
- No, but we're it for now.

330
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:34,517
- Charles Hooper.

331
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,808
We couldn't save him.

332
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:38,683
- Oh.
(people chattering)

333
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:42,392
- (sighs) What about Frank?

334
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:43,392
- He's not responding.

335
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:44,683
We don't know why.

336
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:47,767
Complications are confusing,
almost mysterious.

337
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:51,892
- [Hospital Announcer] Dr. Warner.

338
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:56,142
- Was there anything you'd say
was different in that hole?

339
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:57,850
- Like what?

340
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,683
- I don't know.

341
00:20:58,683 --> 00:21:02,475
Some kind of gas, maybe
you severed a pipe?

342
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,225
- There was a drain pipe.

343
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:07,142
- Oh yeah, but that's just water

344
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,975
from the hotel kitchen, nothing else.

345
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,767
- Dr. Nylan, <i>reception</i> area.
- What about a snake?

346
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,517
Well, they're poisonous.

347
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:17,058
That could attack them.

348
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:17,933
- NO.

349
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:23,308
I mean, I don't think so.

350
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,975
- I'd suggest you
give it a closer look.

351
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:26,892
We're dealing with something here

352
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,808
I can't diagnose or treat.

353
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:30,725
- <i>[Hospital Announcer]
Dr. Jones, surgery please.</i>

354
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:31,558
<i>Dr. Jones.</i>

355
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,600
(eerie music)
(machinery rumbling)

356
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:49,225
(suspenseful music)

357
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,433
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

358
00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:07,267
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

359
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:19,183
- Everybody has a soft spot.

360
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:21,683
You find it, you get what you want.

361
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:25,475
- You know, you might offer
her a place to stay here,

362
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:27,058
a chance to stay on for a while.

363
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:28,850
Mm-hm.

364
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,017
Well, I'm glad to see you got a mind too.

365
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:33,850
- Oh, thank you.

366
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:35,892
What was that you were saying

367
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,850
about everybody has a soft spot, hm?

368
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,058
Everybody?
- Uh huh.

369
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,142
- What's mine?

370
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,892
- Oh, um, a handsome man

371
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:47,600
who finds you exceedingly attractive

372
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,767
as well as intelligent.

373
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:54,392
- Oh really? (chuckles)

374
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,808
Come on, let's go get some sunshine.

375
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,225
You know you may be
making so much money soon

376
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,808
you'll never see it again.

377
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:02,808
(people chattering)

378
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,558
- You go find a spot and
I'll get the towels, okay?

379
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,517
- I've never been. Never been.

380
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:16,433
No, I've never been to Europe before.

381
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:19,350
I'd love to though, if
I ever get the chance.

382
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,100
- Hey sonny boy, when you're
through basting the chicken,

383
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,683
give us a hand, huh?

384
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:24,808
- What can I do for you?

385
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:26,433
- Two baloney sandwiches on rye!

386
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,767
What do you think, dammit?

387
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,808
Two lounge pads and towels, huh?

388
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,558
Been standing there for 10 minutes.

389
00:23:33,475 --> 00:23:34,475
We'll be over there.

390
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:41,017
- Unbelievable.

391
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,892
I'd send him the baloney sandwiches.

392
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,850
- And I don't think it'd cure him.

393
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:54,517
- Mom, look! This place
is loaded with bottles.

394
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,933
All deposit free money.
This one's 15 cents.

395
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:00,058
By the time we go home, I'll be rich.

396
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,433
- Tommy, we're not taking these
home. Don't be ridiculous.

397
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,725
- I'm not, I'm not being ridiculous!

398
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:05,850
- All right.

399
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:11,225
(sighs) I'm sorry.

400
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:14,892
Tommy, you don't need to take these home.

401
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:15,767
You don't need them.

402
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,225
- I do. I need the money.

403
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,350
- I don't see what you need the money for.

404
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,433
- To take care of you

405
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,517
now that Dad's not living with us anymore.

406
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,683
- Hey, we will be fine.

407
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:31,100
Don't you worry.

408
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,058
But you go find all the bottles you want.

409
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:35,142
Hey!

410
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,808
Find some for me too, huh?

411
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:41,350
- You gonna tell the guys.

412
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,267
- They'll find out soon enough anyway.

413
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:45,808
- Why don't we just to
go home and get smashed

414
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:46,808
and forget about it?

415
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:50,350
- That's why.

416
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,308
Peggy Kenter, Board of Health.

417
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:56,392
(machinery rumbling)

418
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,308
- Michael McGinn is Carr.

419
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:10,142
This is Lionel White from the
State Department of Health.

420
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,058
- What's up, Peggy?

421
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,767
- After an industrial accident,

422
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:18,308
the law does require a
preliminary investigation.

423
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,600
Come on, Mike, don't play innocent.

424
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,392
- I am innocent. It was an accident.

425
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:25,725
- This where it happened?

426
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:26,558
- Here.

427
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:29,558
- No shoring?

428
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:32,892
Was it posted as dangerous?

429
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,933
- Yeah, we had a sign, "Danger Keep Out".

430
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:38,350
- Is that the sign?

431
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:41,183
- That's where it ended up.

432
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:44,392
I mean, see when we
were digging the men...

433
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,517
One of my men...

434
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,017
- Look, Mike, if you
can prove that your men

435
00:25:49,017 --> 00:25:52,475
were not sent in there, then
you have no major problems.

436
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:53,350
- If you can't,

437
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:57,725
criminal negligence can cost
you more than a license.

438
00:25:57,725 --> 00:26:00,433
- You wanna look around and
ask questions, go ahead.

439
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,892
Every man here will back up the fact

440
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:04,267
that this pit was off limits and posted.

441
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:07,017
Look around, ask questions,
and then beat it, please.

442
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,558
- Look, Mike, I didn't come

443
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,392
all the way over here for nothing.

444
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:15,058
I do have a job to do too.

445
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,017
You stop being your own worst enemy.

446
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,142
(tense orchestral music)

447
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:24,725
Come on, Lionel, let's
go question the men.

448
00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:52,517
(people chattering)

449
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:19,808
(light suspenseful music)

450
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:29,017
(suspenseful music)

451
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:38,558
- Worms.

452
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:44,433
(Mike sighs)

453
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:45,267
Ants.

454
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:51,642
Sea shell.

455
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:54,267
Mike.

456
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:56,017
- Oh, hi.

457
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,267
- Hi.
- Don't come down here.

458
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,642
- Why? What are you doing?

459
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:03,975
- Doctor told me to look
for something down here.

460
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:07,017
- I just wanted to see you for a minute.

461
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:11,225
(suspenseful music)

462
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:35,725
I was worried about you.

463
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:37,142
Okay-

464
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:40,850
- Well, we heard one of
your men didn't make it.

465
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,850
I thought you might
wanna talk or something.

466
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,183
- Listen, Val, I'm glad you came over,

467
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,892
but I think you better
get back to the hotel.

468
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:50,808
- Yeah, sure, okay, Mike,

469
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:51,767
if you can't spend a minute with me

470
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:52,683
that's fine with me.
- Oh now, come on.

471
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:54,558
Don't pout.
- No, no, no.

472
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,558
- We're not even married yet.

473
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,558
(both chuckling)

474
00:28:58,558 --> 00:28:59,933
- You know, things are
beginning to look better

475
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:01,600
in that department too.

476
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,808
Mom seems to be willing to sell.

477
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,892
- Good, good.

478
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,767
(tense music)

479
00:29:14,392 --> 00:29:15,308
- Mom, Mom!

480
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:17,558
Mom, Mom!

481
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,433
Mom!

482
00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:26,808
- Help him! Stop him, please!

483
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,225
He can't swim!

484
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:31,767
Tommy!

485
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,183
- [Man] Help him. Go help him!

486
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:36,933
Help him out. Pull him out!

487
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,225
(people chattering)

488
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:40,142
Hold onto him.

489
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:41,100
- Get some of those towels!

490
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,267
- Some towels.
- Is he all right?

491
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:44,433
(people chattering)

492
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:46,433
- [Man] What's going on?

493
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:49,642
- Call an ambulance.

494
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:53,225
Give us some light. We're
looking for something.

495
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,850
- [Man 1] Anybody know him?

496
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,850
- [Man 2] I saw him run across the side.

497
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:00,558
- [Marjorie] Oh man. Be cautious.

498
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,933
(somber music)

499
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:04,767
- [Man] Are you sure he'll live?

500
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,267
Is everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

501
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:21,308
- They're not sure the
boy's gonna make it.

502
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:24,225
- I was thinking of his mother.

503
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:27,517
She had such a wonderful
smile when she was a child.

504
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:38,058
- [Tony] Go on up to the
room. I'm gonna take my shot.

505
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:38,892
- Good luck.

506
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:45,392
- [Ethel] People don't
die without a reason.

507
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:48,850
The doctors know what it is,
they're just not telling.

508
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,850
- I don't know, Mom.

509
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,683
Did you take your medicine after lunch?

510
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:53,517
- Yes.

511
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:54,642
- -[Tony] Ladies.
(light knocking)

512
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:55,558
I'm not intruding.

513
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,142
- Mr. Fleming.

514
00:30:58,142 --> 00:30:59,600
- I thought this might be a good time to-

515
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,100
- My mother...

516
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,017
- It's all right, Valerie.

517
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:04,475
I'm Ethel Adams.

518
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:07,725
- Very pleased to meet you.

519
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:08,933
- Won't you sit down?

520
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:09,767
- Thank you.

521
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,642
- My daughter seems to have faith in you.

522
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:17,850
- Well, it's very kind.

523
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,308
But to be very honest, I do
believe I'm the right person

524
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,350
to handle this property.

525
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:29,433
It's very special with
a character all its own.

526
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:31,058
I think one actually has to stay here

527
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:33,142
to really appreciate it.

528
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,267
- Well, we like to think
that it's the outgrowth

529
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:39,475
of the taste of our family
for almost a century.

530
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:40,933
- Right.

531
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,892
You can sense it the moment
to walk through the door,

532
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:47,808
such tradition, such faith in the past.

533
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:51,183
I know now's not the
time to talk seriously,

534
00:31:51,183 --> 00:31:54,725
but I did wanna meet you, Mrs. Adams,

535
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,892
to tell you that in the world of plastic,

536
00:31:57,892 --> 00:32:00,683
this hotel has a duty to survive,

537
00:32:01,892 --> 00:32:03,350
to see the next century.

538
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,058
And of course there could
always be a place here for you

539
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,267
if you want, perhaps
on a consulting basis.

540
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,933
Well, enough for now.

541
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,517
When you want, you call me later

542
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,933
and we'll really talk.

543
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,683
- Fine, Mr. Fleming.

544
00:32:27,975 --> 00:32:32,350
Well, I must say he's not
at all what I expected.

545
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,183
- No, he isn't.

546
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:35,767
- I feel much better about things.

547
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:39,975
- Just talked to the hospital.

548
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,600
Frank's holding on, so's the kid.

549
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,933
They're gonna make it.

550
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,892
- Boy, that's good news.

551
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:47,392
- Doctor still wants us
to check out the hole.

552
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:50,475
He thinks it's the same
thing that killed Charlie.

553
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:53,808
On his skin was evidence of rash

554
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,517
or irritation, something.

555
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,933
He's testing out everything.

556
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,308
He seems almost certain

557
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:03,558
that it's some kind of a virus.

558
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:05,517
He's following up on that.

559
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,183
(somber music)

560
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:10,850
It's attacked three people, killed one.

561
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:16,642
Vince, you know what
I'm beginning to think?

562
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:18,392
- What?

563
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:21,058
- Whatever it is,

564
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,100
it's mad because we've disturbed it.

565
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:28,517
The answer must be here.

566
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:30,683
It's got to be.

567
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:37,767
- Well, what if it can attack us?

568
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,183
- What if it can attack everybody?

569
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:53,017
(tense music)

570
00:33:57,725 --> 00:33:59,142
- Gloria! Gloria!

571
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,350
I think she's gonna sell!

572
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,350
And I was terrific.
(Gloria squealing)

573
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,642
Oh, you too.

574
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:08,808
You really helped me, you did.

575
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:09,683
- On.

576
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:11,475
Ah, is it a partnership?

577
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,142
(Tony chuckles)
Oh.

578
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:15,183
- A partnership.

579
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:19,892
- [Gloria] Mm.

580
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:29,183
(somber orchestral music)

581
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:49,975
- Linda, all done.

582
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:53,642
You Okay?

583
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,517
- I'll never forget that boy's scream.

584
00:34:58,017 --> 00:35:01,225
Needing help and there was
nothing anyone could do.

585
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,392
- Yeah.

586
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:06,975
(gentle music)

587
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,017
Listen, I'll be off in a couple hours.

588
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:15,058
Why don't we get outta here for a while?

589
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:16,558
Like the pier.

590
00:35:16,558 --> 00:35:18,225
They got great chili there.

591
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:19,642
Okay-

592
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:22,142
Meanwhile, I think I'll
write my parents a letter.

593
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:25,933
Boy, this place is beautiful.

594
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:43,183
- Doctor asked about some kind of gas.

595
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:47,225
And maybe he's right.

596
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:48,058
Why not?

597
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,642
Some unexpected pocket or crevice.

598
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:56,058
It still doesn't explain the kid...

599
00:35:56,058 --> 00:35:57,808
What's the matter?

600
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:59,433
- They're biting me.

601
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,600
- What do you mean?

602
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,183
- [Vince] They're biting me.

603
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:03,767
These ants are biting me.

604
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,308
Yeah, they hurt. They really hurt.

605
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:07,225
They're biting me.

606
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,642
(Vince grunts)
- Hey, hey, come on.

607
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:10,475
Come on. Here.

608
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:12,475
- On.

609
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:16,600
(Vince grunts)

610
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,225
Whew!

611
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:19,350
- You all right?

612
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,850
- Yeah, I think so.

613
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:25,433
(both exhale heavily)

614
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,892
- Hey-

615
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:28,975
Slowly.
(Vince grunting)

616
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:30,433
- I can't stand up.

617
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:31,267
- What do you mean?

618
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:35,600
- Well, my whole leg is numb. (exhales)

619
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:41,933
- Can you feel that?
(machinery rumbling)

620
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,892
I better call an ambulance.

621
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:44,725
- No, wait, wait.

622
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,183
I'm all right.

623
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:48,975
(tense music)

624
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:49,808
A little woozy.

625
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,267
Let me sit here a minute.

626
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,642
Oh.

627
00:36:55,642 --> 00:37:00,642
(Vince sighs)
(tense music)

628
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:15,767
(Luis humming)

629
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:37,683
(chaotic eerie music)

630
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:55,975
(Luis grunting)

631
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,933
Help-

632
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:08,600
(Luis grunting)

633
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:15,225
(dramatic eerie music)

634
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:30,558
- [Mike] You sure you're all right?

635
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,433
(Vince sighing)

636
00:38:34,433 --> 00:38:35,267
- Yeah.

637
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:37,267
Little woozy.

638
00:38:40,642 --> 00:38:41,767
You know, I felt the first bites

639
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:44,558
and then about five seconds later,

640
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,517
it hit me.

641
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:50,517
(suspenseful music)

642
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,017
(machinery rumbling)

643
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,683
- Luis.

644
00:39:47,392 --> 00:39:50,392
They found him on the kitchen floor.

645
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,392
He's dead, Mike.

646
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,933
- Val, they'd like to talk to you.

647
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,433
- Look, I'm really very sorry,

648
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:15,308
but the kitchen will
have to be quarantined.

649
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:17,017
No one is to enter.

650
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,142
And I'm afraid all of
the guests in the hotel

651
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:22,225
will have to be evacuated
as soon as possible.

652
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:23,725
- Hey, hey, hey, you're blowing smoke.

653
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:24,642
You need a court order and to get it,

654
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,350
you have to show cause.

655
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,433
- Isn't one death all we need

656
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:29,892
and what happened to the boy?

657
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,517
Although the boy is recovering.

658
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:36,517
As to the precise cause,
we're not absolutely certain.

659
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,808
There's something mysterious here,

660
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:40,600
but rest assured we'll isolate the virus.

661
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,433
- I don't think you-

662
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:42,267
- We have been in contact

663
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:43,933
with the Infectious
Disease Center in Atlanta.

664
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,058
We're coordinating our efforts with theirs

665
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:48,767
and hope to be on top of the
situation in a matter of hours.

666
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:51,683
- I think I know what
the cause of all this is.

667
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,808
- Who have you been in touch with?

668
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,600
- Nobody. I figured it
out by what I've seen.

669
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,642
And this may sound crazy,

670
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:59,350
but well, it's what I believe.

671
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,183
Anyway, the problem is
ants, regular little ants

672
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:04,142
like right here.

673
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:05,642
(Lionel laughing)

674
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:07,433
- [Lionel] I don't know
what you're talking about.

675
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:08,808
That's ridiculous.

676
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:09,892
- [Mike] That's what I think

677
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:10,767
and I the-
- The cause of death

678
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:11,600
is a virus.

679
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,433
There's no doubt about that.

680
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:13,267
We hope to be

681
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,058
on top of the situation-
- Ants.

682
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,892
Little damn ants, buddy.
- In a matter of hours.

683
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,808
Have you been in the kitchen?

684
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,350
- No.
- That's where it started,

685
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,308
from a virus.

686
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,350
- Okay, then how do you explain

687
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,933
my men in a pit 80 yards away?

688
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:27,475
- Simple.

689
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:28,475
There's an old drain pipe

690
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:30,225
which runs from the sink here to a sump,

691
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:31,933
no doubt a hundred years old.

692
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:33,892
You severed that pipe with your machines,

693
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,433
the disease thus infested the soil

694
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:36,392
where your men were working,

695
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:38,933
they came in contact with
it, and were overcome.

696
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:39,767
" By What?

697
00:41:41,183 --> 00:41:42,225
- By whatever it is.

698
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:43,308
- No, I've been in the pit,

699
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,225
so have a lot of my guys.

700
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:45,850
We're around and kicking.

701
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,475
So it isn't in the air.
It isn't in the ground.

702
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:50,850
We've touched everything,
even the pipe itself.

703
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:52,850
It's ants.

704
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,183
I don't know how, I don't know
why, but that's what it is.

705
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:56,975
My foreman was bitten by them.

706
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,308
He weighs over 200 pounds.

707
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,517
Nearly knocked him off his feet.

708
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:01,808
- If what you say is true-

709
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:03,058
- It is.

710
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:05,308
- Then we'll find ants in the kitchen.

711
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,725
- But we've always had ants.

712
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:09,392
- Of course, everybody does.

713
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:11,433
Ants are ants.

714
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:12,725
- Not these ants.

715
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:13,558
- After you.

716
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:22,725
Find me an ant.

717
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:25,725
(suspenseful music)

718
00:42:56,392 --> 00:43:00,475
You see.
(tense music)

719
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:03,142
- (sighs) I don't care.

720
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:05,308
I still say here's your
mysterious disease.

721
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:10,433
- All right, if you want.

722
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:12,600
I hope this doesn't
embarrass you too much.

723
00:43:26,683 --> 00:43:28,975
I'm still standing, Mr. Carr,

724
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:30,767
and I don't weigh 200 pounds.

725
00:43:36,725 --> 00:43:38,225
Nothing.

726
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,017
- (stammers) I don't get it.

727
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,933
I don't understand why it
didn't happen just now,

728
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:44,350
but I know what I saw.

729
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,850
- And these ants are supposed
to have caused what happened?

730
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,142
It's a ridiculous theory, Mr. Carr.

731
00:43:49,142 --> 00:43:50,600
It's not ants.

732
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,142
- One of my men is in
the hospital, Mr. White.

733
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:54,767
One's dead.

734
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:57,017
If it isn't ants, then there's
something else in that pit

735
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:58,683
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

736
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:04,142
- Mike, what are you gonna do?

737
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,308
- Test my theory and
hope to God I'm wrong.

738
00:44:09,267 --> 00:44:11,850
(Lionel sighs)

739
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,517
May I?

740
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,767
I'll be back in an hour.

741
00:44:16,808 --> 00:44:19,892
(machinery rumbling)

742
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,350
- Hey, Mike.

743
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:27,725
What you gonna do?

744
00:45:22,308 --> 00:45:27,308
(loud thudding)
(machinery rumbling)

745
00:45:29,808 --> 00:45:32,308
- Do you know what you're doing?

746
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:34,392
My great-grandfather built this hotel

747
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:35,975
a hundred years ago.

748
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:37,517
We have guests who've been coming here

749
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,267
for over half a century

750
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:41,225
and you're driving them away.

751
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:43,767
- And you don't really care, do you?

752
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:45,267
- I am sorry, Mrs. Adams.

753
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,933
We will please inform all the guests,

754
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:50,933
speedily and calmly that they must leave.

755
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:52,517
Some have heard, but some haven't.

756
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:55,267
I expect the building to be
empty and sealed by 5:00.

757
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,517
- In two hours?

758
00:45:57,517 --> 00:45:58,558
- [Lionel] Two hours.

759
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,683
- [Peggy] Is it possible?

760
00:46:03,683 --> 00:46:05,267
Could these things kill people?

761
00:46:05,267 --> 00:46:06,517
- How can I know that, Peggy?

762
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,225
They've gotta be tested.

763
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:10,100
It takes hours, sometimes days.

764
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,350
- (sighs) Wait, Tom.

765
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,683
I mean, ants can't really poison people,

766
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:16,058
I mean, at least the ones
around here, can they?

767
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:19,933
- In Africa, there's a
poisonous specie of ant.

768
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:20,767
Here...

769
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:25,808
- Tom, all I'm asking is is it possible?

770
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:28,600
- Look, Peggy, I've got to
finish this test and do a report.

771
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,517
I don't have time

772
00:46:29,517 --> 00:46:30,933
to sit here and talk with-
- But please just give me

773
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:32,850
the answer, Tom, all right?

774
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,058
Is it possible for those
ants to kill people?

775
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:39,933
(Tom sighs)

776
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:42,058
- 20 years ago the
answer would've been no.

777
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,433
That's before they started
pouring poisons in the air.

778
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:48,558
- You mean all that stuff
we kill insects with.

779
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:49,725
- Exactly.

780
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:53,350
The old way, arsenic, was
simple and unchangeable,

781
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:57,058
but the poisons today are so complicated

782
00:46:57,058 --> 00:46:58,225
they could turn on us.

783
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,558
Anyway, we're the ones who forced them

784
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:03,058
to live in a toxic world.

785
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,642
Why should we be surprised if
they found a way to use it?

786
00:47:10,058 --> 00:47:12,058
I've got something to show you. Come here.

787
00:47:13,058 --> 00:47:16,142
(machinery rumbling)

788
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,308
This should give you some
idea of the possibilities.

789
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,517
Ample food and water will allow colonies

790
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:52,058
to prosper and grow to
massive proportions.

791
00:47:54,392 --> 00:47:58,017
The average ant colony
numbers 20 to 50,000 members.

792
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:02,142
If for some reason this
colony were jostled

793
00:48:02,142 --> 00:48:03,517
by an innocent passerby,

794
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:05,850
the ants would consider it an attack.

795
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,225
Retaliation would be immediate and severe.

796
00:48:09,225 --> 00:48:10,058
- Uh.

797
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,350
- [Tom] A colony of ants
will attack creatures

798
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,975
far larger than themselves
only when they are certain

799
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:20,600
they have sufficient numbers
to overcome their prey.

800
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:24,933
Docile in small numbers,
when there are enough ants,

801
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:28,350
a mysterious chemical signal
sets off savage biting.

802
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,808
- I don't like it.

803
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,892
(machinery rumbling)

804
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,183
(tense music)

805
00:48:57,975 --> 00:49:00,475
(eerie music)

806
00:49:09,683 --> 00:49:12,933
(tense dramatic music)

807
00:49:24,392 --> 00:49:27,475
(machinery rumbling)

808
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:34,017
- You know, if you
bought this hotel today,

809
00:49:34,017 --> 00:49:35,350
we could stay here forever.

810
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,100
- Well, maybe I could afford it

811
00:49:41,517 --> 00:49:43,475
if we sublet the other room.

812
00:49:43,475 --> 00:49:44,433
- Zzz.

813
00:49:44,433 --> 00:49:47,100
(both laughing)

814
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:50,433
(Tony sighs)

815
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:51,475
- If she sells.

816
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:56,767
- We might have told her

817
00:49:56,767 --> 00:49:58,517
how special you thought this place was,

818
00:49:58,517 --> 00:49:59,600
that might melt her.

819
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,058
- Well, what do you think
I told her, I hate it?

820
00:50:02,058 --> 00:50:04,142
I pushed the right buttons.

821
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:05,392
- Hey, I was only trying to-

822
00:50:05,392 --> 00:50:08,058
- Let me handle the business, okay?

823
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:11,517
- (scoffs) Oh, right, partner.

824
00:50:12,517 --> 00:50:13,850
- I only meant that-

825
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,767
- What you meant was that the only partner

826
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:17,975
you really want is a bed partner.

827
00:50:17,975 --> 00:50:19,183
- Oh, come on, Gloria.

828
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,350
Let's not be so touchy.

829
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,933
- You come on, Tony.

830
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:23,808
Why do you think I've been avoiding this?

831
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,600
Do you think I wanted
it any less than you?

832
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,600
- Yeah?
- Come out of the Middle Ages.

833
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,433
(sighs) This is the easy part.

834
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:34,058
Give me a little more
credit than that, okay?

835
00:50:34,058 --> 00:50:35,183
Look beyond all the bumps

836
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:39,308
and you may see that there
is a head up here. (sighs)

837
00:50:39,308 --> 00:50:41,933
- I may not see it, baby,
but I sure do hear it.

838
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:47,600
(Gloria chuckles)

839
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,350
- Partners, bed and otherwise?

840
00:50:52,642 --> 00:50:54,517
- Especially otherwise.

841
00:50:58,808 --> 00:51:01,392
(Gloria sighs)

842
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:05,225
- I really wish I could believe you.

843
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:06,142
- Trust me.

844
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:11,392
I'm gonna build the best
lakeside casino hotel

845
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:13,933
in the world right here.

846
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:19,058
- Oh, you're not gonna tear
this place down, are you?

847
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:20,475
- The week after they sign,

848
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:22,517
we're gonna clams hell it into firewood.

849
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:25,350
(wood clattering)

850
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,725
What was that?

851
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:27,558
- Mm, don't go.

852
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:29,433
- Oh, come on, I gotta see what that is.

853
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:41,975
(chaotic eerie music)

854
00:51:56,558 --> 00:51:59,225
(phone ringing)

855
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:02,683
- Hello.

856
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:03,725
- Hello?

857
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:06,350
This is Ethel Adams, Mr. Fleming.

858
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,767
<i>- [Tony] Yes, Mrs. Adams.</i>

859
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:11,267
- I'm sure you know what's
occurring in the hotel.

860
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,767
- Yes, yes.

861
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:17,267
- Well, I had hoped to
continue our conversation,

862
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:21,433
but in view of what is
happening, I don't think we can.

863
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:25,350
- Well, sure we can, Mrs.
Adams, whatever the difficulty.

864
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,767
- Really? Are you sure?

865
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:30,058
- Of course, I'd still
love to talk to you.

866
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:32,183
<i>- [Ethel] Well, there are some things</i>

867
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:34,017
<i>we could take into account.</i>

868
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,392
<i>The land itself and the
furnishings are worth quite a bit.</i>

869
00:52:37,392 --> 00:52:39,808
- Name your time, Mrs. Adams.

870
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:41,808
- Well, how about right now?

871
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:43,350
- Great.

872
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,267
- So I'll meet you in the music room?

873
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:46,058
- <i>Good.</i>

874
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:52,308
Good news.

875
00:52:59,683 --> 00:53:03,433
(door creaking and thudding)

876
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:13,308
(machinery rumbling)
(dramatic tense music)

877
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,433
(chaotic eerie music)

878
00:54:12,558 --> 00:54:13,517
- Do you have to go?

879
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,225
- Oh, absolutely.

880
00:54:15,225 --> 00:54:17,433
It's time to close this deal.

881
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:18,267
Magic time.

882
00:54:19,142 --> 00:54:21,267
- See you later.

883
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:22,100
Good luck.

884
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:28,433
(door creaking and thudding)

885
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:31,600
(chaotic eerie music)

886
00:54:42,058 --> 00:54:45,058
(people chattering)

887
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:52,933
- We can't get a taxi up here.

888
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:55,642
I told Mrs. Car swell I'd
drive her to the airport.

889
00:54:55,642 --> 00:54:57,642
- All right, Peter, but
hurry back, will you?

890
00:54:57,642 --> 00:54:58,475
Okay-

891
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:01,058
- Richard.

892
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:05,475
Would you take over the desk?

893
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:07,392
I'm gonna see what Mike's doing out here.

894
00:55:07,392 --> 00:55:10,475
(machinery rumbling)

895
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:15,642
(Valerie gasps)

896
00:55:15,642 --> 00:55:18,808
(chaotic eerie music)

897
00:55:22,683 --> 00:55:25,225
(tense music)

898
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:28,392
(chaotic eerie music)

899
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,058

(Gloria screaming)

902
00:56:12,392 --> 00:56:13,725
' <i>Help me!</i>

903
00:56:13,725 --> 00:56:18,725
Help me.
(machinery rumbling)

904
00:56:28,392 --> 00:56:31,600
(suspenseful music)

905
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,767
(chaotic eerie music)

906
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:10,058
- What in god's name does
that maniac think he's doing?

907
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:13,267
- No, not that way!

908
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,183
- Oh!

909
00:57:24,183 --> 00:57:27,017
(Lionel grunting)

910
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,850
(eerie music)

911
00:57:46,392 --> 00:57:49,808
- (whistles) Hey, Vince!

912
00:57:57,392 --> 00:57:58,600
No, no!

913
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,683
Listen, we don't have much time.

914
00:57:59,683 --> 00:58:01,558
This whole area's infested with ants.

915
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,975
- Well, how are you
gonna get the people out?

916
00:58:06,267 --> 00:58:08,433
- I'm gonna try to get
through in this loader.

917
00:58:10,183 --> 00:58:12,392
Get Jerry with a digger

918
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:14,725
and cut a trench around
the pit and the hotel

919
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:16,850
and fill it with water.

920
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,933
We've gotta contain these
ants before they spread out.

921
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,725
- What about the people?

922
00:58:21,725 --> 00:58:23,183
Can they get in that loader?

923
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:26,017
- Go, will ya? I'll be
lucky to get in with it.

924
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:27,142
The ants are climbing fast.

925
00:58:27,142 --> 00:58:29,183
Call the police, the fire
department, everybody.

926
00:58:29,183 --> 00:58:30,892
We need as much help as we can get.

927
00:58:30,892 --> 00:58:31,725
- Right.

928
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:37,558

929
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:41,642

934
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:37,267
(glass shattering)

935
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:55,017
Mike.

936
00:59:56,308 --> 00:59:57,183
Oh.

937
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:59,017
- We'll be okay.

938
00:59:59,017 --> 01:00:00,517
- Mike, they're all around us.

939
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,267
My mother.

940
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,725
How are we gonna get her out?

941
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:09,225
- I don't know.

942
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:19,808
(machinery rumbling)

943
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:41,017
- I'm telling you, Tom, forget your test.

944
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:41,850
We don't need them.

945
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,683
These ants are carriers of poison.

946
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:45,517
- Okay look, what are they
doing to contain them?

947
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,183
- They're digging a
trench around the hotel.

948
01:00:47,183 --> 01:00:48,433
They're gonna fill it with water.

949
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:50,267
- No, no, look, tell them ants can build

950
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:52,517
their own bridge across water.

951
01:00:52,517 --> 01:00:54,183
Tell them they'd be better
off filling the trench

952
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,767
with gasoline and lighting it,

953
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:56,808
containment by fire.

954
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:57,683
Look, I'm on my way
(machinery rumbling)

955
01:00:57,683 --> 01:00:58,850
<i>Out there right now.</i>

956
01:00:58,850 --> 01:00:59,683
- Right.

957
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:04,600
(chaotic eerie music)

958
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:13,267
- [Mike] We'll buy time upstairs.

959
01:01:13,267 --> 01:01:15,225
Pouring in down there.

960
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:17,600
(Ethel panting)

961
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,767
You all right?

962
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,975
(Ethel panting)

963
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:40,433
(Ethel panting)

964
01:01:43,392 --> 01:01:45,225
Stay in the corridor not the rooms.

965
01:01:45,225 --> 01:01:46,058
- Right?

966
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,808
- Do you have any insecticide,

967
01:01:55,808 --> 01:01:58,017
bug Spray of any kind?

968
01:01:58,017 --> 01:01:59,267
- I don't know.

969
01:02:01,142 --> 01:02:04,433
- What about kerosene for
the lamps in the dining room?

970
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:07,225
- Yes. In the cellar, in the storeroom.

971
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,225
(chaotic eerie music)

972
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:13,142
- Let's go.

973
01:02:17,683 --> 01:02:22,683
(sirens blaring)
(machinery rumbling)

974
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:42,058
(people chattering)

975
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:05,142
- Hey, you in charge here?

976
01:03:05,142 --> 01:03:06,058
- No, you are.

977
01:03:06,058 --> 01:03:06,892
When this trench is finished,

978
01:03:06,892 --> 01:03:07,892
we're gonna fill it with water.

979
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:08,725
Now, can you do it?

980
01:03:08,725 --> 01:03:10,558
- There's a three-inch line. No problem.

981
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:13,392
- Excuse me, Chief. Peggy
Kenter, Bureau of Health.

982
01:03:13,392 --> 01:03:14,225
- Yes, ma'am.

983
01:03:14,225 --> 01:03:16,308
- Ants can get across water you know.

984
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,558
- Our reports are of ants-

985
01:03:17,558 --> 01:03:20,100
- Look, I've just been
talking on my car phone.

986
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,808
We've got to fill that
trench with gas or kerosene

987
01:03:22,808 --> 01:03:25,142
and set fire to it to contain those ants.

988
01:03:25,142 --> 01:03:27,892
- Our reports are of
ants that poison people?

989
01:03:27,892 --> 01:03:28,725
Is that right?

990
01:03:33,183 --> 01:03:35,433
- And there are more people in the hotel.

991
01:03:35,433 --> 01:03:37,142
We've gotta get 'em out.

992
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:38,683
- All right, get that hook
and ladder in here right away.

993
01:03:38,683 --> 01:03:39,517
Come on, move.

994
01:03:43,183 --> 01:03:44,017
- [Mike] ls everybody okay?

995
01:03:44,017 --> 01:03:45,517
- There's a lot of
equipment on the street.

996
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:47,142
There's a fire engine with-

997
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:48,475
- What are we gonna do?

998
01:03:48,475 --> 01:03:49,433
- Take this upstairs, will you?

999
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:50,308
- You take it.

1000
01:03:50,308 --> 01:03:52,892

- Mike!

1003
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,017
Look.

1004
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:00,350
We gotta get upstairs.

1005
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:01,183
- Go.

1006
01:04:01,183 --> 01:04:02,558
Oh, listen, before we
abandon on this floor,

1007
01:04:02,558 --> 01:04:03,975
can you operate that switchboard?

1008
01:04:03,975 --> 01:04:04,808
- Yeah, sure.

1009
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:05,850
- Okay, you've gotta patch direct lines

1010
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,308
into all the phones upstairs.

1011
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:14,392
(machinery rumbling)

1012
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,433
- Let's go, let's go.

1013
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:25,267
- Trench is almost ready, Chief.

1014
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:27,558
We're waiting for more gas to get here.

1015
01:04:27,558 --> 01:04:29,267
- Yeah, well, it better be soon.

1016
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:31,892
We can't even light a
fire when we have to.

1017
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:33,475
Come on, get that ladder moving faster!

1018
01:04:33,475 --> 01:04:38,475
Move it out!

1019
01:04:50,308 --> 01:04:52,975
- Mother, they're coming for us.

1020
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:57,475

1021
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:01,058

1023
01:05:03,642 --> 01:05:05,642

1025
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:20,142
Let's get Mother out.

1026
01:05:20,142 --> 01:05:22,350
- (sighs) We can't now.
I'll have to carry her.

1027
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:25,058
- No. You go Valerie, please.

1028
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,183
- Mother, I'm staying right here with you.

1029
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,017
Linda.

1030
01:05:30,017 --> 01:05:30,850
- Huh?

1031
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,350
- [Richard] Heard of ladies first, huh?

1032
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,558
- There's time for all of us. Let me go.

1033
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,933
- You wait with the rest of us.

1034
01:05:43,017 --> 01:05:44,017
- Oh, I can't.

1035
01:05:44,017 --> 01:05:44,850
- You have to.

1036
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,683
- I'm afraid.

1037
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:46,725
- Come on, Linda, you can do it.

1038
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:47,642
You're gonna be fine.

1039
01:05:47,642 --> 01:05:48,475
- Come on.

1040
01:06:10,475 --> 01:06:11,308

1046
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:41,100
Help.

1047
01:06:42,142 --> 01:06:42,975
Oh, oh.

01:07:53,142 --> 01:07:54,558
- All right, all right, good.

1066
01:07:54,558 --> 01:07:56,558
Now, easy with it, now down.

1067
01:07:56,558 --> 01:07:58,142
Easy, take it easy.

1074
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,933
I'm all right.

1075

- The ants!

1076
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:33,183
The ants are coming into the hall!

- Mike, we gotta get outta here. Look!

1078
01:08:39,725 --> 01:08:41,767
- Wait, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

1079
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:43,142
What about the ladder?

1080
01:08:43,142 --> 01:08:44,058
The ladder.

1081
01:08:45,475 --> 01:08:47,892
We have to get to the ladder.

1082
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,308
(truck horn honking)

1083
01:08:58,475 --> 01:09:01,225
(can clattering)

1084
01:09:03,183 --> 01:09:04,308
- I think that ladder down there,

1085
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:06,225
I think it wouldn't extend any higher.

1086
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:10,892
Let's go upstairs. Tony,
help out, will you?

1087
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:11,725
- What?

1088
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:29,517
- There's only one more floor.

1089
01:09:30,683 --> 01:09:33,433
Before it's over, they'll be
all around us, won't they?

1090
01:09:34,725 --> 01:09:36,600
- (sighs) I can't see that far ahead.

1091
01:09:38,017 --> 01:09:39,808
Let's just take it one step at a time.

1092
01:09:42,642 --> 01:09:45,642
(suspenseful music)

1093
01:09:51,475 --> 01:09:54,642
(helicopter whirring)

1094
01:10:38,517 --> 01:10:40,267
- Why'd they land? Why
didn't they come for us?

1095
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:42,892
- Hello, hello? Come on, answer!

1096
01:10:43,725 --> 01:10:46,058
I don't get it. I know
I passed it outside.

1097
01:10:46,058 --> 01:10:48,183
- Mike, she's got to have oxygen.

1098
01:10:48,183 --> 01:10:49,683
- No, I'm all right.

1099
01:10:50,642 --> 01:10:51,767
- Richard.

1100
01:10:51,767 --> 01:10:54,600
(cans clattering)

1101
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:06,058
- This isn't gonna do any good.

1102
01:11:06,058 --> 01:11:07,267
You know that, don't you?

1103
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:09,017
- No, I don't.

1104
01:11:09,017 --> 01:11:11,058
I was a lifeguard once and we had a rule.

1105
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,350
Till you go down for the
fourth time, you keep swimming.

1106
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,933
Got that?

1107
01:11:15,933 --> 01:11:18,933
(people chattering)

1108
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,392
- Come on, get that
gas in the trench fast.

1109
01:11:28,392 --> 01:11:29,517
Let's go, move it!

1110
01:11:29,517 --> 01:11:31,183
Into the trench.

1111
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:32,433
- Get, come on.

1112
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:36,433
(machinery rumbling)

1113
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,225
- Chief, chopper's ready to go.

1114
01:11:41,225 --> 01:11:45,183
- All right, great. Let's
get it in there, come on.

1115
01:11:45,183 --> 01:11:47,267
- Peggy- Peggy, Peggy-

1116
01:11:47,267 --> 01:11:48,850
- Tom. -
(people chattering)

1117
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:49,683
- Let me through.

1118
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:52,517
(people shouting)

1119
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,517
I've had a terrible time finding you.

1120
01:11:55,517 --> 01:11:56,933
- Boy, am I glad to see you, Tom.

1121
01:11:56,933 --> 01:11:58,767
You're the only one with any idea

1122
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:00,808
about this crazy stuff going on here.

1123
01:12:00,808 --> 01:12:01,767
- Not so crazy.

1124
01:12:01,767 --> 01:12:04,433
- Miss, we need communication inside.

1125
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:05,725
Can I use your car hookup?

1126
01:12:05,725 --> 01:12:06,683
- It's yours.

1127
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:27,642
- We're as high as we
can go, the balcony room.

1128
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:30,642
We can't hold out much longer.

1129
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:32,058
The building's like a sieve.

1130
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,100
Okay, we'll be ready.

1131
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,142
They're sending the helicopter.

1132
01:12:37,142 --> 01:12:38,142
(people ehattering)
- What's going on here?

1133
01:12:38,142 --> 01:12:39,850
- Move.
- Step back.

1134
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,642
- [Woman] Let me go.
- [Officer] Back up, people.

1135
01:12:41,642 --> 01:12:42,725
Back, people.

1136
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:43,558
- [Woman] No!

1137
01:12:43,558 --> 01:12:44,392
- [Officer] Step back, please.

1138
01:12:44,392 --> 01:12:45,725
- [Woman] I gotta go down there.

1139
01:12:45,725 --> 01:12:48,850
- See, these ants became immune
to the wastes and poisons

1140
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:52,017
in the air then used them
themselves as a deadly weapon.

1141
01:12:52,017 --> 01:12:53,517
- It's unbelievable.

1142
01:12:53,517 --> 01:12:54,975
- This particular colony of ants

1143
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:56,017
must have been living in earth

1144
01:12:56,017 --> 01:12:59,058
that soaked up poisons for
years then migrated here,

1145
01:12:59,058 --> 01:13:01,225
the perfect breeding
ground, near the water,

1146
01:13:01,225 --> 01:13:03,142
always a dampness in the earth.

1147
01:13:03,142 --> 01:13:04,642
Nature did the rest.

1148
01:13:04,642 --> 01:13:06,058
- It sure ain't natural though, is it?

1149
01:13:06,058 --> 01:13:07,267
- It happened.

1150
01:13:07,267 --> 01:13:11,642
And over the years, this ant
army grew to enormous size.

1151
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:14,058
- Frank, tell that helicopter to hurry up.

1152
01:13:19,517 --> 01:13:22,267
(can clattering)

1153
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,183
- Ants!

1154
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:27,017
It was the last of the kerosene.

1155
01:13:31,642 --> 01:13:34,808
(helicopter whirring)

1156
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:42,308
- See, ants don't sting.

1157
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:43,933
- Yeah, but they have
a stinger, don't they?

1158
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:46,600
- Well, they, not like
bees and other insects.

1159
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,558
They bite.

1160
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:49,350
All their strength, all their being

1161
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,642
is in their mandibles or jaws.

1162
01:13:51,642 --> 01:13:54,767
- So they bite and carry on the poison.

1163
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:58,308
- Which passes directly and
instantly into the bloodstream.

1164
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,642
One bite is harmless.

1165
01:13:59,642 --> 01:14:01,058
50 could knock you down.

1166
01:14:01,058 --> 01:14:02,808
A couple of hundred, certain death.

1167
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:05,058
And once you get them on
you, you can't get them off.

1168
01:14:05,058 --> 01:14:08,642
They have stickers on their
legs that cling to you.

1169
01:14:08,642 --> 01:14:11,808
(helicopter whirring)

1170
01:14:37,475 --> 01:14:38,308
- [Valerie] Mike.

1171
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:42,142
- We'll tie her in. We
have to, she'll be okay.

1172
01:14:45,475 --> 01:14:48,642
(helicopter whirring)

1173
01:15:18,433 --> 01:15:20,600
- They're coming back
for you, aren't they?

1174
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:23,058
- Of course they are, Mother.

1175
01:15:45,058 --> 01:15:46,642
- Well, anchors away.

1176
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:47,725
Good company.

1177
01:15:49,975 --> 01:15:51,058
- Take it up!

1178
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,517
- Mike, it's caught!

1179
01:15:59,392 --> 01:16:03,558
Mike! (crying)

1180
01:16:14,392 --> 01:16:16,892
(tense music)

1181
01:16:25,683 --> 01:16:26,517
- Oh God.

1182
01:16:27,475 --> 01:16:29,142
- Hey, hey.

1183
01:16:29,142 --> 01:16:32,225
Get outta the way, get outta the way!

1184
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:43,600
(machinery rumbling)

1185
01:17:37,058 --> 01:17:39,808
(crowd cheering)

1186
01:17:44,642 --> 01:17:48,642
(people shouting and screaming)

1187
01:17:55,558 --> 01:17:57,767
- The ants, the ants, get outta here.

1188
01:17:57,767 --> 01:17:58,600
Get out!

1189
01:17:59,767 --> 01:18:01,725
Get outta here!

1190
01:18:01,725 --> 01:18:04,642
(people screaming)

1191
01:18:14,558 --> 01:18:17,100
- [Man] The ants'll get!

1192
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,017
(people screaming)

1193
01:18:31,933 --> 01:18:34,017
- Start the pump, start the pump!

1194
01:18:34,017 --> 01:18:36,017
- [Man] The ants'll get.

1195
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:44,142
(fire engine radio chattering)

1196
01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:54,308
The ants'll get.

1197
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:59,350
(people screaming)

1198
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,350
(men grunting)

1199
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:12,558
(Ethel grunting)

1200
01:19:12,558 --> 01:19:14,600
The ants, the ants'll get us.
(siren blaring)

1201
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,433
- On.

1202
01:19:16,558 --> 01:19:18,642
- [Woman] Here they come.

1203
01:19:21,058 --> 01:19:23,975
(people screaming)

1204
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:29,058
- What happened?

1205
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:32,725
- [Man] The ants'll get.

1206
01:19:32,725 --> 01:19:34,683
- Get this under control right now.

1207
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:36,017
All right, we're gonna
get this fire started.

1208
01:19:36,017 --> 01:19:38,058
Now, we're gonna keep these ants inside.

1209
01:19:38,058 --> 01:19:39,808
All right, everybody back off.

1210
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:41,808
Back off. Fire in the hole.

1211
01:19:41,808 --> 01:19:43,433
Fire in the hole!

1212
01:19:43,433 --> 01:19:44,850
Fire in the hole!

1213
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:50,517
(people chattering)

1214
01:20:15,392 --> 01:20:17,892
(tense music)

1215
01:20:17,892 --> 01:20:19,725
- [Richard] Linda!

1216
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:22,475
(romantic music)

1217
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,225
- Hello?

1218
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:31,475
Hello!
- Is there a carton out here?

1219
01:20:31,475 --> 01:20:32,350
- Is there anybody on the line?

1220
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:34,433
- What in God's name are you
doing with that fire out there?

1221
01:20:34,433 --> 01:20:36,350
This place is soaked with kerosene.

1222
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:37,892
- Now, we've got to contain the ants.

1223
01:20:37,892 --> 01:20:39,142
There's no other way.

1224
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,017
We're gonna get you outta
there just as soon as we can.

1225
01:20:42,017 --> 01:20:43,683
- Great. There are three
of us left up here.

1226
01:20:43,683 --> 01:20:44,808
Get the helicopter back.

1227
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:46,017
- No, no way.

1228
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:47,767
No way, it's too dangerous.

1229
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:49,975
The prop wash is blowing
ants all over the county.

1230
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:52,225
- What do you suggest we
do? We don't have much time.

1231
01:20:52,225 --> 01:20:53,475
- Look, hang on, all right?

1232
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:54,433
The Coast Guard is sending us

1233
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:56,267
some special suits, self-contained.

1234
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:58,017
Now, we're gonna come
up there and get you.

1235
01:20:58,017 --> 01:20:59,142
- How long?

1236
01:20:59,142 --> 01:21:00,892
<i>- [Chief] No more than half an hour.</i>

1237
01:21:02,308 --> 01:21:05,225
- Listen, I don't think
we've got five minutes.

1238
01:21:05,225 --> 01:21:06,808
- But the suits aren't here yet!

1239
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:16,850
(Chief sighs)

1240
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:19,517
Now look, you've got to hang on.

1241
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:22,017
Can you hear me?

1242
01:21:23,808 --> 01:21:25,683
- Yeah. I hear you.

1243
01:21:31,267 --> 01:21:33,017
We'll do the best we can.

1244
01:21:33,017 --> 01:21:35,600
(somber music)

1245
01:21:42,267 --> 01:21:44,933
(siren wailing)

1246
01:21:46,475 --> 01:21:48,308
- [Firefighter] Fire service are ready.

1247
01:21:48,308 --> 01:21:52,225
(fire engine radio chattering)

1248
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,225
- Are they okay up there?

1249
01:21:57,225 --> 01:21:58,475
- I don't know.

1250
01:22:00,267 --> 01:22:02,100
I don't hear anything.

1251
01:22:06,183 --> 01:22:08,683
(tense music)

1252
01:22:15,933 --> 01:22:19,100
(chaotic eerie music)

1253
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:48,183
- Here, use this. Don't
let 'em go on your hands.

1254
01:22:48,183 --> 01:22:50,767
- [Tony] They're coming in the door.

1255
01:22:50,767 --> 01:22:51,600
- [Mike] Stop 'em!

1256
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,642
- What? With what?

1257
01:22:52,642 --> 01:22:55,392
- Stuff something under the door.

1258
01:22:57,058 --> 01:22:59,267
- Tell 'em to hurry, please!

1259
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:01,308
(tense music)
(phone ringing)

1260
01:23:01,308 --> 01:23:03,350
<i>- Chief.
- Mike? Mike, is that you?</i>

1261
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,683
<i>Look, is everything all right?</i>

1262
01:23:04,683 --> 01:23:05,808
- You gotta get something up here now.

1263
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:08,017
It's been 20 minutes. Now, come on!

1264
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:10,350
- Look, the suits will be here any minute.

1265
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:11,642
It can't be much longer.

1266
01:23:11,642 --> 01:23:14,308
- If you don't mind.

1267
01:23:14,308 --> 01:23:16,267
This is Tom Franklin,
Department of Health.

1268
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:19,642
Listen, if you do what
I say, you can survive.

1269
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,892
<i>Ants are basically non-aggressive.</i>

1270
01:23:22,892 --> 01:23:25,850
<i>So if you don't move...</i>

1271
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:29,017
(chaotic eerie music)

1272
01:23:30,767 --> 01:23:33,850
- He said if we don't
move or excite the ants

1273
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:35,475
or breathe on them,
then they won't bite us.

1274
01:23:35,475 --> 01:23:38,225
(fire crackling)

1275
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:41,725
So that's what we're gonna try.

1276
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,725
- Oh, you're crazy.

1277
01:23:46,683 --> 01:23:50,350
- I wish I was. I wish
I was in some mad dream.

1278
01:24:01,017 --> 01:24:02,642
Roll this up for a breathing tube.

1279
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,142
Take it!

1280
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,350
- On.

1281
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,267
- Anything?

1282
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:33,392
- Okay. Let's take a deep breath.

1283
01:24:36,517 --> 01:24:37,850
Calm ourselves.

1284
01:24:40,017 --> 01:24:40,850
And believe.

1285
01:24:52,683 --> 01:24:55,600
(Valerie inhaling)

1286
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:02,058
(Valerie exhaling)

1287
01:25:02,058 --> 01:25:04,225
(people shouting)

1288
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:05,350
- Where are those suits?

1289
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,350
- We just got in on our radio.

1290
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,350
They're about two miles away from here.

1291
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:13,350
(Chief sighs)
(tense music)

1292
01:25:14,808 --> 01:25:17,975
- (gasps) Mike, I can't. (panting)

1293
01:25:17,975 --> 01:25:19,142
- Sure you can, Val.

1294
01:25:20,808 --> 01:25:21,892
Just hold on.

1295
01:25:23,933 --> 01:25:26,933
(suspenseful music)

1296
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:38,350
- Mike, I know I won't be able
to stand them on me. (crying)

1297
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,350
- Our only chance is
to stay perfectly still

1298
01:25:42,433 --> 01:25:44,267
and not to agitate them in any way.

1299
01:25:48,392 --> 01:25:50,892
(eerie music)

1300
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:58,017
- They're on my foot, Mike.

1301
01:25:59,642 --> 01:26:01,308
- Val, just hold on.

1302
01:26:05,183 --> 01:26:06,017
Please.

1303
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:08,683
For me.

1304
01:26:09,808 --> 01:26:10,683
- Mike, I'll try.

1305
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:14,183
(eerie music)

1306
01:26:19,558 --> 01:26:20,850
- They're on my foot.

1307
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:21,683
- Don't move.

1308
01:26:23,933 --> 01:26:25,183
Breathe through the tube.

1309
01:26:26,392 --> 01:26:27,642
We can't breathe on them.

1310
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:30,350
Gently.

1311
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:35,475
(eerie music)

1312
01:26:38,267 --> 01:26:40,642
- They're on my hand.

1313
01:26:40,642 --> 01:26:42,142
Like an army on my hand!

1314
01:26:45,642 --> 01:26:46,850
- Remember what he said.

1315
01:26:48,017 --> 01:26:51,558
One bite, several bites, can't hurt us.

1316
01:26:52,558 --> 01:26:53,558
Stay still.

1317
01:26:57,225 --> 01:27:00,975
- They're all over my leg. (whimpering)

1318
01:27:00,975 --> 01:27:02,058
- Don't move.

1319
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,600
(tense music)

1320
01:27:28,392 --> 01:27:31,225
(Valerie panting)

1321
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,433
(people shouting)

1322
01:27:37,433 --> 01:27:40,225
- All right, don't go
heavy on the insecticide.

1323
01:27:40,225 --> 01:27:42,892
Save it for when you reach them.

1324
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:53,100
(tense music)

1325
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,267
(chaotic eerie music)

1326
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:34,975
(Spray hissing)

1327
01:28:39,142 --> 01:28:41,892
(heavy exhaling)

1328
01:29:01,975 --> 01:29:05,142
(chaotic eerie music)

1329
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,600
(spray hissing)-
(suspenseful music)

1330
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:18,058
(tense music)

1331
01:29:39,017 --> 01:29:42,433
(chaotic dramatic music)

1332
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:02,308
(Tony shouting)

1333
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:12,017
(dramatic music)

1334
01:30:19,308 --> 01:30:22,142
(Peggy screaming)

1335
01:30:25,183 --> 01:30:27,892
(Spray hissing)

1336
01:30:27,892 --> 01:30:30,808
(fire crackling)

1337
01:30:30,808 --> 01:30:33,642
(heavy breathing)

1338
01:31:05,142 --> 01:31:08,392
(dramatic eerie music)

1339
01:31:13,808 --> 01:31:16,558
(dramatic music)

1340
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,267
(Spray hissing)

1341
01:31:23,392 --> 01:31:26,058
(somber music)

1342
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,183
- Mike. (panting)

1343
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:08,600
Is that really the sky
up there and we made it?

1344
01:32:11,142 --> 01:32:12,433
I never thought we would.

1345
01:32:14,308 --> 01:32:16,725
- Sure you did. You never gave up.

1346
01:32:16,725 --> 01:32:19,725
(people chattering)

1347
01:32:20,683 --> 01:32:24,558
- Can anybody, anybody
tell me where my mother is?

1348
01:32:25,433 --> 01:32:27,183
- She's all right.

1349
01:32:27,183 --> 01:32:28,350
I'll take you to her.

1350
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:34,808
- Tom Franklin, Department of Health.

1351
01:32:34,808 --> 01:32:35,642
We spoke on the phone.

1352
01:32:35,642 --> 01:32:37,058
- Yeah, thanks. Thank you very much.

1353
01:32:37,058 --> 01:32:37,892
- Sure.

1354
01:32:39,558 --> 01:32:42,683
- Eventually this whole
county's gonna be dug up,

1355
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:43,933
turned over, and rebuilt.

1356
01:32:46,267 --> 01:32:47,933
Will this be happening again?

1357
01:32:47,933 --> 01:32:49,517
- I don't think so.

1358
01:32:49,517 --> 01:32:52,975
Break up the nest, the home,
the special breeding ground,

1359
01:32:52,975 --> 01:32:54,892
the family scatters, losing its force.

1360
01:32:55,725 --> 01:32:57,225
Same with ants as with people.

1361
01:33:05,058 --> 01:33:07,892
- You realize this morning we
hadn't even met each other.

1362
01:33:08,975 --> 01:33:10,350
That seems like years ago.

1363
01:33:11,642 --> 01:33:12,475
- It was.

1364
01:33:13,392 --> 01:33:16,433
- And tomorrow do I get the
terrific chili you promised?

1365
01:33:16,433 --> 01:33:17,808
- Yeah.

1366
01:33:17,808 --> 01:33:20,933
And the day after that too, if you want.

1367
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,183
- Thanks again.

1368
01:33:29,558 --> 01:33:30,392
- Michael.

1369
01:33:32,058 --> 01:33:34,683
Now, you two are going to make your plans,

1370
01:33:34,683 --> 01:33:37,225
get married, do anything you want

1371
01:33:37,225 --> 01:33:38,683
with never a thought for me.

1372
01:33:38,683 --> 01:33:40,725
- Ha ha, that's a tough order.

1373
01:33:40,725 --> 01:33:42,975
- Somebody will buy this land.

1374
01:33:42,975 --> 01:33:45,475
I'm going to Florida to
be with my sister Margaret

1375
01:33:46,475 --> 01:33:48,808
and I forbid you to worry about me.

1376
01:33:48,808 --> 01:33:50,308
- Oh you do.

1377
01:33:50,308 --> 01:33:52,475
And what are you gonna do with your time?

1378
01:33:52,475 --> 01:33:54,600
- I'll think of something.

1379
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,517
I may learn to fly a helicopter.

1380
01:33:56,517 --> 01:33:58,767
(Mike laughing)

1381
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,058
(Valerie laughing)
- You go along with her.

1382
01:34:00,058 --> 01:34:00,892
I'll see you in a while.

1383
01:34:00,892 --> 01:34:01,725
Okay-

1384
01:34:03,267 --> 01:34:08,183
Mike.
(romantic music)

1385
01:34:08,183 --> 01:34:09,100
I love you.

1386
01:34:29,017 --> 01:34:32,767
(emotional orchestral music)

1387
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,100
(lively orchestral music)
