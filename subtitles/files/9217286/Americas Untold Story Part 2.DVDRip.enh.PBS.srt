- Flagler College distinguished
professor of religion

694
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:46,847
Dr. Timothy Johnson has been
working with other scholars

695
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,750
to compare the Spanish
and Timucua versions

696
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,353

religious writings.

- And interestingly enough,
sometimes,

698
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,258
the translations
don't always match up.

699
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,126
There's one story
of a shepherdess

700
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,395
where it's set in the mountains,

701
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,698
and reference to
mountains is eliminated.

702
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,634
Why?
Because there's no mountains.

703
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:07,768
People can't relate.

704
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,471

any great storyteller, right,

706
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,141
like any great preacher
or teacher,

707
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,878
redoes the story so it
resonates with the audience.

708
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,248
- Another example is
from The Confessionario,

709
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:25,186
a document written by Father
Pareja to help friars decide

710
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,889
whether someone had sinned
in the eyes of the church.

711
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,860
- There is a whole series
of what are called superstitions

712
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,295
in The Confessionario,

713
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,897
and the priest is supposed
to ask the Timucua,

714
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,766
"Are you doing this?
Are you doing that?"

715
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,737
One, for example, says, "Do you
take the antlers of the deer

716
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,606
and praying
believe that you will then

717
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,576
be able to catch another deer

718
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,178
as part of this
devil's ceremony?"

719
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,682
So that's the Spanish,
but the Timucua leaves out

720
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,384
any reference to the devil,

721
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,756
so when the Timucua person
puts it into Timucua,

722
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,794
he or she drops the whole
demon part of the text.

723
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,896
- We understood the creator
the same way

724

the creator, the breath-giver.

725
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,303
The conflict came amongst
a lot of tribes

726
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:22,309
when friars would try
to define what the devil was.

727
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:27,882
- You might have ideas of gods
who are evil, gods who are good,

729

that has to do with spirits

insults him, slaps him,

868
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:42,149
which, of course, in the 1660s,
was a terrible breach of honor,

869
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:46,820
and actually orders him
to leave the town.

870
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,656
- But before Pique's ship
reached Havana,

871
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,025
it was captured at sea
by a pirate ship

872

led by the English sympathizer
Robert Searle.

873
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,830
- Now he is a nasty pirate.

874
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,633
He'd probably shoot
his own people.

875
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,969
- Searle and his men
boarded the ship

876
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:05,272
and took his passengers captive.

877
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,908
Pique realized he had
valuable information

878
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,143
that could not
only spare his life

879
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,680
but could also serve to
retaliate against the governor.

880
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,283
He asked for an audience
with Searle.

881
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:19,953
He told the pirate that a
large quantity of silver bars

882
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,788
had recently been recovered
from the wreck

883
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,790
of a treasure ship
off the coast,

884
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:28,962
and it was being held for
safekeeping in St. Augustine.

885
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,897
- And he's feeling vengeful,

886
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,401
and so he gives Searle
all the information he has

887
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:37,137

when the guards might be on
alert and when they wouldn't be,

890
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,945
and so he helps them
get into the town.

891
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,815
- And you better not be lying.

892
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,451

And that was his Trojan horse.
