They fished.

They were pilots, and they were,

- I think that the United States
is richer.

835
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:03,177
Its history is richer
because it demonstrated

00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:07,281
that African and European people
could live together,

837
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:11,252
could benefit
from each other's skills,

838
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,554
and that, as a beginning,

839
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,523

a very different picture

is it's a story

843
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,267
I think it's such

This is centuries of other kinds
of experience, and it...

847

I think it is important
to show that, too.

848

- The location of Fort Mose
at the edge of town

849
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,286

There was no better soldier

to fight hard

854
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,301
- Well, we know that
they're going to fight

855
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,704
and they're gonna fight
to the death

856

857
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:10,377
- The militia at Fort Mose
would soon be tested.

858
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,646
A year after the town
was established,

859
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,816
the largest slave uprising

861
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,354
- On the ground, it's personal.

862
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,823
You know, people who thought
they had slaves...

863
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,725
They're running away to Florida.

ordered Georgia's troops

of harboring runaway slaves.

868

so they had to be wiped out.

870
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,613

Although he was actually
