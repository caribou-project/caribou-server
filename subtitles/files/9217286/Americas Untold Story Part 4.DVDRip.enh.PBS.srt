5
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,051
of a new era
for the British Empire.

6
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,787
For the first time since
Spanish conquistadors

7
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,991

250 years earlier,

was finally under the control
of Great Britain.

10
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,999
- We all know about
the 13 British colonies.

11
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,634
But at the time
of the Revolution,

12
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,170
there weren't 13 British
colonies... there were 15.

13
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,806
Nobody knows that, hardly.

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,277
- Spain had given up
La Florida in 1763

15
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,346
in exchange for recovering
Cuba from the British.

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,318
England created East and West
Florida as royal colonies,

17
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,753
making them the 14th

18
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,221
and 15th British colonies

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,689
in North America,

20
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,659
that would later
become part of the U.S.

21
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,194
East Florida stretched
from the Atlantic

22

West Florida, with the smaller
settlement of Pensacola

reached to the Mississippi.

29
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,243

have been completely

30
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,878

changing of the guard.

The scrappy melting pot
of European, Native,

35
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,092
and black communities

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,296
that had eked out a rough
frontier life under Spanish rule

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,100
had evacuated
to Mexico and Cuba.

38
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,103
And stepping in to govern
the colony of East Florida

39
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,373
was a British aristocrat,
Colonel James Grant,

40
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,909
heir apparent of
Ballindalloch Castle

41
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,178
in the Scottish Highlands.

42
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,781
Grant was literally
of the manor born,

43
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,151
growing up on this 10,000-acre
estate in Speyside,

44
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,154
which has been kept
in the family for centuries.

45
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,191
Many of the rooms
remain as they were

46
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,728
when the castle
was built in 1545.

47
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:35,231
- I always think it's such
a shame the walls can't talk.

48
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,433
'Cause think of
the wonderful stories

49
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,737
that must be in every room.

50
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,940
- Grant left is comfortable life
here to fight for his country

51
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,942
when he was 24.

52
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,444
- He was a very big military man.

53
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,714
He was obviously very bright.

54
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,082
He had a great estate.

55
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,185
He had lots of servants
to look after him.

56
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,221
And he needn't have done that.

57
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:04,093
He could've stayed here
on the estate and done nothing.

58
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,430
- Grant left the lush,
rolling hills of Scotland

59
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:11,367
for the relentless heat
and sandy soil of East Florida,

60
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,203
hoping to transform
this unmanageable territory

61
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,440
into a viable British
trade colony.

62
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,410
The governor of West Florida
was another aristocrat

63
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,912
who had been a commander
in the Royal Navy.

64
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,314
Commodore George Johnstone
had a reputation

65
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,252
for being hot-tempered,
scheming, and duplicitous.

66
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,421
But he was vigorous
about encouraging trade

67
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,456
in the new colony.

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,459
- Here was a subtropical region
that suddenly they had

69
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,027
that might
potentially allow them

70
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,196
to grow some sort of fruits
or vegetables

71
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,198
they would have
to go elsewhere for.

72
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,802
- They saw East Florida
and West Florida

73
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,171
as an extension
of the Caribbean.

74
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:52,909
So they saw
agricultural profits.

75
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,345
- Many of the missing pieces
of the story of British Florida

76
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,750
were hidden in the attic turret
at Ballindalloch Castle,

77
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,819
buried among thousands
of other papers

78
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,255
that had been stored there
and forgotten for centuries.

79
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,991
In the 1970s,
Grant's descendants

80
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,327
asked the Scottish
National Archives

81
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,429
to inventory what was there.

82
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:17,867
A decade later, Dr. Dan Schafer
was allowed access to the papers

83
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,070
and began methodically
reconstructing the history

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,106
of British Florida.

85
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,373
- That's where the records were.

86
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,210
The whole James Grant
letter collection

87
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:31,414
were in the castle
in a far attic,

88
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,051
in the cold, in a room where
they were stored very well,

89
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,121
but nobody knew they were there.

90
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,958
This country, I am convinced
is totally unknown.

91
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,393
- Grant's letters describe
East Florida

92
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,462
as completely undeveloped,

93
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,966
still in a state of nature
when he arrived.

94
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,400
And since only three families

95
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,137
remained after
the Spanish left St. Augustine,

96
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:58,107
Grant had no one to help harness
the wilderness beyond town.

97
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,343
- How are you going to
develop a province

98
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,279
when there's nobody here?

99
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,882
- Grant began by offering
free land

100
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,985
to successful plantation
owners in other colonies.

101
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,419
- He would say,
"We have better climate.

102
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,588
We have better everything
than you have there.

103
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,223
Come here."

104
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,225
- The British-sanctioned
land grants were anywhere

105
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,196
from 100 acres
to 20,000-acre parcels.

106
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,031
- Well, if they come in
to St. Augustine

107
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,835
and find a dismal place
and have a terrible time,

108
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:31,974
they're not gonna come,
so he lit up their night life.

109
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,476
- He was a bachelor.

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,514
And he had one of the largest
collections of wine

111
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,183
in this area.

112
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,185
And by "this area,"
I'm talking about North America.

113
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,923
He had three slaves who were
trained in French culinary arts.

114
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,959
And he threw a party
probably four,

115

But its governor was not
as charismatic as Grant.

147

And the presence of
some 28,000 Natives

Europeans wary of moving there.

00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,149
or food
like they said they would.

178
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:04,086
There's a tremendous
loss of life.

179
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,522
- These are the books
of the burials

180
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,626
of the people of color
at Santa Mosé.

181
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,827
- For several years,

182
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,530
Dr. Jane Landers
of Vanderbilt University

183
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,334
has been tracking the fate
of the residents of Fort Mose

184
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,403
after they arrived in Cuba.

185
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,607
- You can track epidemic disease
through these burial records

186
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,543
and see that so many people
are buried on the same day,

187
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,313
and sometimes they even
tell you what disease.

188
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,283
- Landers is working with a team
of graduate students

189
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,285
to digitize the records.

190
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,188
- We're trying to get as many
of the oldest books

191
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,790
preserved as possible.

192
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,259
As you can see, especially
from that other book

193
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,828
we're working on there,
they're very fragile.

194
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,730
They're old.

195
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,799
They're disappearing as we're
talking and filming here today.

196
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,301
Some of them look like lace.

197
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,569
Climate is a problem.

198
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,171
It's hot and humid.

199
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,505
Bugs are a problem.

200
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,141
So, you'll see worm paths
through the paper.

201
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,876
Fires occasionally.

202
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,412
Sometimes people don't know
what was in those records

203
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,449
and they got tossed.

204
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,552
At one point, there was
no roof on this church,

205
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,754
and everything was
exposed to the air.

206
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,657
They moved the books
to the safest place they could

207
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,859
and they've since
put back a roof.

208
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,662
But all of that damages records,

209
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,731
and some of them
have not survived.

210
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,302
- Landers' team has found that
disease wasn't the only reason

211
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,505
why so many of the refugees
from Florida died here.

212
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,807
- They'd already undergone
so many disruptions.

213
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,376
They'd been moved,
they'd been under attack.

214
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,447
- And some of it may just be
emotional distress, as well.

215
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,749
Especially for the older people.

216
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,253
- And those indigenous tribes
that had gone to Cuba

217
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:48,491
to avoid being enslaved by the
British were also in jeopardy.

218
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,495
- There were 89 Timucua
and Guale Indians

219
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,196
who left with the Spanish.

220
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,123
And within six years,
more than half of them had died.

221
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:03,606
- So Guanabacoa has an important
history also for Florida

222
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,277
as the last resting place
of many of the Florida Indians.

223
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,613
- And as for Francisco Menendez,

224
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:14,650
about a year after he
and his family arrived in Cuba,

225
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,652
the trail goes cold.

226
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,656
- And I'm trying
to track Menendez.

227
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,359
You can see when they give up
their homestead

228
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,396
because you can see them making
payments, and at some point,

229
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,234
they sort of disappear
off of that account book.

230
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,538
- So far, Landers has been unable
to find his grave

231
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,674
in any of the church
cemeteries in Cuba.

232
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,167
We may never know
what happened to him.

233
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,916
Back in East Florida,
illness forced Governor Grant

234
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,785
to return to England
for medical care.

235
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,388
Two years later, he was
elected to Parliament

236
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,256
and resigned as governor.

237
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,294
A new leader was appointed,
Colonel Patrick Tonyn,

238
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,298
who ran into opposition
almost immediately.

239
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:06,769
- He was the nastiest person
I've ever read a letter from.

240
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,470
He hated everybody.

241
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,539
He had a chip on his shoulder
the size of Ireland.

242
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,910
- Such a vindictive nature that
he had, and so self-serving.

243
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,313
I find it really hard
to like the man.

244
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,749
- Tonyn drew resistance
from several of Grant's friends,

245
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,486
including one who publicly
insulted Tonyn's wife.

246
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,590
- He announced, "I will not
allow my wife and daughters

247
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,925
to interact with Mrs. Tonyn.

248
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,695
I knew her in Scotland,
and she was a whore."

249
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:36,465
So the gauntlet was thrown
immediately.

250
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,835
And Tonyn never forgot.
He never forgave.

251
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:44,006
- Several clashed with Tonyn
over the issue of governance.

252
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,575
The colonists believed
they had the same rights

253
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,477
as they had had in Britain,

254
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,749
such as electing representatives
to a colonial house of assembly.

255
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,487
Tonyn viewed such demands
as disloyalty to the Crown.

256
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,624
Former governor Grant
wrote letters back to Florida

257
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,992
assuring his friends

258
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,395
that his successor would
soon win them over...

259
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,630
but he didn't.

260
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,632
- "You predicted that
Governor Tonyn

261
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,634
would bring all into good humor

262
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,637
and drowned animosity
in a bottle of claret.

263
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,773
You're quite mistaken
in your man.

264
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,709
I went to one of
his first parties

265
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,014
and he served bad food
on a dirty tablecloth,"

266
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:31,086
and then continues with, "in all
the comfort of a dirty whore."

267
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,657
- Tonyn lost even more ground
when he began to mistreat

268
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,527
the three domestic slaves he had
promised to purchase from Grant.

269
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,396
- Do you understand me?!

270
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,466
- Alexander, who Governor Grant
had trained to be a prized baker

271
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,603
for all these great affairs,
dinners, that he was having,

272
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,640
was punished by putting
an iron mask around his head

273
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,475
that padlocked in the back.

274
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,644
"Alexander stopped me
in the street.

275
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,913
He complains of the iron caps.

276
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,450
He wishes very much
to be your baker again.

277
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,086
He complains that madame
is the devil.

278
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,822
But since I saw him,
he has had the cap put on

279
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,357
and been flogged."

280
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,659
- Alexander and the two
other slaves

281
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,695
eventually ran away
to the woods.

282
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,530
When Grant heard about this,

283
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:18,701
he insisted that they be given
sanctuary at his own plantation.

284
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,970
- "You are publicly to make it
known that Governor Tonyn

285
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,841
has nothing to do with them,
that they have nothing to fear."

286
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,509
Which is a most
remarkable thing.

287
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,845
To rebuke the other
governor publicly

288
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,814
was a remarkable thing to do.

289
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,083
- But ironically,
just a few years later,

290
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,586
Tonyn would cast himself
as a great liberator,

291
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,422
and in doing so,
he would turn people against

292
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,025
one of his more vocal critics.

293
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,427
That man was
Dr. Andrew Turnbull,

294
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:49,131
who ran the largest plantation
in all of North America.

295
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:53,102
- Turnbull is dreaming big,
big dreams, amazing dreams,

296
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,105
and he had no idea the troubles
that lay ahead of him.

297
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,774
- Educated at the University
of Edinburgh,

298
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,878
Turnbull studied medicine
there when he was only 13.

299
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,048
When the British started
offering land grants in Florida,

300
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,584
Turnbull and his two
wealthy partners

301
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,919
were granted over 100,000 acres.

302
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,456
- There's nothing like that
in colonial American history.

303
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,192
This is just massive
in its scale.

304
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,896
- Turnbull personally recruited
indentured workers from Menorca,

305
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,732
as well as Turkey,
Greece, and Italy.

306
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,468
More than 1,400 people.

307
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,637
- "And I'm going away
as fast as possible,

308
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,774
as the Governor has
taken umbrage at my taking

309
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,876
so many people from his place.

310
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,979
I beg Sir William that you will
not say any of this

311
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,480
until you hear from me

312
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,817
after I've gotten
safely away from here."

313
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,886
If the Turks had apprehended
and jailed him,

314
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,621
he wouldn't have gotten
out of that jail,

315
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,222
or they would've killed him.

316
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,192
- Many of those who signed
on were fleeing famine

317
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,662
and drought in
their own homelands.

318
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,063
- Everything would be
paid for them.

319
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,667
He would provide transportation,
food, provisions.

320
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,737
And once they arrived
in Florida,

321
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,640
then they would begin to work
under contract for him.

322
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,643
They would be
indentured laborers.

323
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,812
- For a while, Turnbull
turned the colony

324
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,181
into a successful
indigo plantation.

325
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,249
- Accomplished on a huge scale

326
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,520
development of plantation-based
economy with export products

327
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,823
that are baffling in size.

328
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,692
- Turnbull was influential
back in England.

329
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,762
When he criticized
East Florida's governance,

330
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,630
Tonyn was reprimanded.

331
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,767
- So there was a real clash
between these two men.

332
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,603
And if you were Tonyn, you would
have some hard feelings

333
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,740
if Turnbull tried to get
you fired, which he did.

334
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,876
- But nine years after it began,

335
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,079
the Turnbull venture
was finished.

336
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,814
- It was a terrible failure,

337
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,717
actually, because about
half of his labor force died

338
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,820
within four years
of leaving Europe.

339
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,691
They faced devastating drought,

340
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,862
hurricane, money shortages,

341
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:03,699
inability to buy things.

342
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,268
- Turnbull's accounts,
as well as his record

343
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,670
of the number of lives lost,

344
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,574
are housed in the Dundee
City Archives in Scotland.

345
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,810
- And it's one of the saddest
of all the documents

346
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,246
that you'll find
in this entire archive

347
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,716
at the Dundee collection.

348
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,623
"Males... 406 left alive.
Females... 296 left alive."

349
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,058
- Within two years after Turnbull
had brought

350
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,693
more than 1,400 people

351
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,864
over from the Mediterranean,
half had died.

352
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,634
The desperation of
his workers grew worse

353
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,870
when Turnbull returned
to England on business

354
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,706
and left his overseers
in charge.

355
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,311
- Increasingly, the behavior
of the overseers and guards

356
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:53,649
toward the indentured servants
was unfair,

357
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,050
approaching on criminal.

358
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,320
The workforce
was just completely

359
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,756
depressed psychologically.

360
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,092
One of the Menorcan group
gather together a couple

361
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:08,330
of other Menorcans and sneaked
out of the encampment one night,

362
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:11,800
walked up the beach
to Anastasia Island,

363
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,670
swam across the river
to St. Augustine,

364
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,372
and approached
the English governor,

365
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:22,377
begging him to do something
to redress their grievances.

366
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,280
- Governor Tonyn seized
the opportunity to get revenge

367
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,952
on this man who had so openly
defied his authority.

368
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:34,156
- Governor Tonyn hated Turnbull
so badly, and the first thing

369
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,727
Tonyn did was he had a notary
taking the sworn affidavits.

370
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,630
- Turnbull was portrayed
as a monster.

371
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,265
- And of course,

372
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,802
he becomes a most hated figure
in British-colonial history.

373
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,839
- The complaints launched against
the overseers included rape,

374
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,774
beatings, and floggings.

375
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,377
- They accuse him of whipping,
that he whipped people.

376
00:18:55,401 --> 00:19:00,816
They accuse him
of starving his laborers.

377
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,019
- The stories were very similar
in the affidavits.

378
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,154
I mean, there were people who...

379
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,856
you know, pregnant women beaten.

380
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,660
There were who had brothers
who were beaten to death.

381
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,997
- And many of these people
were imprisoned.

382
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,832
Some were executed.

383
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:20,869
- Turnbull later defended himself
against these accusations.

384
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,371
- His defense is interesting.

385
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:28,010
His defense is, "Look, if I was
so brutal to them,

386
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,680
how can it be then that
my children and my wife

387
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,049
were not vindictively killed

388
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,851
while I was away
for three years?"

389
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,819
- The infraction Tonyn
was able to get him on

390
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,756
was enslaving white people.

391
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,058
You could indenture them,
but they had a contract.

392
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,993
Contracts have ending dates,

393
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,962
and they swore
in their affidavits

394
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,164
he had illegally kept them
beyond their dates,

395
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,401
and that's where Tonyn said,
"I've got him."

396
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,737
- Turnbull maintained he would
have honored his contract

397
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,406
once the debts were paid.

398
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,341
The court agreed with him.

399
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,879
Nevertheless, Turnbull's alleged
brutality became legendary,

400
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:07,082
and his plantation was
eventually closed down.

401
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,118
- Governor Tonyn,
a very vindictive man,

402
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,189
and at the end he had
Turnbull thrown in jail.

403
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,160
He came out on bail and left
the province as a result.

404
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:23,765
But surely, each person is
guilty of arrogance and haughty,

405
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,334
vindictive behavior
it seems to me.

406
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,805
- Despite how Tonyn had treated
his own African slaves,

407
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,908
he now set himself up
as a great liberator

408
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:36,812
by freeing Turnbull's
indentured servants.

409
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,982
Several were too sick to leave,
but with Tonyn's blessing,

410
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,452
about 500 of them
came to St. Augustine

411
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,287
and made their homes there.

412
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,389
Most of them were Menorcan.

413
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,225
- And there they
have been ever since.

414
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,095
From their ranks
have come mayors,

415
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,863
two bishops,

416
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,066
two great literary figures,
Stephen Vincent Benét

417
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,969
and his brother
William Rose Benét.

418
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,240
They've had a very distinguished
and long career in the city.

419
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,910
- But by this time, Tonyn and the
rest of the British colonies

420
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,213
had bigger problems
to contend with.

421
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,570
The American Revolutionary War
had begun.

422
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:20,822
The Boston Tea Party had
taken place in December 1773,

423
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,993
just a few months before
Tonyn arrived in Florida.

424
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,330
For the next year,
as unrest boiled to the North,

425
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,299
Tonyn kept a watchful eye
on his citizenry.

426
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,803
- He was here to keep this colony
safe for king and country.

427
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:39,174
- He was caught in the war almost
within months of his arrival.

428
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,377
But he had such
an aggravating personality

429
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,013
that people of importance
became the enemy,

430
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,515
and as he saw them,

431
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:50,152
they were part of the American
revolutionary mentality.

432
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:55,323
- Both East and West Florida were
the newest of the royal colonies

433
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,126
and had been tightly
controlled by the King

434
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,262
and by Parliament ever since.

435
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:04,566
- Had it been an older colony,
the kinds of grievances

436
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,870
rebels are talking about
in Georgia and South Carolina,

437
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,973
might well have been
in East Florida as well.

438
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,178
But the population that comes in
is settled in so late,

439
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:19,514
most of the people who were
there had very strong,

440
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,450
deep ties to England,

441
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,619
and they had not developed

442
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:30,058
those sort of self-governing
institutional ties.

443
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,194
- Meanwhile, the colony
of West Florida

444
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,095
was dealing with other problems,

445
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,598
as the War of Independence
loomed.

446
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:40,135
It had gone through numerous
governors since it began.

447
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,003
Once of them, John Elliot,

448
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,507
hung himself just a month
after he arrived there.

449
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:49,110
West Florida was hardly
ready for independence.

450
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,079
- I think that East
and West Florida

451
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,547
have been written out of
the historical narrative

452
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:57,152
because they remained loyal
to the British Crown

453
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,154
during the Revolution.

454
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,489
And so they just
don't quite fit in

455
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,961
to that story
of the American patriots.

456
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,197
- And so it was sort of
like phantom pain

457
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,398
from an amputated limb...

458
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,500
Nobody paid attention to it,

459
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,236
and nobody claimed it
for a long time,

460
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,441
and yet it's a politically
important place.

461
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,409
- Much has been written
about the conflicts

462
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,645
fought in the 13 colonies

463
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,514
and the help the rebels
got from the French.

464
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,117
But little is known
about the pivotal role

465
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,653
that battles along the
Mississippi and Gulf Coast

466
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:35,223
played in turning the tide
of the Revolutionary War,

467
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,995
or the vital part Spain had in
supporting the American cause.

468
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,530
- It's just as much a part
of American history

469
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,499
as Washington
crossing the Delaware

470
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,083
or Paul Revere's ride.

471
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,242
- As iconic as the steeple
of the Old North Church,

472
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,313
this unfinished tower on
the Cathedral in Málaga, Spain,

473
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:02,317
stands in silent tribute
to the part it played

474
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,552
in the American
fight for freedom.

475
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,422
- [Speaking Spanish]

476
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,624
- Because the money
the Málaga town council

477
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,327
was to use to finish
this tower was sent

478
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:17,299
instead to help fund the
American War of Independence.

479
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,368
- During the Revolution,
Spain secretly funneled money

480
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,570
to the Americans
through this man,

481
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,707
Bernardo de Gálvez,
a native of Málaga,

482
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,277
who was the Governor
of Spanish-held Louisiana.

483
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,147
Donations came from
all over Spain.

484
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,684
The Cathedral's tower remains
unfinished to this day,

485
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,286
as a lasting tribute
to that effort.

486
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,754
- It's a great story.

487
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,390
Even on the level of the
common man and the common woman,

488
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,560
you're seeing support
for what's going on.

489
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:50,498
- By 1777, Gálvez had sent
an estimated $70,000

490
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,000
worth of medicine, weapons,

491
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,536
and ammunition
to the American rebels.

492
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,341
But in 1779, when Spain
declared war on Great Britain,

493
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,778
Gálvez was free to openly
defend the American cause.

494
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,747
He gathered recruits
from Mexico,

495
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,616
free blacks from Cuba,
Native Americans,

496
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,687
Spanish soldiers, Germans,
and Acadian French.

497
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,023
- Gálvez had a huge army.

498
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,558
Huge.

499
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,761
And it was one that was
multicultural in its makeup,

500
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,496
multi-ethnic.

501
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,767
- And this fleet full of
black sailors and militiamen

502
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,637
who helped win the independence
of the United States of America,

503
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,273
not memorialized, usually.

504
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,110
Except we find them
in the Spanish records.

505
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:38,213
- By 1780, the British
had taken Charleston

506
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:42,050
and blockaded the port cities
along the East Coast.

507
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,352
- The British war effort
in the War of Independence

508
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,588
is entirely based on the sea,

509
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:50,458
and eventually they
capture key port cities

510
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:55,296
basically to control the
economic life of the colonies.

511
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,831
'Cause there's no way
of getting all those goods

512
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:01,136
that you're producing out
into the world trade system.

513
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,072
So what the British are saying,
"We hold Charleston.

514
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,141
If you want to trade,
trade through us."

515
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,543
- Gálvez knew the Mississippi
was a vital route

516
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,146
that circumvented
the British blockade.

517
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,215
He led attacks on the British
forts along the Gulf,

518
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,685
taking Baton Rouge,
Natchez, and Mobile,

519
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,454
but Pensacola

520
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:23,191
was the most formidable
British bastion on the coast.

521
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,428
- Washington makes a statement
that much depends

522
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,229
on what happens in Pensacola,

523
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,166
that he is placing great value
on what is happening

524
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,269
Gálvez's efforts as he moves
towards Pensacola.

525
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,705
- On his way there, Gálvez lost
more than half of his troops

526
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,307
to a hurricane.

527
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,243
Then several of his officers
refused to cross

528
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,847
a shallow channel
to get to shore.

529
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:49,150
- He stood up in the prow
of his ship and stated,

530
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,386
"I alone will take Pensacola."

531
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,789
The rest of the ships followed
after this display of courage,

532
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,826
and the siege
of Pensacola began.

533
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,862
- The Battle of Pensacola
lasted two months,

534
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:05,366
one of the longest conflicts
in the American Revolution.

535
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,137
- And in taking Pensacola,
this was the big prize.

536
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,372
He effectively
shut down anything

537
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,375
that could have happened
from the British front

538
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,611
along the Gulf Coast
of the Mississippi.

539
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,645
He was brilliant.

540
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,748
- [Speaking Spanish]

541
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,585
- The siege of Pensacola
was a decisive battle,

542
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,487
as it made it impossible
for the British

543
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:30,458
to attack from the rear
any of the 13 colonies.

544
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,728
- I think had there not been
the protection from the rear,

545
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,365
that Washington would've had
a much harder uphill climb

546
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,902
in what he was doing
on the Atlantic seaboard.

547
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:44,372
So yes, I think that this was
a pivotal event

548
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,742
in the American fight
for independence.

549
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,812
- The importance of that battle
has not been fully acknowledged

550
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,547
in textbooks.

551
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:55,216
The siege not only kept
the British occupied

552
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,651
on a second front,

553
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,287
but also affected
the number of troops and ships

554
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,522
the British sent

555
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:03,791
just two months
later to Yorktown,

556
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,395
the final battle
in the War of Independence.

557
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,264
- And after the loss of Yorktown,

558
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,900
the British recognize
there's no way back from this.

559
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,269
"We have enough power
to defend the West Indies,

560
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:17,272
the sugar islands,
the Caribbean trade,

561
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,707
or to carry the war on
in America."

562
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,409
And it's a no-brainer.

563
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,380
- Back at that time,
sugar was the oil of the day.

564
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,715
Sugar afforded empire.

565
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:32,287
So the British West Indies
were the most crucial lands

566
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,589
in the British Empire
at this time,

567
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:37,559
so the number-one priority
of the British Empire

568
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,460
during the American Revolution

569
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,530
was not to allow the Revolution
to distract them to the point

570
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,834
that they could lose an island
down in the Caribbean

571
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,436
to the French or the Spanish.

572
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,971
- So they started to move
those people

573
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,641
into positions
outside West Florida,

574
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:59,814
outside the 13 colonies so they
can hold what they still have.

575
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,884
- East Florida became the haven
for thousands of loyalists

576
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,453
leaving the colonies.

577
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,457
- East Florida is designated
as a haven for refugees

578
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,526
from Charleston,

579
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,462
from anywhere
in the American South,

580
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:19,500
and 13,000 to 14,000 refugees
pour in.

581
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,603
- They migrated all over
the province,

582
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:25,506
setting onto estates
that had not yet been developed.

583
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,375
History books
have largely ignored

584
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,011
those thousands of
loyalist families forced

585
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,834
to leave their homes
at the end of the war.

586
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,053
But the recent discovery
of a shipwreck

587
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,656
off the coast of St. Augustine

588
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,625
paints a very human picture

589
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,245
of what those men, women,
and children experienced.

590
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,601
- You see these artifacts
and you can't help

591
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,471
but think about the people
who use these artifacts

592
00:29:56,495 --> 00:30:00,942
and what a turbulent period
in their life this was.

593
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,510
- Chuck Meide is director of

594
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,046
the Lighthouse Archeological
Maritime Program,

595
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,348
also known as LAMP.

596
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,817
Meide and his team
believe this wreck

597
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:15,456
was transporting loyalists
from the fallen 13 colonies.

598
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,492
- Remember, these people
were living

599
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,394
through just perilous times.

600
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,795
War was raging around them.

601
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,597
They were about to
lose their country.

602
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,066
They had fought for king and
country, and now all of a sudden

603
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,335
they have to gather
their families up.

604
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,737
- What happened to these
people on their way

605
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,541
to the one last colony
that was still loyal to England?

606
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,910
- The story is also just
unfolding right beneath us

607
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,846
on the sea floor as we pick
it apart piece by piece.

608
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:45,119
♪♪

609
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,423
- It's a story that would take
these marine biologists

610
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:52,694
all the way to the British
National Archives in Kew.

611
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,830
- I came back from the archives
with more than 1,000 pages...

612
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,032
Correspondence, a list of ships.

613
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,569
So it just paints
a great picture for us

614
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,471
of what was going on.

615
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,374
- It's actually very interesting
because all of these logbooks

616
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,742
make note of the weather.

617
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:11,646
- Dr. Sam Turner is LAMP's
director of archaeology.

618
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,582
- And what that weather
data tells us

619
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,918
is that there was
a nor'easter brewing.

620
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:20,121
- It was New Year's Eve, 1782.

621
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,757
A fleet of 16 British ships

622
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,892
filled with refugees
from Charleston

623
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,395
was sitting off the coast
of St. Augustine

624
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,464
hoping to cross the bar.

625
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,898
They needed to get
into the harbor

626
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,634
before American
privateers attacked.

627
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,970
- Pirates were out there
trying to pick off ships.

628
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,806
And we know the very fleet
that our ship

629
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,610
was a member of was
being chased by privateers.

630
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,780
- Among the hundreds of documents
the pair combed through

631
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:49,016
was a diary of a German soldier
in the British Army.

632
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,019
- He describes his journey
down from Charleston.

633
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,590
He describes themselves
as being flung about pitilessly.

634
00:31:55,614 --> 00:32:00,609
The shipmaster was very nervous
about crossing the bar.

635
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:03,998
- St. Augustine had a reputation

636
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,900
for being
the most dangerous inlet

637
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,170
of all the other British
colonies in North America.

638
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,038
And as they sailed in,
you could see

639
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,774
the wooden remains of shipwrecks

640
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,042
jutting out on either
side of the channel

641
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,613
where ships had been
lost before.

642
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,783
- "The chances of getting across
are terribly slim

643
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,719
and we're all
probably gonna die."

644
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,954
And there's wreckage everywhere.

645
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:31,159
It's all flung up on the beach,
half buried in the sand.

646
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:35,029
It's out on the bar.

647
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,831
- To add to the problem,

648
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,701
the British ships were far
too laden for a shallow inlet.

649
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,805
- When we look at some of these
tonnages, they're extreme.

650
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,173
335.

651
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,008
384.

652
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,676
365.

653
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,144
They are not gonna be able to
get across the bar

654
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,813
at St. Augustine.

655
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,581
- They knew like,

656
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,016
"This isn't the time to
try to get into St. Augustine.

657
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,784
We're gonna wait until
we have a better tide."

658
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,853
- And there's a nor'easter
blowing.

659
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,688
It's a recipe for disaster,
really.

660
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,790
- They are waiting offshore
and the captain

661
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,827
finally dares
to cross the sandbar...

662
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,961
bam!

663
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,696
The ship is run aground.

664
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,566
The surf is pounding
on the ship.

665
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,067
It's coming to pieces.

666
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,870
All of their possessions
are spilling out into the sea.

667
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:19,640
I mean, just within less than
a mile of safe refuge,

668
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,776
their hopes and dreams
are being dashed to pieces,

669
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,635
just like the ship that they
thought was their salvation.

670
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,853
- LAMP's divers have pulled up
a wide array of artifacts

671
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,221
from the storm wreck,

672
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,623
including a flintlock pistol,

673
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,860
two loaded Brown Bess
muskets, six canons,

674
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,630
and the intact ship's bell.

675
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:45,733
But the most remarkable
artifact was one that

676
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,069
instantly transported Meide

677
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:51,539
back to the final moments
of the ship's demise.

678
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:52,940
- The visibility was zero,

679
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,910
as it usually is
offshore St. Augustine,

680
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,613
so we're really in the dark
just feeling this object.

681
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,148
And it was round,
and I could feel a lip to it

682
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,750
and put my hands inside,

683
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,919
and then I realized what it was.

684
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,654
- It was a cooking pot,

685
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,957
which led the archeologists
to a chilling revelation.

686
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,894
- In one of these cooking pots,
one of these iron cauldrons,

687
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,296
we had the remains
of the last meal

688
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,098
that was prepared in that pot.

689
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,800
This is something that has
not seen daylight in,

690
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,203
as it turns out, 228 years.

691
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,804
So that's a pretty
special thing.

692
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,339
I mean, you're the first
person to touch it.

693
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,941
The last person to touch it

694
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,176
did so under very different
circumstances,

695
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,013
probably in those
chaotic moments

696
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,881
in the middle of this tragedy,

697
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:38,052
when the ship was wrecking and
was going to be lost forever.

698
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,788
- A year after the last
of these loyalists

699
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,790
arrived in St. Augustine,

700
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,059
the Revolutionary War was over.

701
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,764
The British period in Florida
had lasted merely 20 years.

702
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,366
- "What shall become of
the thousands of poor loyalist

703
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,235
settlers who are now here

704
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,904
and were just made
comfortable and happy,

705
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,607
astonished by the crops
in the ground?"

706
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,176
- In the short time
the English had been there,

707
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,946
the loyalists had
turned a barren land

708
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,081
into a viable trade area.

709
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,017
But they were about
to lose it all.

710
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,386
As a reward for Spain's
contributions

711
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,221
to the American cause,

712
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:19,060
East and West Florida became
Spanish territory once again.

713
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:22,697
Among those chosen to draft
the Second Treaty of Paris,

714
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:27,101
ending the Revolutionary War,
was Bernardo de Gálvez,

715
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,970
the Spanish hero
who had defeated

716
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,862
British troops
along the Gulf Coast.

717
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,379
And now that the territory
was back in Spanish possession,

718
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,682
many of those survivors
who had fled to Cuba

719
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,151
to escape British rule returned.

720
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,855
Most of them were just children
when they'd left.

721
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,258
- They're sending back certified
copies of deeds to prove

722
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:55,262
that they owned property in
St. Augustine in the 1760s.

723
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,398
- But even though
the British were gone,

724
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:01,002
slavery in the new
United States remained.

725
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,905
Runaway slaves began heading
to Spanish Florida again,

726
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,874
hoping for asylum.

727
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,377
- And Thomas Jefferson
is our Secretary of State,

728
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,113
and he writes to the Spanish
government and says,

729
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,882
"If you still want
to be friends with us,

730
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,219
you will shut down this
sanctuary and this policy."

731
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,754
Spain agrees.

732
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,023
Spain is under a lot
of duress at this point.

733
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,959
Rebellions all over
its wide empire.

734
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:29,397
- So in 1790, Spain reversed
its century-old edict

735
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,166
offering sanctuary
for runaway slaves.

736
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,301
- They have to post announcements
everywhere that

737
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:38,706
"no longer will we receive
and free runaway slaves."

738
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,442
The royal policy was now
officially closed

739
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,045
thanks to Thomas Jefferson.

740
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,347
- But that didn't stop
the animosity

741
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,282
between Spanish-owned Florida

742
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,718
and its American neighbors
to the north.

743
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:54,889
Slaves still ran south,
but this time they sought refuge

744
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:58,859
with Seminole Indians in the
backwoods of Spanish Florida.

745
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,496
- The reason that the people
became known as Black Seminoles

746
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,800
was because they were allies.

747
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,235
- South Georgia
plantation owners later

748
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,972
claimed over $5 million
worth of slave property

749
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,008
was lost during this time.

750
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:17,411
They sent bounty hunters
to get them back.

751
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,815
- And most of the time,
their autonomous communities

752
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,951
were formed in very
inhospitable areas,

753
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:28,889
in swamps, where it was
difficult for the slave catcher

754
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,491
to come and get them again.

755
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,060
- Adding to the tensions
with the United States,

756
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,362
the Spanish began
offering inducements

757
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,031
to move to its colonies.

758
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,367
- You know, no taxes,
fair amount of land.

759
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,903
Originally they wanted people
to convert to Catholicism.

760
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,872
That was a stopping point
for many people

761
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,874
that were Protestant by faith.

762
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,375
But they dropped that provision.

763
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,177
They said, "No, all you have
to do is you have to take

764
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,314
an oath of loyalty to the King,
the Spanish King."

765
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,417
- For those who doubted
the United States would succeed,

766
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,452
it was an attractive offer,

767
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,021
particularly for
British loyalists

768
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,224
who had lost their land
during the war.

769
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,260
- Their business was commerce,
their business was planting,

770
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,129
and they wanted land again.

771
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,132
- The increased revenue that
Florida was enjoying from trade

772
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,135
with Europe
also stirred resentment.

773
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,206
- Florida was trading like
wildfire with Great Britain.

774
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,041
And that angered a lot
of the Georgians.

775
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,377
They were like,
"If you look at the Spanish side

776
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,313
of the St. Marys River,
it's all full of British ships.

777
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,982
And if you look at
our side of the St. Marys River,

778
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,850
there's nobody."

779
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:33,354
- Moreover, Americans worried
that their southern-most border

780
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:35,890
was not well protected.

781
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,124
- The St. Marys River

782
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,193
that divides Georgia and Florida
today,

783
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,295
that was an international
border at the time.

784
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,497
You were in one country
on one side,

785
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,399
a different country
on the other side.

786
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,435
In the late 1700s and 1800s,

787
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,404
you couldn't stop people
from coming in

788
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,873
and out of Florida or Georgia.

789
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:57,044
And sometimes they were coming
to seek revenge on someone

790
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,446
they had a long-standing
grudge against.

791
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,883
So that whole area was almost
like a no man's land.

792
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:08,989
Georgians raided
and Floridians raided back.

793
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,459
- It was a time
of complete lawlessness.

794
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,929
- I think Florida was always
the Wild, Wild West.

795
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,430
I think we could've
taught the West

796
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,599
how to be the Wild, Wild West.

797
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:22,303
- And the beginning of the 19th
century brought more trouble.

798
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:25,272
In 1800, Spain lost Louisiana,

799
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,175
which bordered the Florida
colonies to the West.

800
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,946
It remained a French colony
until Louisiana was purchased

801
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,082
by the United States
three years later.

802
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,285
On the world stage,
the Battle of Trafalgar

803
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,654
destroyed much of Spain's navy.

804
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,924
The Napoleonic Wars
took a devastating toll,

805
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,894
throwing the country
into an era of turbulence.

806
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:51,599
Spain could not send
much aid to its colonies.

807
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,968
The volatile tensions
between the U.S.

808
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,604
and Spanish Florida
came to a head

809
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,540
just before the War of 1812.

810
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,109
As America was preparing
to declare war

811
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,011
over trade restrictions,

812
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,982
they feared that the British,
now allies with Spain,

813
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,251
would stage troops
in St. Augustine.

814
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:13,654
- So we need to seize
these Spanish port towns

815
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:18,259
now before we have the British
navy sailing into them.

816
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,160
- Many Americans felt it was time

817
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,397
to seize the territory
for the United States.

818
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,100
Former Georgia governor
George Mathews

819
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,669
created a private army
and headed to Florida.

820
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:32,006
He called his troops
the Patriots.

821
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,343
In March 1812, this force
of more than 200 men

822
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:41,148
seized the East Florida port
of Fernandina on Amelia Island.

823
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,218
- This insurgent group moves
in and the very next day,

824
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,719
they raise the American flag

825
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,955
and they ask the American Army
and the American Marines

826
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,291
to come take control
of the town,

827
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,392
which they do.

828
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,560
- It was known as
the Patriot War,

829
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,496
and it's one of the most
overlooked events

830
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,165
in early 19th century history.

831
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,100
With Fernandina secured,

832
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,972
the Patriots headed south
to capture St. Augustine.

833
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,708
- So by April, there's actually
an American force

834
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,711
just north of town,
up where Fort Mose used to be.

835
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:15,416
And when they get there,
the Madison government retracts,

836
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,020
quickly, any support
for what they're doing.

837
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:23,057
- News of the Patriots' move
against Spanish Florida

838
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:26,360
took the Madison administration
by surprise.

839
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,330
Military preparations for war
had been focused

840
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,332
on the northern border
with Canada,

841
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,300
not the southern one.

842
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,737
President Madison did not
want to provoke Spain.

843
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,606
He refused to publicly
support the seizure.

844
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,508
- But the U.S. government
does not make a move

845
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,277
to pull the troops out.

846
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:46,080
- The American troops were told
to hold their position,

847
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:50,551
avoid a confrontation,
and defend if attacked.

848
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,286
Inside the Castillo,

849
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,357
Governor Sebastián Kindelán
gave similar orders.

850
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,092
- "Don't attack the Americans.

851
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:01,729
Because if you inflict
an injury on those troops,

852
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:05,766
there will be 10,000 more troops
coming down for vengeance."

853
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,334
- It was a standoff.

854
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,336
Unable to capture St. Augustine,

855
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,706
the Americans tried
to starve out its population.

856
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,775
- American officers were
given the instructions

857
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,543
to kill the cattle.

858
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,313
Because that way, Spanish forces
can't drive them into town

859
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,048
and use them for food.

860
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:24,284
And people said that
for miles around St. Augustine,

861
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:29,523
there was just a stench
of dead, rotting animals,

862
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,325
and that everywhere you went,

863
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:37,765
you saw dead cattle lying on
the banks of the various rivers.

864
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:40,601
- Meanwhile, the Patriots looted
and burned the homes

865
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,958
of anyone sympathetic
to Spanish rule.

866
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,443
- And so the destruction
all around this area

867
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:52,413
was just unbelievable.

868
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,549
- Incensed by the destruction
throughout the area,

869
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,086
the Seminoles and Black
Seminoles took up arms.

870
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,489
They stormed the plantations
occupied by the Georgia Patriots

871
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:03,824
and destroyed them,

872
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,794
liberating hundreds
of plantation slaves

873
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,596
who then joined their ranks.

874
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,700
But the people of St. Augustine
were barely holding on.

875
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,237
- The Governor is actually
counting down the days

876
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,540
to when he will
have no more food

877
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:23,177
and no real chance of survival.

878
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,847
And ironically, what breaks that

879
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:30,217
is a very small contingent
of men from St. Augustine,

880
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,352
all free blacks.

881
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,389
- It was a militia of
about 60 free blacks,

882
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,424
led by a 6' carpenter

883
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,327
and former slave known
as "Big Prince" Whitten.

884
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,730
- Prince Whitten was a slave and
who became kind of a war hero.

885
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,166
- He was the leader
of the free black militia

886
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,768
in the later period.

887
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,338
- He and his family had escaped
from St. Marys, Georgia,

888
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,675
four times before they
successfully made it to Florida.

889
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,444
They had been granted freedom
just two years before

890
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,315
the Spanish stopped giving
sanctuary to runaway slaves.

891
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,650
- But this family takes
on a very important role,

892
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:09,289
including beating the U.S.
Marines in a covert operation.

893
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:14,361
- It's the black militia that
goes out on a raiding party,

894
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,796
realizes that
the American troops

895
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,332
are almost in the same shape.

896
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,167
They're hungry, too.

897
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,636
'Cause they're not getting a lot
of supplies down from Georgia.

898
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,606
- The black militia, along
with a band of Seminoles,

899
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,510
lay in wait at a place
called Twelve Mile Swamp.

900
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:32,880
When American troops send out
a convoy to get supplies,

901
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:35,482
Whitten and his men ambush them.

902
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,518
- And pin them down,
seize the wagons,

903
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,586
and force them
basically to turn back

904
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,422
or to flee for safety
to the St. Johns River.

905
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,191
And the American commander,
when he finds out

906
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:48,228
that that has happened,
retreats.

907
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,465
- It was another victory
for the people of Florida,

908
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:55,402
but it would be the final
victory for Spanish Florida.

909
00:44:55,426 --> 00:45:00,807
The attack at Twelve Mile Swamp
only fueled America's anger.

910
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,211
Newspapers and politicians
in the Southern states

911
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:08,282
called for these Native and
black militias to be punished.

912
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:11,685
- They could not have
blacks with guns

913
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:16,557
and giving hope to
people on plantations

914
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,826
that they too could join them
and get their freedom.

915
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,330
- After Seminoles ambushed
another American supply convoy

916
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,765
a few years later,

917
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,968
General Andrew Jackson
led a retaliatory attack

918
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,704
known as the First Seminole War.

919
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,574
It was 1818.

920
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:37,311
Meanwhile, the entire Spanish
Empire had been collapsing.

921
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,846
Major colonies were
declaring independence

922
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,316
and breaking away from Spain.

923
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,818
- So, you have, during
the Second Spanish Period,

924
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,789
the complete and utter collapse
of the Spanish New World Empire.

925
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:51,458
Argentina has gone its way.

926
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,360
Peru has gone its own way.

927
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,862
Mexico gains its independence.

928
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,465
- No longer a dominant
European power,

929
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,634
Spain could not
keep its territory

930
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:03,470
from constant conflict.

931
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,006
Secretary of State
John Quincy Adams

932
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,743
demanded that Spain either
control its Florida colonies

933
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,312
and their defiance
on the issue of slavery

934
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,449
or cede the territory
to the United States.

935
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,918
- All the trouble that came
from the War of 1812

936
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,354
destabilized the area so much,

937
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,623
I think it made
the acquisition of Florida...

938
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:23,991
The transfer of Florida
to the United States,

939
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,926
I think it made it inevitable.

940
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,428
- In February 1821,

941
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,398
the Adams-Onís Treaty
made Florida

942
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,834
a territory
of the United States.

943
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,770
- When the Spanish gave
up Florida in 1821,

944
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,071
almost immediately the Americans

945
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,741
begin to turn
to the problem of Indians

946
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:42,342
and how to get them out.

947
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,645
The 1820s is a period
of extreme racism

948
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:46,713
against American Indians
in the South.

949
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,616
- The Native population that
had thrived in the region

950
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,351
for 12,000 years

951
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:55,756
before the Europeans arrived
was now nearly extinct.

952
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,759
A small remaining group
of Apalachees

953
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,927
migrated to Louisiana.

954
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,598
The Yamasees, who had long been
believed to be extinct,

955
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:08,935
had scattered throughout Florida
and South Carolina to survive.

956
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,872
- To be Indian in Florida
was dangerous,

957
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:14,541
so they would hide themselves.

958
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,710
- We went back to
our traditional ways

959
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:18,512
of hiding our women and children

960
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,814
because we saw that they valued
the women and children.

961
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,083
- So that's where the swamp
became our friends.

962
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:27,087
But it kept us alive,
and it kept us here today.

963
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,690
- And we'll see moments
in the 19th century

964
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:33,727
as white Americans are trying
to make all Indians extinct,

965
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,128
that they begin to say,

966
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,365
you know, we see here
the last of the Yamasees.

967
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,967
So it leads to this notion
that they are gone,

968
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,036
that they have become
conquered, right?

969
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,472
But they didn't.

970
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,907
- So we became known
as the hidden people

971
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,375
because that's what we did.

972
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,810
We hid mostly
amongst other tribes.

973
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,813
A lot of us have been
identified as Cherokee.

974
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:55,949
Some of us identified
as Seminoles.

975
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,886
- Andrew Jackson was appointed
Governor of the territory.

976
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,757
The U.S. began efforts to
relocate the Seminole Indians,

977
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,959
eventually to
present-day Oklahoma

978
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,062
where other Southeastern
tribes had already gone.

979
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:13,800
- They are removed through
deception, through force,

980
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,535
into Oklahoma,

981
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,672
and then several hundred,
probably 250 or 300 Seminoles,

982
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:22,409
will not go and they will
hide out in the Everglades

983
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,078
and they will stay there
until the early 20th century,

984
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,448
sort of withdrawn
from American society

985
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,117
because they distrust
them so much,

986
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:33,186
and they will create their own
communities in the Everglades.

987
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,555
- And as for the hundreds
of escaped slaves

988
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,491
known as the Black Seminoles,

989
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,626
most of them fled
to the Bahamas.

990
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,530

the next exodus in 1821,

is gonna take Florida.

992
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:49,703
And he leads his
community into exile.

993
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:54,441
- Because the United States
brought their form of slavery

994
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:58,678
and ideas about black people
right down into Florida.

995

00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,009
then I think that would create

1035
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:14,047
a whole different atmosphere
in this country.

1036
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:20,320
- We're looking at questions
of race, religion, diversity.

1037
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:22,055
I think it’s very important
to recognize that

1038
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,325
at a certain period of time
in American history,

1039
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:28,361
there was a place where
different groups came together

1040
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,698
and were able to live
with each other despite,

1041
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:34,100
or because of, their
incredible diversity.

1042
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:37,871
- It wasn't always
easy and peaceful,

1043
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:40,941
but multiculturalism
has been part of the U.S.

1044
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,777
for a long time.

1045
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:46,913
- Will school kids
in Boston and Virginia

1046
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,748
learn about the Spanish

1047
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,352
who were here before the other
Founding Fathers we know of?

1048
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:55,355
I don't know.
That remains to be seen.

1049
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:58,725
- I would like the rest
of the United States

1050
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,227
to accept it as part
of the history,

1051
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,997
as a part of the credible,
believable history,

1052
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,832
that it belongs in the history.

1053
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:10,804
It's not an anomaly like,
"Oh, that's Spanish."

1054
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:14,374
- As the very base of it,
it's a pretty good story.

1055
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:17,644
It has all these great
implications for, wow,

1056
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,980
this is a history that we've
forgotten or under-appreciated,

1057
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:25,085
but, man, at the foundation
of it, it's just a great story.

1058
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,988
- It's good to have a narrative
of persistence, you know?

1059
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:29,889
We will survive.

1060
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,691
We will be strong.

1061
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,893
We will have problems.

1062
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,830
We may even have our towns
burned down from time to time,

1063
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,332
but we will rebuild
and we will carry on.

1064
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,435
That's a powerful story
for any country to have.

1065
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,404
It's a powerful narrative.

1066
