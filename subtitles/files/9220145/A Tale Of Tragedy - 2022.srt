1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,959
Not my hand only,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,100
but my mouth.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,159
Not my mouth, but my heart, also.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
Granted, that I may know nothing but you.

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,110
Count the blessings ...

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,599
Amen.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,500
Yes.

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,279
I know that my redeemer liveth,

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,118
and He shall stand at the latter day

10
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,359
on the earth.

11
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,919
And though after my skin, worms destroy

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,599
this body.

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,239
Still in my flesh shall I see God.

14
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,118
Whom I shall see for myself.

15
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,279
And mine eyes shall behold.

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,160
And not another.

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
Amen.

18
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
Amen.

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
Amen.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,878
Sister Adana?

21
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,520
Amen.

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,559
- I fear I can't, sister -
- Sister Adana,

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,719
we are in the midst of prayer.

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,639
In the midst of paying respect to our

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,639
- late Sister Irene.
- I'm mean no

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,160
disrespect to Irene.

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,958
Your actions speak the contrary.

28
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,319
Amen, Adana.

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,999
But I fear a misjudgment in our faith.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,919
What has brought you to these

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,639
- twisted perceptions?
- I'm sorry sister but

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,719
I know I lack the confidence

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,639
of His control.

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,999
Causing an uncontrollable spiral.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,079
Watch what you say in moments

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,359
of weakness!

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,359
Times like this

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,479
are our real test.

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,279
This is a test which I feel I am not

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,399
failing.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,559
I cannot explain with
any reason what -

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,479
Father, forgive her.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,999
She does not know of what she speaks.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,798
The deeper I think of these events

45
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,080
the emptier they become.

46
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,759
We must trust what He does

47
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,479
that it is for the greater good.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,320
We may only understand so much.

49
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,199
Trust,

50
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,080
must do the rest.

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,279
And this is why second by second,

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,919
- my faith weakens --
- Adana.

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,759
I hope God will never suffer you to come

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,158
to this disorder again.

55
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,199
Adana, may speak some truth.

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,598
To have one look upon these events

57
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,878
would trouble any soul mightily.

58
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,438
I fear darker spirits are playing.

59
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,919
You must stop this talk.
If you were to seem

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,759
fit to live.

61
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,319
The Lord will serve what we deserve.

62
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,398
Cast upon our souls the rightful

63
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,719
- judgment from our Father.
- The stories

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,399
which we study often tell a common tale.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,198
One of unexplained deceit.

66
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,159
A name which I dare utter.

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,918
Finding new ways to terrorize souls.

68
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,279
This tale,

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,679
could be the thick and corrupt web of

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,519
which Horus -

71
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,359
Fall in line.

72
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,159
Or find yourself burning in the eternal

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,959
punishment of neglect!

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,999
Never,

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,239
endeavor to be transformed like

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,240
this again.

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,800
I've done what you asked of me.

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,399
My loyalty

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,039
knows no bounds.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,799
Your wish

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,519
is my...

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,560
Please, come quick!

83
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,319
Father.

84
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
Sister.

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,159
How long have you shared my presence?

86
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,559
You shouldn't fear, sister.

87
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,758
Not now,

88
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,918
and not tomorrow.

89
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,520
Your youth has gotten the better of you.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,879
Come to me, sister.

91
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,598
Let us repent your soul.

92
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,878
For your way has been lost.

93
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,359
I fear I'd no longer belong here, sister.

94
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,119
Your path to rediscovery is being

95
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,159
revealed as we speak.

96
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,720
Come to me.

97
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,038
Listen, sister.

98
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,240
And open thy soul.

99
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,520
Oh, Lord forgive our Adana.

100
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,759
Take her.

101
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
Forgive her.

102
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,479
Her faith is strong.

103
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,639
I forgave

104
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,678
I forgave, my trust.

105
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,678
- I wavered
- I wavered
- I have sinned,

106
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
but

107
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,840
- I love
- I love.

108
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,800
Endeavor to be transformed, sister.
