1
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:27,960
THEY SAY
NOTHING STAYS THE SAME

2
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,609
Thank you.

3
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,311
I'll need a ride back...

4
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,785
at around sunset.

5
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,726
Boatman!

6
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,706
Hurry up!

7
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,770
Move it!

8
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,754
Faster, boatman!

9
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,786
Right away.

10
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,463
Hurry!

11
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,231
Thank you for waiting, sir.

12
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,469
Watch it!
You're in my way.

13
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,671
Get going.

14
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,745
Yes, sir.
Right away.

15
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,606
Off we go.

16
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,617
You can barely row!

17
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,718
Give me a ride.

18
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,564
Don't go back.
I'm in a hurry!

19
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,157
I'm sorry, but it's the rule.

20
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:58,000
What rule?
There are no rules for boatmen.

21
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,073
Just take me across!

22
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,675
Get a move on!

23
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,577
Get in, let's go.

24
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,706
Sorry. This thing's so heavy.

25
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,945
Stop fumbling around!

26
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,851
- Sorry to stall you.
- Go, boatman!

27
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,656
Faster, you incompetent fool

28
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,025
You're so clumsy.

29
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,074
Here.

30
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,202
Thanks.

31
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,247
You wasted my time!

32
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,151
I caused you trouble, Toichi.

33
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,118
I delayed you.

34
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,815
What an arrogant man he is!

35
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:57,226
I don't know him.
Maybe he's from upstream?

36
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,796
I bet he's involved...

37
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,168
in building the bridge.

38
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,072
All that banging is so noisy.

39
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:13,179
Hey, Toichi,
have you eaten?

40
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,805
Not yet.

41
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,646
I've been ferrying people non-stop.

42
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,777
I got potatoes upstream.
Want some?

43
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,118
Don't worry.
Go home and eat.

44
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,850
It's okay!

45
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,156
It's always better to eat with someone.

46
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,992
Let me cook them here.

47
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,329
You're so kind.

48
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,870
It's so heavy!

49
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,306
Hey, I want to cross.

50
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,940
Yes, sir.

51
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:00,924
Get in.

52
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,026
Thank you.

53
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,254
Toichi, here.

54
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,956
Thank you, sir.

55
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,763
Let's see what I shoot.

56
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,302
I'll be back.

57
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,029
Have a nice hunt, sir!

58
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,306
This'll make it even.

59
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,010
What's that?

60
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,348
My passenger...

61
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,154
Nihei gave me them.

62
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:08,126
That means I won't owe you anymore.

63
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,821
I lost out...

64
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,256
These look better!

65
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:25,711
Hot potatoes on a hot day
is hellish!

66
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,186
There they go again.

67
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,191
Are you okay, Toichi?
Doesn't the noise bother you?

68
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,327
I guess I got used to it.

69
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,268
Not me.

70
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,399
You know, Toichi.

71
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,812
When the noise is unbearable,
I think I'll destroy that bridge!

72
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:07,385
That bridge will be bad for you, tool

73
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:13,517
The villagers say
it'll be convenient,

74
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:17,991
but they're wrong.
I don't think it'll be good.

75
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:24,197
You've ferried people
over the river for years.

76
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,401
That's how we've always
got upstream.

77
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:31,979
Why change it?

78
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:39,019
I know the bridge
will be convenient...

79
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:44,281
but then we won't need
your boat, Toichi.

80
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,052
That's wrong.

81
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,323
It's just wrong!

82
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,365
Toichi.

83
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,463
Join me.

84
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:04,238
Let's destroy the bridge
before it's done.

85
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:09,339
I can't tell if you're fooling.

86
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,443
Me neither!

87
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,046
I'm not very smart.

88
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:32,146
...so I thought it was a boar!

89
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:38,316
I was shocked
when he jumped out of the bush!

90
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,484
I'd shoot, too.

91
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,361
Lucky I'm a bad shot.

92
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:47,765
He'd be dead if I wasn't.

93
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,503
Is he okay?

94
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,402
His ear was scorched

95
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:56,033
so he was in a daze for a while.

96
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,577
He would be!!

97
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:03,411
Thank God, he was quicker than a boar!

98
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:09,529
Damn, that noise!
The fish got spooked.

99
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:17,401
River hobos!

100
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:20,742
<i>Get out of here, scum!</i>

101
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:24,284
Eat this and die!

102
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,648
You brats!
Cut it out!

103
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm going to eat you up!

104
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,550
You stupid brats!

105
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,927
Those kids are hopeless.

106
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,495
I want peace and quiet.

107
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,882
We need to cross!

108
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,447
Look at that bull!

109
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:02,954
Let me help.

110
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:06,283
Be care full

111
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,632
It'd be easier if there was a bridge.

112
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:21,674
Come on, this is nothing.

113
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,300
Right, Toichi?

114
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,744
We'll go where the water's shallow.

115
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:34,885
Come on.

116
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,956
Steady, boy.

117
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:41,793
- That's the way.
- Good boy!

118
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,355
This way.

119
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:46,661
Come on.

120
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,866
You can do it.

121
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,665
Let's go.

122
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,701
You okay, Genzo?

123
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:01,413
- Are you okay?
- Yes, it was no trouble.

124
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,051
We made it!

125
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:08,554
I thought I was stuck,
but you made it possible.

126
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,487
Your bull got wet.

127
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,754
It'll dry on our way upstream

128
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:18,355
in this heat!
And its hide is silkier.

129
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,694
Let's go.

130
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,000
It feels nice!

131
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,797
It'll be another hot day.

132
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:05,129
It's such a desolate village.

133
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,936
There's nothing there.

134
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:11,739
You from there, Mr. Boatman?

135
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,677
No, I'm not.

136
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,876
I came from another village upstream.

137
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,612
Right.

138
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Well, I guess you had
your reasons for leaving...

139
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:25,991
Something like that.

140
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:30,553
Right. I knew that was the case.

141
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:35,194
Don't you want to go back?

142
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:39,205
I have no family or relatives there.

143
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:42,071
I don't think I'd belong.

144
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:47,542
I know what you mean.

145
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:55,019
Do you know the Chinese
character for loneliness?

146
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,524
Uh... no.

147
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:02,152
Oh, okay. Never mind that.

148
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,594
Don't be embarrassed.

149
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,537
The character for loneliness
is similar to fox.

150
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:18,202
There are foxes around here, right?

151
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:21,612
Foxes, raccoon dogs and even bears.

152
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:24,207
I bet.

153
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,911
So...

154
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:30,786
foxes always seem lonely to me.

155
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,719
Isn't that strange?

156
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:39,858
You're right.
I guess foxes are lonely, too.

157
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:49,100
Mr. Boatman, I was sold
as a child so my family could eat.

158
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:52,110
I worked for a medicine maker.

159
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:56,274
They had many books,
so I learned to read.

160
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,613
Good for you.

161
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:02,280
I was born very sturdy.

162
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,357
I've never been sick.

163
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:09,959
I sold medicine,
but I never needed any!

164
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:17,298
I did okay for a child who was sold off.

165
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,268
Even so...

166
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:27,177
I've become sentimental
about the old village.

167
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,319
I thought I'd never go back but

168
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:37,880
I keep thinking about the past lately.

169
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,653
Isn't that funny?

170
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:45,798
So I went back to the village...

171
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:52,096
but there's nothing for me there anymore.

172
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:03,292
What? A kid was drifting
in the river?

173
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:07,834
The boat hit something
and it was a human.

174
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:09,869
Let me check.

175
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:13,865
A person?

176
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:18,172
I thought she was dead,
but she was breathing.

177
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:21,179
I did what I could.

178
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:25,517
What the hell!

179
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:28,213
I need more mugwort.

180
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:31,622
Is there any around your place?

181
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:33,359
Yes, there isl!

182
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,863
So...

183
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:38,622
I'll get some!!

184
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,024
Thanks.

185
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:41,431
Okay!

186
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,300
Okay! I'll be right back!

187
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,872
Mugwort. Mugwort, mugwort...

188
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,281
Hey, Toichi.

189
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,219
She looks better.
Her breathing's steadier.

190
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:43,228
That's good.

191
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,628
Your mugwort medicine worked!

192
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:47,462
That's right.

193
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:51,163
It works very well.

194
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:53,603
She'll be well soon.

195
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:59,303
But I worry that she hit her head.

196
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:04,647
You're right.
She was bleeding around here.

197
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:09,388
We don't know how far she floated.

198
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:15,020
If she got a bad blow to the head,
mugwort won't help.

199
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,557
Boatman! I need to cross!

200
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,024
Yes, sir.

201
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:54,329
- Stop fishing!
- I'm sorry.

202
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,061
Hurry up!

203
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,508
You're vain,
that's what you are.

204
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:08,013
Lay off! I got laid.
That's all that matters.

205
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:14,014
<i>You splashed me!
Don't rock the boat.</i>

206
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:19,456
Careful, you idiot!

207
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,795
Bad things happen.

208
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,729
Imagine having your throat slit!

209
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:37,271
I heard that you squeal
like a wild beast and die.

210
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:41,569
- You make sounds?
- It's more like air releasing.

211
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:43,837
It's terrible.

212
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:47,114
The entire family was killed...

213
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:49,706
It was some kind of grudge.

214
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:53,219
Right. He even killed the children?

215
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,290
Merciless bastard.

216
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,587
Did you hear about it, Boatman?

217
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:04,893
No. Only what I heard you say now.

218
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,758
Is that right?

219
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:10,826
There's a village called Ichi-nomiya,
20 kilometers upstream.

220
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:12,872
It's a spooky place.

221
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,198
No one told you about it?

222
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:17,175
Rumors have legs, right?

223
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,473
What happened?

224
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,244
Apparently a whole family was massacred.

225
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,681
Throats slit.

226
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:28,221
Yes, they were slit, it was savage.

227
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:31,451
Ichi-nomiya is creepy!

228
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:33,390
It's horrible.

229
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:37,795
The killer is at large.

230
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:40,492
Oh, wait.

231
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:44,663
I heard that a boy or girl...
is missing.

232
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:47,833
The killer might have taken one of them.

233
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:50,603
After killing the rest?

234
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:56,673
However it went, it's cruel.
Everyone's talking about it.

235
00:36:57,818 --> 00:36:59,183
I see.

236
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:13,763
Toichi!

237
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:15,335
She's awake!

238
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,440
She's awake but she won't
say a thing!

239
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,704
She won't answer my questions.

240
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:25,870
When did she wake up?

241
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:30,940
A while ago. While you were
taking someone across.

242
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:32,582
<i>How did it go?</i>

243
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:36,350
How? She just sprang up!

244
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:38,653
I was surprised.

245
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:43,356
I think there was a "Whoa" or "Ugh"|

246
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:46,434
She said, "Whoa" and "Ugh"?

247
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:47,898
No, me! I did!

248
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:52,235
I was so surprised I said, "Ugh"!

249
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,808
I'm not talking about you, Genzo.

250
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:55,773
Right.

251
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:59,676
She sprang up and looked around...

252
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,612
Then she stared at me.

253
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:07,779
Okay. I'll go see how she is.

254
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,752
<i>Toichi, I have to go!</i>

255
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,623
Okay, thank you.

256
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:38,849
Are you...

257
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,750
okay?

258
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:46,659
I...

259
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,559
I row a boat.

260
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,763
I'm a boatman.

261
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:56,358
And...

262
00:38:57,805 --> 00:39:00,035
I found you.

263
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:02,905
So...

264
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:09,474
you can rest here
until you feel better.

265
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:08,802
Are you hungry?

266
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:11,470
Here...

267
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:14,378
Eat this.

268
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:22,477
Remember what I told you
about the Ichi-nomiya massacre?

269
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:28,716
It wasn't the son who was kidnapped.
It was the daughter.

270
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:30,483
A girl!

271
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,491
Either way it's horrible.

272
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:41,065
You must ferry across
many people every day.

273
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,829
That's right.

274
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:46,634
You might have taken the killer!

275
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:51,137
Watch for anyone with a girl.

276
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:53,737
When did it happen?

277
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,179
A couple of days ago.

278
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:23,354
Are you okay now?

279
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:27,200
You look well now...

280
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:29,999
thanks to my medicine.

281
00:44:39,713 --> 00:44:44,810
I mix mugwort with bear bile.

282
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,055
Do you...

283
00:44:55,095 --> 00:44:57,325
remember drifting in the river?

284
00:45:01,235 --> 00:45:03,329
I bet your family's worried.

285
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:10,774
Why were you floating in the river?

286
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:22,847
What's your name?

287
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:26,292
You remember your name?

288
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,834
Did you come in a giant peach?

289
00:45:50,784 --> 00:45:54,311
She won't even tell me her name.

290
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:58,053
Maybe she can't remember?

291
00:45:58,158 --> 00:45:59,785
Beats me.

292
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:03,262
She stares at the river.

293
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,127
Yes, all the time.

294
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:10,395
Toichi.

295
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:15,402
Is that girl on the rock related to you?

296
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,102
Yeah.

297
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:20,841
I have to look after her for a while.

298
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:24,109
Is that right?

299
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:27,051
Someone upstream asked me to--

300
00:46:27,154 --> 00:46:29,350
Just for a while.

301
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:32,957
I see.

302
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,222
I've never seen her around.

303
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,388
It's complicated.

304
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,863
She's a relative?

305
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,461
Something like that.

306
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:53,811
Toichi, why did you lie to them?

307
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:56,541
I...

308
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,912
I couldn't say I found
her in the river.

309
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:03,149
I know but...

310
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:05,089
lying isn't the way to go.

311
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:12,364
What will you gain
from taking care of her?

312
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,797
You're right.

313
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:15,835
It's okay now but...

314
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:20,838
the villagers will start
getting suspicious.

315
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,873
Rumors will start.

316
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:07,045
You!

317
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:09,988
I saw you before.

318
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:16,589
You were on the other side of the river.

319
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,558
You live around here?

320
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:23,432
No, I don't live around here.

321
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:24,936
You don't!

322
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:27,566
But...

323
00:48:27,675 --> 00:48:30,372
I know a lot about you.

324
00:48:31,612 --> 00:48:34,206
About me?

325
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:37,046
I've been watching you.

326
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:39,882
I know a lot about you.

327
00:50:06,306 --> 00:50:08,468
Gone? She's gone?

328
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:10,737
I woke up and she was gone.

329
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,410
Oh right.

330
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:15,744
I was worried for nothing.

331
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,182
Toichi, I'll be off early today.
I'll see you soon.

332
00:54:04,978 --> 00:54:07,879
Am I in the right spot?

333
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:11,645
I need to go across to the village.

334
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:15,656
I was told I could cross here.

335
00:54:19,026 --> 00:54:21,893
Can you take me there?

336
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:23,430
Yes, sir.

337
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:27,459
- Please get in.
- Okay.

338
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:32,463
You're the boatman?

339
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:35,804
Yes, sir.
In the center, please.

340
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,845
I thought I'd have to row myself.

341
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:47,318
Is it hard?

342
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:48,354
Sorry?

343
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:51,857
You row the boat every day?

344
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,358
Yes, sir.

345
00:54:57,431 --> 00:55:00,298
It must be tough in this heat.

346
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:03,894
There's nothing else I can do.

347
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:08,532
Rowing boats is all I'm capable of.

348
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,805
- You can make a living?
- Sort of.

349
00:55:11,912 --> 00:55:13,505
You get paid?

350
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:19,712
Yes, sir. I don't charge
the villagers though.

351
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,313
I charge city folk five rin.

352
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,017
Oh, okay.

353
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,521
Pay me when we get there.

354
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:30,726
I see.

355
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:36,595
So do you have...

356
00:55:37,938 --> 00:55:39,702
many passengers?

357
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:44,335
There used to be a lot of passengers.

358
00:55:44,445 --> 00:55:46,379
Not anymore?

359
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,743
No.

360
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:52,843
See the rock over there?
I heard there was

361
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:56,389
another boat there.

362
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,584
Ah, over there?

363
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:03,995
Oh, I could've crossed the bridge!

364
00:56:04,098 --> 00:56:07,932
The bridge hasn't been completed yet.

365
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:11,096
Right. They're still working on it.

366
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:17,940
Once it's done,
it'll make things easier.

367
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,707
I guess the area will get busier.

368
00:56:21,815 --> 00:56:23,544
I guess so, sir.

369
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,025
But then...

370
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:34,652
you'll lose your job.

371
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:37,663
Well I don't know, sir.

372
00:56:37,765 --> 00:56:40,666
If it's there,
I guess folks will use it.

373
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:43,396
It'll be convenient

374
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:44,994
for everyone.

375
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:51,670
What's important is that
folks can commute with no trouble.

376
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,107
So I wouldn't worry about myself.

377
00:56:57,418 --> 00:56:59,113
Right.

378
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,084
As they say, nothing stays the same.

379
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:06,115
Life's hard.

380
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,562
- Here we are.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:15,468
Go ahead.

382
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:18,561
Thank you.
Oh, I have to pay.

383
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:26,739
Thank you, sir.

384
00:57:27,815 --> 00:57:29,010
<i>Thank you!</i>

385
00:57:30,584 --> 00:57:33,781
It was nice.
Will you be here later?

386
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:36,481
Yes, sir, I'll be here.

387
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,582
If you can't find me,
check the hut.

388
00:57:39,693 --> 00:57:41,422
I'll do that!

389
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,867
The river is nice.
I'll see you when I return.

390
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:56,708
Boatman! We need to cross.

391
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:04,449
It's her ass...
She's an ugly bitch but what an ass.

392
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:08,651
Hey, how about you?

393
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,749
You ever got laid?

394
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:13,725
- Me?
- You.

395
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:18,090
You row a stupid boat all day.

396
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:19,826
I guess not!

397
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,492
Of course not!

398
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:24,594
An ugly old man like you
has no chancel!

399
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:28,835
And it costs money to get laid.

400
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:34,614
Girls wouldn't do you.
You're too spooky.

401
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:36,979
I wouldn't if I was a girl.

402
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:40,054
I wouldn't do you if you were a girl!

403
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:44,615
You smell like a corpse.

404
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:47,490
Lay off. It's depressing.

405
00:58:47,594 --> 00:58:49,926
Think about it, boatman.

406
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,759
What we do every day...

407
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:56,496
We put our blood,
sweat and tears into that bridge.

408
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:58,504
Show us gratitude!

409
00:58:58,605 --> 00:59:03,805
The villagers are very grateful, sirs.

410
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:06,846
They can't wait for it to be finished.

411
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:09,279
Of course.

412
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:11,051
How about you?

413
00:59:12,286 --> 00:59:17,087
I'm asking about you.
Not the villagers.

414
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:19,626
Will you be happy when it's made?

415
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:22,752
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

416
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:26,800
Then we'll make it sooner for you.

417
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,134
The villagers will be glad
not to use this dirty boat any more.

418
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:39,973
Useless things disappear.

419
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,809
Understand?

420
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:02,263
Useless things disappear.

421
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:04,895
Useless things disappear.

422
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:07,599
Useless things disappear.

423
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,973
Useless things disappear.

424
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:15,174
Once it's done,
it'll make things easier.

425
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:20,277
Once it's done,
it'll make things easier.

426
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:28,124
But then you'll lose your job.

427
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:31,028
But then you'll lose your job.

428
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:35,328
They say it'll be convenient.

429
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:38,037
They say it'll be convenient.

430
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:40,004
We won't need your boat.

431
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:42,599
We won't need your boat.

432
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,977
You're too spooky.

433
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:50,016
You're too spooky.

434
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:52,347
We'll make it sooner for you.

435
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,815
We'll make it sooner for you.

436
01:00:54,922 --> 01:00:58,017
That bridge will be bad for you!

437
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,992
That bridge will be bad for you!

438
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:03,655
Let's destroy the bridge
before it's done.

439
01:01:03,764 --> 01:01:06,256
Let's destroy the bridge
before it's done.

440
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:08,995
Let's destroy the bridge
before it's done.

441
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:11,731
Let's destroy the bridge
before it's done.

442
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,274
Let's destroy the bridge
before it's done.

443
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,275
Let's destroy the bridge
before it's done.

444
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:12,950
Hello!

445
01:03:16,864 --> 01:03:22,132
You look dazed, boatman.
Are you all right?

446
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:25,171
- Sorry.
- Weren't you listening?

447
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:29,038
You said that the village
was quite pretty.

448
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:32,976
I said that before I got on the boat.

449
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:37,841
Come on, I give up!

450
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:41,114
You really weren't listening.

451
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,416
I'm sorry.

452
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:47,086
You asked me why I went to the village.

453
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:53,296
I told you that I was going
to see my patients.

454
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,570
Do you remember that?

455
01:03:59,874 --> 01:04:01,399
Certainly...

456
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:05,970
Oh boy, you don't look like you do.

457
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:14,010
- So?
- Sir?

458
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:18,285
- Should I continue?
- Please do.

459
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:20,884
I lost my enthusiasm...

460
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:24,397
I'm sorry.
I was preoccupied.

461
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:26,466
You can do the talking.

462
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:28,365
No, really...

463
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:32,165
Where was I?

464
01:04:32,273 --> 01:04:35,140
You know Nihei's father, right?

465
01:04:35,242 --> 01:04:39,839
Yes, Nihei gave me potatoes
the other day.

466
01:04:39,947 --> 01:04:42,109
You told me that already!

467
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:45,242
Nihei's father and I go back.

468
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:49,983
His legs are getting weak
and he has a bad cold.

469
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:52,149
That's not good.

470
01:04:52,259 --> 01:04:55,456
So I went over to see him.

471
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,465
But then there were more patients.

472
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:03,366
I ended up seeing a dozen patients!

473
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,234
I see.

474
01:05:07,107 --> 01:05:10,236
If a town doctor has an easy life

475
01:05:10,344 --> 01:05:12,574
he's no longer a town doctor...

476
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:21,586
Whatever I say,
you only half-listen to.

477
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,591
Here.

478
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,120
That doctor's got a screw loose.

479
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:45,130
He needs this bag!

480
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:49,100
How can he forget something so important?

481
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:52,571
I think he's a great man.

482
01:07:52,673 --> 01:07:57,736
He comes all the way from town
to see his patients.

483
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,244
Right.

484
01:07:59,346 --> 01:08:01,337
It's really something.

485
01:08:02,383 --> 01:08:05,114
You've got a point there.

486
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:07,449
We sure owe him a lot,

487
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:12,221
but it's not good to forget this!

488
01:08:16,163 --> 01:08:20,430
The doctor left in the late afternoon.

489
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:24,732
We only noticed his bag late at night.

490
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:30,107
We would've noticed it sooner,

491
01:08:30,211 --> 01:08:35,240
but he put it by a pot
in the dark doorway.

492
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:39,546
I wonder how he'll work today.

493
01:08:39,653 --> 01:08:41,246
Right?

494
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:44,848
It'd be strange if he saw
patients without this.

495
01:08:56,603 --> 01:09:01,097
That man's going to deliver
a bag to the doctor!

496
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:07,212
The doctor did his rounds
here yesterday.

497
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:10,215
He left his bag at that man's place.

498
01:09:11,585 --> 01:09:15,385
He's a bit of an odd character,

499
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,548
but...

500
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:20,127
I feel like...

501
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:24,125
he sees straight through me.

502
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,336
The doctor said he'd come back.

503
01:09:33,307 --> 01:09:38,211
You should talk to him
if you're still in pain.

504
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,615
Do you have any pain?

505
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:47,321
No.

506
01:09:50,424 --> 01:09:52,449
Okay.

507
01:09:52,559 --> 01:09:53,754
He's a good man.

508
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,890
You should consult him
if you need to.

509
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:07,565
My job is to help people
cross the river.

510
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:12,276
You can see that.

511
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:17,647
Every day, I meet all sorts of people
crossing the river.

512
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:23,383
It makes me happy
to help out folks a little.

513
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,894
Well...

514
01:10:29,863 --> 01:10:34,198
I guess it means nothing to you.

515
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:46,676
I thought you went
back home or something.

516
01:10:52,453 --> 01:10:54,251
You didn't go home?

517
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:00,461
Right.

518
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:03,462
Do you have anywhere to go?

519
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:09,900
Right.

520
01:11:10,004 --> 01:11:13,998
Well, I have little to offer,
but you can stay...

521
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,744
as long as you want.

522
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:24,407
I live alone so you won't be
putting me out.

523
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:33,789
Toichi, how are you doing?

524
01:11:33,894 --> 01:11:35,589
Genzo!

525
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:37,027
Going upstream?

526
01:11:38,065 --> 01:11:41,035
No, not today.

527
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:48,570
She came back?

528
01:11:48,676 --> 01:11:51,737
Yes, last night.

529
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:53,438
Right.

530
01:11:53,547 --> 01:11:57,814
Ah well... I brought some bean paste
that someone gave me.

531
01:11:57,918 --> 01:12:00,012
I'll cook it on a hot rock.

532
01:12:00,321 --> 01:12:02,756
I thought I could give you some.

533
01:12:02,857 --> 01:12:06,350
Oh, I'd love that!
Are you sure?

534
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:09,452
No problem.
It'll last longer cooked.

535
01:12:09,563 --> 01:12:11,793
It goes with eggplants.

536
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:14,334
And also this!

537
01:12:14,435 --> 01:12:17,063
I have some millet to eat.

538
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:20,397
Why don't you eat with us, Genzo?

539
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,601
You don't mind?

540
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:25,577
I never say no to kindness.

541
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,507
I'll take care of the paste!

542
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:44,589
What's that smoke?
You cooking?

543
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:50,467
Yes. Genzo dropped by,
so we'll eat together.

544
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:52,699
Oh, sorry to bother you.

545
01:12:55,075 --> 01:12:57,407
You want to join us, Nihei?

546
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,980
Thanks, but no thank you.

547
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:03,715
I have to go back.

548
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:11,521
My folks are waiting to know
if I returned the bag.

549
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:16,426
Right. How was the doctor?

550
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:20,660
Was he able to work without the bag?

551
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:21,929
Well...

552
01:13:23,604 --> 01:13:26,767
He was like, "Oh, I had no ideal"

553
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:31,102
But his maid told me that

554
01:13:31,412 --> 01:13:34,006
he looked all over for the bag.

555
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:37,415
He even sent his patients away.

556
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:41,614
Right.
It sounds like you saved him.

557
01:13:41,722 --> 01:13:46,091
What would he have done
if I hadn't returned it?

558
01:13:48,429 --> 01:13:50,420
He talked about you.

559
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:58,028
He said, "The boatman is quiet,
but very humane."

560
01:13:58,138 --> 01:13:59,697
What's that mean?

561
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:04,643
Well I have no idea what he means.

562
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:08,579
He offered to help you
if you ever need it.

563
01:14:08,682 --> 01:14:11,777
That's so kind of him.

564
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:16,113
Nihei.

565
01:14:16,223 --> 01:14:20,524
How about the rumor
about the incident upstream?

566
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:22,153
What rumor?

567
01:14:22,463 --> 01:14:25,694
I just overheard it but some folk

568
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,895
were killed in Ichi-nomiya.

569
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:30,697
Pass me the paste.

570
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:33,901
And this.

571
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:38,070
To cook it.

572
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:40,976
Like this.

573
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:49,714
What a nice smell!

574
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:52,053
This is really delicious.

575
01:14:53,794 --> 01:14:57,662
They say cooked bean paste
won't last three months.

576
01:14:57,765 --> 01:15:00,632
You can't stop eating it.

577
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:04,827
You want a go?

578
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:08,133
Try it.

579
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:13,490
On this one.

580
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:13,844
On this one.

581
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,581
Watch out!

582
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:19,779
If you don't,

583
01:15:19,887 --> 01:15:21,719
you'll get burned!

584
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:34,134
I haven't seen her recently.

585
01:15:34,235 --> 01:15:36,761
She's been back for a while.

586
01:15:36,871 --> 01:15:38,600
Right.

587
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,542
How's it going, Genzo?

588
01:15:46,814 --> 01:15:48,111
Hey, Nihei!

589
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,946
- On your way home?
- Yes.

590
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:57,721
I haven't seen your dad around.
How is he?

591
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:03,922
He's in bed with a summer cold.

592
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:06,523
He's getting old.

593
01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:08,659
Is that so?

594
01:16:08,769 --> 01:16:12,967
Watch out. Summer colds can take
a turn for the worse.

595
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:14,768
Sure.

596
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:18,773
Have you eaten?

597
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:23,248
Toichi invited me to join you,
but I can't today.

598
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,842
Are you sure?

599
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:27,182
What's that?

600
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:29,656
Bean paste.

601
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:31,691
Is it grilled?

602
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,123
Sounds good.

603
01:16:33,227 --> 01:16:36,561
I'll bring you some later!

604
01:16:36,664 --> 01:16:39,998
Only if you have leftovers.

605
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:43,662
Don't overcook it.
It'll stick to the rock.

606
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:45,000
Sure thing!

607
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:47,073
Thanks, Toichi.

608
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:52,106
The...

609
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:55,913
Take it off!

610
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:57,093
Get the paste off before
it burns.

611
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,017
Get the paste off before
it burns.

612
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,588
<i>- See you, Genzo!
- See ya!</i>

613
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,887
Watch it! It's burning!

614
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:15,368
Today's meal is really impressive!

615
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:17,728
Thank you, Genzo.

616
01:17:17,838 --> 01:17:22,298
No worries, Toichi.
Most of it's yours.

617
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:30,646
Want this?

618
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:54,834
Is your village...

619
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:57,870
over that way?

620
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:03,942
This way then?

621
01:18:08,723 --> 01:18:11,090
You came from upstream.

622
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:17,820
So I think that's where your home is.

623
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:20,677
Do you remember your village?

624
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:24,763
Do you remember your village?

625
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:37,111
It's okay. As long as you have
some memories.

626
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:43,281
A hit to the head can make you
forget who you are.

627
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:48,956
You remember, right?

628
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:52,699
No.

629
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,360
You forgot?

630
01:19:00,408 --> 01:19:01,842
Yes.

631
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,137
Nothing at all?

632
01:19:08,115 --> 01:19:09,480
Nothing.

633
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:33,171
You know...

634
01:19:35,075 --> 01:19:38,409
You can't remember, right?

635
01:19:40,948 --> 01:19:43,042
Since when?

636
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:48,887
When?

637
01:19:50,224 --> 01:19:53,387
Yes. I mean...

638
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:57,095
What do you remember?

639
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:09,537
What is your name?

640
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:13,845
Do you remember?

641
01:20:17,451 --> 01:20:20,887
My name is Toichi.

642
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:24,018
How about you?

643
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:30,422
You don't remember?

644
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:38,100
Well...

645
01:20:42,109 --> 01:20:43,543
I'm sorry.

646
01:20:46,447 --> 01:20:48,006
I mean...

647
01:20:52,553 --> 01:20:54,351
I'm sorry.

648
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:19,172
No passengers today.

649
01:21:21,015 --> 01:21:23,484
I've never seen that girl!

650
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:27,885
What weird clothes!
She must be a monster.

651
01:21:27,988 --> 01:21:30,389
- Monster!
- Die! Go away!

652
01:21:31,959 --> 01:21:34,121
Sssh! Leave us alone!

653
01:21:35,396 --> 01:21:36,886
Go on!

654
01:21:58,519 --> 01:22:03,548
Do you think you've been
in a boat before?

655
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:07,652
Do you want to try?

656
01:22:09,496 --> 01:22:11,396
The boat?

657
01:22:11,499 --> 01:22:13,058
Yes.

658
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:19,132
Can I?

659
01:22:21,442 --> 01:22:23,035
Okay.

660
01:22:26,047 --> 01:22:29,073
Let's go then.

661
01:22:30,384 --> 01:22:31,647
Yes.

662
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:35,488
There are no passengers so...

663
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:38,625
Let's do it.

664
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:02,180
There's some fish! See?

665
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:07,084
The river is calm here
so the fish come out.

666
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:16,255
Actually...

667
01:23:17,431 --> 01:23:19,126
it's Fu.

668
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:24,695
That's what it is.
It's Fu.

669
01:23:27,207 --> 01:23:31,303
You mean your name?

670
01:25:02,503 --> 01:25:05,768
You mean, she's not that girl?

671
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:09,707
No one's even heard
that story you told me.

672
01:25:11,178 --> 01:25:13,510
Nothing about any murders...

673
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:15,412
I see.

674
01:25:15,516 --> 01:25:18,713
Thank you for visiting Ichi-nomiya for me.

675
01:25:22,756 --> 01:25:24,155
Wind?

676
01:25:25,426 --> 01:25:27,224
Your name...

677
01:25:28,896 --> 01:25:33,493
If your name is Fu,
it might mean wind.

678
01:25:35,402 --> 01:25:36,699
Why?

679
01:25:38,138 --> 01:25:42,439
No reason, but it might be
what your name means.

680
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:45,538
Wind...

681
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:50,716
Yes. It's possible.

682
01:26:03,931 --> 01:26:05,456
How about Toichi?

683
01:26:08,602 --> 01:26:10,263
My name?

684
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:17,874
I don't know...

685
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:20,657
Maybe Toichi doesn't mean anything.

686
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:24,242
Maybe Toichi doesn't mean anything.

687
01:26:25,419 --> 01:26:27,513
It doesn't?

688
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:29,350
I don't know.

689
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:35,157
If Fu is wind,

690
01:26:35,262 --> 01:26:36,923
what is Toichi?

691
01:26:39,233 --> 01:26:42,498
I've never thought about it.

692
01:26:42,603 --> 01:26:43,798
Why not?

693
01:26:48,642 --> 01:26:51,168
You think about my name,

694
01:26:51,278 --> 01:26:53,770
but not yours?

695
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:55,747
That's how it goes.

696
01:26:56,951 --> 01:26:58,715
Really.

697
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:16,200
I thought it'd be interesting
if your name meant wind.

698
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:19,837
You know?

699
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:23,899
The wind can make the river
flow faster.

700
01:27:24,945 --> 01:27:27,937
It even changes the river's character.

701
01:27:30,284 --> 01:27:33,686
If I'm a boatman and you're the wind

702
01:27:33,788 --> 01:27:36,485
I thought it'd be interesting.

703
01:28:35,316 --> 01:28:39,310
Thank you.
Can you stack them there?

704
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,911
Wipe it for me.

705
01:29:45,653 --> 01:29:47,052
Watch your step.

706
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:49,589
Thank you.

707
01:29:53,427 --> 01:29:54,861
Go easy.

708
01:30:03,771 --> 01:30:05,535
You want to come?

709
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:18,584
It's almost finished?

710
01:30:18,686 --> 01:30:21,849
Looks that way, ma'am.

711
01:30:21,956 --> 01:30:24,755
They have more people working on it.

712
01:30:24,858 --> 01:30:27,793
They look busy lately.

713
01:30:28,929 --> 01:30:33,696
I hope we can use it by autumn.

714
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:36,566
I hope so, too.

715
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:42,734
Particularly with a baby,
it'll make things easier.

716
01:31:20,114 --> 01:31:22,640
Boatman, can we cross the river?

717
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:26,550
Certainly.
I'll get the boat ready.

718
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:35,955
- I hope it goes well.
- Yes.

719
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:39,863
- You practiced?
- Yes but it's not easy.

720
01:31:39,967 --> 01:31:42,459
It's difficult.

721
01:31:49,209 --> 01:31:52,201
<i>- I want sugar candy.
- Toffee for me!</i>

722
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:57,041
Forget food!
This is your first festival performance.

723
01:31:57,151 --> 01:32:00,883
I know but candy's better
than flowers.

724
01:32:00,988 --> 01:32:04,219
You talk about food, men and...

725
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:08,086
How about focusing
on your performance?

726
01:32:08,195 --> 01:32:09,959
But it's a festival!

727
01:32:14,001 --> 01:32:16,800
Thank you very much.

728
01:32:16,904 --> 01:32:18,770
Thank you.

729
01:32:47,034 --> 01:32:48,832
You want to try?

730
01:32:50,638 --> 01:32:52,834
Over to the shore?

731
01:33:11,325 --> 01:33:14,590
When I first started I was told

732
01:33:15,796 --> 01:33:20,233
three days to use oars
and three years for the pole.

733
01:33:20,334 --> 01:33:23,668
Poles are that difficult.

734
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:33,573
Keep rowing.

735
01:33:33,681 --> 01:33:35,046
That's good.

736
01:33:57,404 --> 01:33:59,115
When the bridge is complete...

737
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:00,937
When the bridge is complete...

738
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:08,114
how different will it be?

739
01:34:13,387 --> 01:34:17,346
Back when I started rowing boats

740
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:21,185
the river was much cleaner.

741
01:34:21,295 --> 01:34:26,734
I saw lots of fireflies at night.

742
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:29,804
I bet you've seen fireflies?

743
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:32,962
Yes.

744
01:34:33,073 --> 01:34:35,405
According to the villagers,

745
01:34:35,709 --> 01:34:40,943
fireflies only thrive in pristine water.

746
01:34:42,783 --> 01:34:48,745
And boy, those fireflies
were beautiful!

747
01:34:51,225 --> 01:34:54,024
But gradually...

748
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:59,059
there seem to be less fireflies.

749
01:35:02,069 --> 01:35:03,264
Why's that?

750
01:35:05,773 --> 01:35:07,070
Well...

751
01:35:08,108 --> 01:35:09,872
What do you mean?

752
01:35:11,045 --> 01:35:13,207
Is the water dirty now?

753
01:35:18,019 --> 01:35:20,920
Since they started building the bridge...

754
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:25,215
I don't see many fireflies.

755
01:35:30,497 --> 01:35:32,465
Poor fireflies.

756
01:35:34,134 --> 01:35:38,696
Bridges aren't important.

757
01:35:42,977 --> 01:35:45,309
I prefer fireflies to bridges.

758
01:35:47,414 --> 01:35:49,007
Fireflies and...

759
01:35:50,117 --> 01:35:52,313
clean rivers are better.

760
01:35:55,489 --> 01:35:59,323
Me too.
I prefer fireflies.

761
01:36:01,929 --> 01:36:05,126
But when something new comes along...

762
01:36:06,834 --> 01:36:12,136
the old things go.
That's how it is.

763
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:18,741
Like a wind can send
a boat out of control,

764
01:36:18,846 --> 01:36:23,044
a breeze eventually
changes the way of the world.

765
01:36:28,889 --> 01:36:30,323
It'd be better...

766
01:36:31,492 --> 01:36:33,961
if there was no wind.

767
01:37:26,547 --> 01:37:27,946
Go ahead.

768
01:37:37,258 --> 01:37:38,953
It's rocking.

769
01:37:39,059 --> 01:37:41,426
Yes, the wind's strong today.

770
01:37:43,097 --> 01:37:45,498
I felt a drop.

771
01:37:46,867 --> 01:37:49,359
It might get stormy.

772
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:54,101
Right. It's kind of unpredictable.

773
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:23,103
I guess no passengers
will come in this rain.

774
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:35,445
What are you making?

775
01:38:36,483 --> 01:38:39,976
Oh, this thing...

776
01:38:41,455 --> 01:38:43,651
Well, it's a...

777
01:38:50,331 --> 01:38:53,266
I'll show you something nice.

778
01:38:59,406 --> 01:39:01,238
Is it treasure?

779
01:39:01,342 --> 01:39:03,538
Something like that. Here.

780
01:39:23,998 --> 01:39:25,329
Beautiful, isn't it?

781
01:39:26,733 --> 01:39:28,997
Someone gave it to me.

782
01:39:30,137 --> 01:39:31,448
That person is no longer around.

783
01:39:31,472 --> 01:39:34,339
That person is no longer around.

784
01:39:36,077 --> 01:39:39,672
The last time she crossed the river...

785
01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:43,077
she gave it to me.

786
01:39:44,485 --> 01:39:48,615
She said she'd never
come back here so

787
01:39:49,657 --> 01:39:52,092
she wanted me to keep it.

788
01:39:52,193 --> 01:39:54,321
And never show anyone.

789
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:58,997
It's a secret that she shared with me.

790
01:40:00,434 --> 01:40:01,595
Why?

791
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:07,731
Maybe it's that precious.

792
01:40:11,045 --> 01:40:12,376
You know...

793
01:40:14,115 --> 01:40:17,449
Her face is stuck in my mind.

794
01:40:20,454 --> 01:40:23,981
I don't know why
she gave me that picture but...

795
01:40:25,726 --> 01:40:27,626
I can't forget her.

796
01:40:30,497 --> 01:40:32,090
She had...

797
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:38,036
a slight resemblance
to the woman in the picture.

798
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:41,640
How can I put it?

799
01:40:44,311 --> 01:40:46,279
She was sorrowful.

800
01:40:49,517 --> 01:40:51,212
And...

801
01:40:52,686 --> 01:40:54,654
her sorrow...

802
01:40:56,457 --> 01:40:58,789
was unforgettable.

803
01:41:17,578 --> 01:41:19,706
Toichi!

804
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:24,546
It's me, Nihei!

805
01:41:33,494 --> 01:41:35,394
What is it?

806
01:41:35,496 --> 01:41:38,056
Why are you here in this rain?

807
01:41:38,165 --> 01:41:39,564
I need to cross.

808
01:41:41,202 --> 01:41:44,695
It doesn't have to be this minute.

809
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:50,368
But please take me when you're ready.

810
01:41:50,478 --> 01:41:53,504
Certainly. Come inside.

811
01:41:56,117 --> 01:41:57,346
It's okay.

812
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:01,618
Thank you.

813
01:42:02,857 --> 01:42:05,792
Sorry to ask when it's raining like this.

814
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:11,157
Toichi.

815
01:42:14,368 --> 01:42:15,733
It's Dad.

816
01:42:17,405 --> 01:42:18,839
He died.

817
01:42:27,715 --> 01:42:29,114
My Dad...

818
01:42:30,584 --> 01:42:31,813
He's dead.

819
01:42:33,554 --> 01:42:35,648
As you know, Toichi,

820
01:42:35,756 --> 01:42:39,420
Dad hunted for a living.

821
01:42:39,527 --> 01:42:40,637
He always hunted rabbits,
deer, and boars across the river.

822
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:43,858
He always hunted rabbits,
deer, and boars across the river.

823
01:42:44,164 --> 01:42:47,498
He shared the game,
if he did well.

824
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:52,431
One day he told me,

825
01:42:53,907 --> 01:42:59,368
"I've been living this long
thanks lo the lives I took.

826
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:02,677
"All the lives I was given...

827
01:43:02,783 --> 01:43:07,277
"When I die, give my body
to the animals in the hills.

828
01:43:08,388 --> 01:43:12,222
"Without my soul, I'd just be flesh.

829
01:43:13,661 --> 01:43:19,327
"I'd be happy if you fed me
to the animals.

830
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:22,596
I want to return their favor.”

831
01:43:31,312 --> 01:43:36,876
But some folks might find it spooky
to leave a body

832
01:43:36,984 --> 01:43:39,180
<i>to animals to eat.</i>

833
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:42,720
So Toichi.

834
01:43:43,958 --> 01:43:49,294
I want to do it secretly
So no one knows.

835
01:43:51,699 --> 01:43:54,259
In the night hours...

836
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,802
before the daybreak.

837
01:43:57,538 --> 01:44:00,906
I want to fulfill his wish.

838
01:44:07,715 --> 01:44:09,342
I It's a lot to ask...

839
01:44:11,519 --> 01:44:14,853
but please help me.

840
01:50:52,887 --> 01:50:57,347
Sorry I got you involved in this.

841
01:50:59,293 --> 01:51:01,819
You always helped Dad cross.

842
01:51:03,097 --> 01:51:06,643
With your boat you helped him
carry the lives he was given.

843
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:09,261
With your boat you helped him
carry the lives he was given.

844
01:51:10,704 --> 01:51:14,766
Dad would've been so happy...

845
01:51:17,077 --> 01:51:19,307
Thank you, Toichi.

846
01:52:00,388 --> 01:52:01,878
Fireflies.

847
01:52:06,327 --> 01:52:08,295
Fireflies...

848
01:52:08,395 --> 01:52:09,829
They're still there.

849
01:52:10,864 --> 01:52:12,332
Yeah.

850
01:52:17,505 --> 01:52:18,215
Maybe one is Nihei's dad's soul departing.

851
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:23,075
Maybe one is Nihei's dad's soul departing.

852
01:52:26,246 --> 01:52:27,941
I always thought...

853
01:52:29,917 --> 01:52:34,980
Nihei's dad was a great man.

854
01:52:37,491 --> 01:52:42,861
He dedicated his life
to helping others.

855
01:52:45,132 --> 01:52:47,157
How difficult is that.

856
01:52:50,537 --> 01:52:52,198
But me...

857
01:52:53,974 --> 01:52:58,878
I'm helping others.
I like to think I'm doing that but...

858
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:02,872
I feel they owe me.

859
01:53:04,051 --> 01:53:07,351
I hope the bridge never gets made.

860
01:53:07,455 --> 01:53:10,857
I can't help thinking like that.

861
01:53:10,958 --> 01:53:12,824
I'm full of myself.

862
01:53:15,029 --> 01:53:17,259
But for Nihei's dad...

863
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:22,269
others came before him.

864
01:53:22,369 --> 01:53:24,337
Even after he died...

865
01:53:26,006 --> 01:53:28,236
he wants to be of benefit.

866
01:53:33,047 --> 01:53:33,289
That's the kind of man...

867
01:53:33,313 --> 01:53:35,077
That's the kind of man...

868
01:53:36,884 --> 01:53:38,545
I'd like to be.

869
01:54:23,197 --> 01:54:25,188
The troubadours!

870
01:54:25,299 --> 01:54:27,097
How festive!

871
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:29,033
What funny costumes!

872
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:34,406
I can't wait for the festival.

873
01:54:38,379 --> 01:54:40,939
It's going to be fun.

874
01:54:42,216 --> 01:54:43,360
We heard that the bridge
isn't finished yet...

875
01:54:43,384 --> 01:54:44,852
We heard that the bridge
isn't finished yet...

876
01:54:44,952 --> 01:54:48,115
Thank the Lord for the boatman!

877
01:54:48,222 --> 01:54:51,556
Every year I'm in the festival but...

878
01:54:51,659 --> 01:54:52,990
No bridge.

879
01:54:53,093 --> 01:54:56,085
Builders nowadays are quick!

880
01:54:56,196 --> 01:54:58,961
- They sure are.
- I can't wait!

881
01:54:59,066 --> 01:55:04,197
- It's all about convenience.
- We need a bridge.

882
01:55:04,305 --> 01:55:07,536
It'll be great once we can walk across.

883
01:55:07,641 --> 01:55:10,269
Next year we can do that.

884
01:55:10,377 --> 01:55:12,311
Then we won't get wet.

885
01:55:12,413 --> 01:55:14,643
And it will be quicker!

886
01:55:14,948 --> 01:55:16,109
It'll be great.

887
01:55:16,216 --> 01:55:18,150
It'll be much easier.

888
01:55:18,252 --> 01:55:20,152
My kid hates boats.

889
01:55:20,254 --> 01:55:24,248
- We won't need the boat any more.
- It'll be easier.

890
01:55:24,358 --> 01:55:27,658
- We can cart things over.
- It'll be so easy.

891
01:55:27,962 --> 01:55:30,659
- How convenient.
- I can't wait.

892
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:12,240
Look. Is that smoke?

893
01:56:12,339 --> 01:56:14,535
- Where?
- You're right!

894
01:56:16,143 --> 01:56:17,406
Is it the bridge?

895
01:56:18,712 --> 01:56:20,339
Isn't it almost done?

896
01:56:24,118 --> 01:56:25,608
I hope it's okay.

897
01:56:38,766 --> 01:56:43,465
...but I know a lot about you.

898
01:56:43,571 --> 01:56:45,539
About me?

899
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:48,472
I've been watching you.

900
01:56:48,576 --> 01:56:51,341
I'm a ghost and I live here.

901
01:56:51,445 --> 01:56:52,708
That's nonsense.

902
01:56:53,014 --> 01:56:55,346
<i>You don't have to believe me,</i>

903
01:56:55,449 --> 01:56:58,009
but I know a lot about you.

904
01:56:59,186 --> 01:57:01,712
That's why I came lo you.

905
01:57:03,057 --> 01:57:06,721
That girl has the life owed to me.

906
01:57:07,027 --> 01:57:09,394
<i>She was meant to die that night...</i>

907
01:57:10,698 --> 01:57:13,190
and I was lo replace her

908
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:16,668
<i>while her soul waited to reincarnate.</i>

909
01:57:16,770 --> 01:57:18,568
Reincarnate?

910
01:57:18,673 --> 01:57:20,607
What?

911
01:57:20,708 --> 01:57:22,301
But you saved her.

912
01:57:23,377 --> 01:57:26,540
You interfered with our fate.

913
01:57:26,647 --> 01:57:29,582
She'll cause you grief someday.

914
01:57:29,684 --> 01:57:33,746
I know you well.
1 advise you to think well.

915
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:26,925
Toichi. Are they ready?

916
02:00:37,271 --> 02:00:39,831
I don't know...

917
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:42,409
Maybe you can do better?

918
02:00:52,853 --> 02:00:53,752
Oh, well.

919
02:00:55,289 --> 02:00:57,223
I'll come back for them.

920
02:01:42,503 --> 02:01:43,766
It's time.

921
02:01:44,939 --> 02:01:48,773
I'll go see the doctor.

922
02:02:31,919 --> 02:02:36,481
Old Toichi is kind of losing it.

923
02:02:40,394 --> 02:02:43,056
Maybe you're a burden to him now.

924
02:02:48,369 --> 02:02:53,034
Surely you don't want
to stay here forever?

925
02:02:54,742 --> 02:02:58,736
It's time you left.
It'd be good for both of you.

926
02:03:05,753 --> 02:03:10,020
I never told you,
but I went to your village.

927
02:03:10,124 --> 02:03:11,922
Toichi asked me to.

928
02:03:13,494 --> 02:03:17,124
Was it Ichi-nomiya?

929
02:03:20,634 --> 02:03:23,535
What I heard didn't really add up.

930
02:03:27,708 --> 02:03:29,699
You know what I'm saying?

931
02:03:34,048 --> 02:03:35,413
Let go.

932
02:03:40,855 --> 02:03:43,085
I can take care of you.

933
02:04:03,077 --> 02:04:06,980
You look pale.
I bet you're not eating well.

934
02:04:08,516 --> 02:04:09,779
Well...

935
02:04:14,155 --> 02:04:15,554
Toichi.

936
02:04:18,459 --> 02:04:20,655
You need to take it easy.

937
02:04:22,763 --> 02:04:25,733
It's bad to think too much.

938
02:04:28,602 --> 02:04:30,969
You'd lose your mind if you did.

939
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:37,170
Life is short.
Might as well enjoy it.

940
02:04:37,478 --> 02:04:38,673
Right?

941
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,784
You know why we reincarnate?

942
02:04:53,494 --> 02:04:56,088
We need to live many lives...

943
02:04:58,633 --> 02:05:01,125
to grow wiser.

944
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:07,770
We're brought to this world to learn

945
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:11,505
one thing before we depart.

946
02:05:11,612 --> 02:05:15,981
What you learn varies
from one person to another.

947
02:05:18,519 --> 02:05:21,113
You live to find that thing.

948
02:05:24,892 --> 02:05:28,795
And you cross a river
to move on to the next life.

949
02:05:31,699 --> 02:05:34,930
I know!
Since you're a boatman...

950
02:05:36,070 --> 02:05:39,802
you'll have no problem
crossing the Styx.

951
02:06:42,603 --> 02:06:43,866
Toichi.

952
02:06:48,609 --> 02:06:52,273
Toichi, I haven't seen you
for a long time.

953
02:06:54,915 --> 02:06:56,280
You went to town?

954
02:06:56,383 --> 02:06:59,353
Yes, I visited the doctor.

955
02:06:59,653 --> 02:07:01,178
Right.

956
02:07:04,959 --> 02:07:06,654
Sorry, Toichi.

957
02:07:09,096 --> 02:07:12,896
After this was built,
I hardly visit you.

958
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,798
It's okay...

959
02:07:16,971 --> 02:07:19,906
All the villagers...

960
02:07:20,007 --> 02:07:24,672
Since we got the bridge
everyone acts so busy.

961
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:30,315
Many villagers went to live in town.

962
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:36,014
What will happen to us?

963
02:07:43,364 --> 02:07:47,096
I miss the times you took us across.

964
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:52,298
Back when we weren't in a hurry
like we are now.

965
02:07:59,446 --> 02:08:00,880
Toichi...

966
02:08:03,918 --> 02:08:07,946
can you take me
out on your boat someday?

967
02:08:11,259 --> 02:08:12,818
Certainly.

968
02:08:51,064 --> 02:08:52,691
What happened?

969
02:08:55,002 --> 02:08:56,436
What is it?

970
02:09:15,122 --> 02:09:16,453
What happened?

971
02:09:22,296 --> 02:09:23,730
Tell me what happened!

972
02:09:34,375 --> 02:09:37,140
It won't get worse.

973
02:09:40,548 --> 02:09:43,745
It won't get worse than this.

974
02:09:45,253 --> 02:09:47,119
Calm down.

975
02:09:47,221 --> 02:09:51,180
I won't blame you for anything!

976
02:09:51,291 --> 02:09:53,919
You've done nothing wrong!

977
02:09:54,028 --> 02:09:58,022
<i>You just protected yourself!</i>

978
02:09:58,132 --> 02:10:00,897
You're not to blame!

979
02:10:03,237 --> 02:10:08,437
I'm not so righteous as to blame you!

980
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:14,004
I'm just a selfish nobody!

981
02:10:14,115 --> 02:10:15,879
But I...

982
02:10:15,983 --> 02:10:17,883
thought...

983
02:10:21,822 --> 02:10:24,257
I could protect you.

984
02:10:29,163 --> 02:10:31,154
I wanted to...

985
02:11:38,899 --> 02:11:43,427
I've got nothing left here anyway.
