00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,304
Riley!

1
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:14,602
Riley!

2
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,328
Riley!

3
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:23,948
Riley!

4
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:25,238
Riley!

5
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:34,228
Where are you, Riley?

6
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:39,965
Riley, answer me!

7
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,809
Riley!

8
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,950
Riley!

9
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:50,184
Where are you, honey? Riley!

10
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,540
Riley!

11
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:31,731
Another return,
and yet another big name.

12
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:36,149
Jamie Dugger ruled the roost
around here for a while.

13
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Oh thank God.

14
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:46,922
Riley.

15
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:00,900
Honey, are you okay?

16
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,459
You're freezing.

17
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,014
Let me take him up to
the shower and warm him up.

18
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,015
Come on.

19
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:20,959
Put your clothes over there in the corner,

20
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,060
and try not to get water everywhere, okay?

21
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:44,597
It's the thing
that keeps him up at night.

22
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:49,149
And if he doesn't win this, I mean it...

23
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,709
They don't know what happened to him.

24
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,959
They think he might have had a seizure,

25
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,433
but the MRI and the EEGs
all come back normal.

26
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,523
So that's it?

27
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,659
They don't wanna check and see

28
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,449
if maybe there's something else wrong?

29
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,499
Yeah, they wanted to keep
him overnight for observation

30
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,899
and to run more tests, and I said no.

31
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,279
Why? We don't know what happened to him.

32
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,359
Joyce, we were there for 12 hours.

33
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,329
They couldn't find anything.

34
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,009
He was on the street.

35
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,113
You don't think that's a little strange?

36
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,669
This is why we let them work.

37
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,483
What if this happens to him again?

38
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,549
Next time, God forbid, he
could disappear for good,

39
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,079
or we could find him dead.

40
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,689
No, no, no.

41
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,939
Honey, if it were anything that bad,

42
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,590
they wouldn't have let him leave.

43
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,943
We gotta let him rest.

44
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,759
I'll call Dr. Bartlett in the morning,

45
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,669
and she can check him out.

46
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,570
I don't know how you can
trust her and not the hospital.

47
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,219
She's a free thinker. That's good.

48
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,429
Someone to dig deeper and ask questions,

49
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,809
not just stop in the first period.

50
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,879
Do what you want, Arther.

51
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,373
But I don't trust her over the hospital.

52
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,960
Hey, buddy, how you doing in there?

53
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,060
Riley, you're wasting
water just standing there.

54
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:53,692
What?

55
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,703
Nothing. Just hurry up, okay?

56
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,709
No no no, not tonight, no.

57
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,019
If you really did have a seizure,

58
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,409
we don't need anything that
might start another one.

59
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,569
You just need to get your rest, all right.

60
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,799
We'll call the doctors in the morning,

61
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,203
and they'll make sure
everything's fine, okay?

62
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:27,787
Ugh.

63
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,899
Let's take a
look at this week's weather.

64
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,279
The rest of the afternoon is clear.

65
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,079
For the most part, staying in the 50s,

66
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,249
but we do have a system
moving in overnight

67
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,469
that will lead to some rain.

68
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,129
So temps will be dropping
to the mid-30s overnight,

69
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,669
which could lead to some black ice.

70
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,869
Watch out on the roads tomorrow.

71
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,699
We move back into the 60s, nice warmup,

72
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,719
and we stay there for rest of the week.

73
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,640
Plenty of sun...

74
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:31,289
Since
the beginning of mankind,

75
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,913
humans have disappeared without a trace.

76
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,849
Could it be that extraterrestrial
activity is to blame?

77
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,629
Some ancient astronaut theorists say yes.

78
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,039
Since the beginning of recorded history,

79
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,169
human beings have disappeared
without any explanation.

80
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,469
The most famous case, Amelia Earnhardt.

81
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,393
Gone without a trace.

82
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,499
And there isn't one universally
accepted explanation

83
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,849
as to what happened to her.

84
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,529
But, there is one theory
that almost everyone

85
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,281
refuses to acknowledge,
ancient astronauts.

86
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,419
Dude, sucks
you couldn't play today.

87
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,249
Sucks that someone stole my crutches.

88
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,209
Really, dude? That does suck.

89
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,059
Oh, so what was up with that hip check?

90
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,369
Oh, dude, the kid was
arrogant. He deserved it.

91
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,993
Hey, I'm not sympathizing.

92
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,079
Oh, did you ask that kid,
Brad, about those tickets?

93
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,649
The dude left before I could ask him.

94
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,359
He's acting weird today.

95
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,193
I don't know, man.

96
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:18,215
I just don't want the
tickets to go to waste.

97
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:20,699
Okay, I'll call him.

98
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,063
Who calls anyone anymore?

99
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,665
Yeah?

100
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,709
Hey, man, I
tried to get your attention

101
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,306
outside the rink today,
but you ignored me.

102
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:47,645
Oh, sorry about that. I
just have a lot of my mind.

103
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:49,279
What's up?

104
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,393
It's my brother. Something's
not right with him.

105
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:55,528
Why, what's wrong with him?

106
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:58,299
Well, we found him on the side

107
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,889
of the road yesterday, knocked out.

108
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,563
Oh, shit. Is he okay?

109
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,639
Yeah, but I don't know.

110
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,423
It's all just really weird.

111
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:13,073
Hey, I know it's
kinda a awkward question

112
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:14,879
but me and Eric have an
extra set of the tickets

113
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,299
to the Blizzards game.

114
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,163
We were wondering if you wanna go.

115
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:21,489
Hell yeah. But, I don't know.

116
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,943
My family's just really worried right now.

117
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,060
All right, just let me know.

118
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,860
I got two of them. I need to
get rid of them by tonight.

119
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:32,353
All right, I'll text you later.

120
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:34,685
Awesome, dude, thanks.

121
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:37,983
Oh, and by the way, who calls anymore?

122
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,849
And?

123
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,733
Well, he said he'll let me know tonight.

124
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,080
You know, calls are free after nine.

125
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,101
Let's go, Limpy.

126
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:22,899
Hey there, Bradley.

127
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Hi.

128
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,689
Hey, sweetie, how was practice?

129
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,890
It was good.

130
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,663
Hey, before you sit
down, go wash your hands.

131
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,663
Hey, how is Riley?

132
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,209
He's better.

133
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,563
He's upstairs, practicing for the parade.

134
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,439
He see a doctor?

135
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,379
No, apparently she has too
many patients to deal with.

136
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,699
You can cut her some slack, you know.

137
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,984
She has to prioritize.

138
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,613
Bradley, it's ready.

139
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,283
Hey, Dad?

140
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,229
Jesse said that he could
get me some tickets

141
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,669
to the Blizzards game tomorrow.

142
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,309
Can we go?

143
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,703
Nah, I don't think so.
We got a lot going on.

144
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,889
But, Dad, this is the game that decides

145
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,129
who goes to the playoffs.

146
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,632
Honey, we don't know what's
going on with your brother.

147
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,218
I really think it's
best that you don't go.

148
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:36,636
But I wanna go.

149
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,289
Hey there,
buddy, how you doing?

150
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,123
Better.

151
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,239
Are you sure?

152
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,639
Yeah.

153
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,329
So, what's that I heard about a game?

154
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,499
Oh, Jesse said that he can give us

155
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,200
some tickets to the game tomorrow.

156
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,429
I wanna go.

157
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,519
Riley, I don't think it's a good idea.

158
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,863
Come on, it was just one
freak accident or something.

159
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Please, Mom?

160
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,189
Fine, you can go.

161
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,040
Yes!

162
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,629
But I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

163
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,669
Anything happens between now
and then, and you're not going.

164
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,919
I'll have
to text Jesse tonight

165
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,439
and tell him that we can go.

166
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,679
Really, Arther?

167
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,129
- What?
- Really?

168
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,963
What?

169
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:29,921
He can go? He can go to the game?

170
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:31,209
He's gonna go to a hockey
game with his brother.

171
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,339
What's the matter with that?

172
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,919
There's gonna be 100 people there.

173
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,118
Nothing will happen to him.

174
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:36,412
And you have a crystal ball?

175
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,968
People there, and that means
nothing's gonna happen to him?

176
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,973
Riley! What the hell
is the matter with you?

177
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,930
What?

178
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,860
What'd you do that for?

179
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:21,861
Do what?

180
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,883
Dad, what did I do?

181
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,752
Dad, what did I do?

182
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,050
You...

183
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,050
Just eat.

184
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,070
Just eat.

185
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,729
We can get him these new hockey skates

186
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,289
that match the stick.

187
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,719
Actually, he needs a new stick too,

188
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,349
because that one's kinda warped.

189
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,419
You saw that, right?

190
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,489
Yes, of course I saw that.

191
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,443
Then what was that?

192
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,639
I don't know, Joyce.

193
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,953
I don't know what is going on, Joyce!

194
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,709
I don't think you
guys should go tomorrow.

195
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,969
What am I supposed to tell him?

196
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,679
We can't go see the game because I thought

197
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,513
I saw you throw your food on the floor?

198
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,469
There's something going on.

199
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,749
The three of us saw him do
something that he didn't do.

200
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,499
How can we all be mistaken?

201
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,456
I can't deal with this right now.

202
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:55,110
Where's Brad?

203
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,766
He went to get a drink.
Didn't you see him?

204
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:58,892
No.

205
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:19,296
Brad?

206
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:25,471
Brad?

207
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,433
Where did everybody go?

208
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,343
Where's Brad?

209
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,850
Stop looking at me like that.

210
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,723
What's going on?

211
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,085
You need to go back.

212
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,239
What's wrong with you?

213
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,689
Why would you do that, huh?

214
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,953
The playoffs, and I'm missing it.

215
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,076
And not to mention you embarrassed me

216
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:20,627
in front of my whole damn team.

217
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,989
You stupid idiot.

218
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,940
I knew I shoulda just left you at home.

219
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,803
Seriously, Riley, why?

220
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
I don't know.

221
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:37,069
I can't handle it.

222
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,070
Handle what?

223
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,949
The noise.

224
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,223
What noise?

225
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,570
And the pain.

226
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,640
It's like a knife in the back of my neck.

227
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:50,755
I just want it to go away.

228
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,483
Where were you?

229
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:58,289
You weren't even there, and
you don't even give a shit.

230
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,223
I went to get a drink.

231
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,259
And it's not like I left you alone.

232
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,089
I left you with what, Eric and Jesse?

233
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,543
There was no one there. It was empty.

234
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:13,735
I don't even think the person
that I saw was actually Jesse.

235
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,403
I'm sorry I called you an idiot.

236
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,929
But, I still do think
that there's definitely

237
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,573
something wrong with you.

238
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:40,323
I didn't mean it like that.

239
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,323
Shit, we lost.

240
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Hey, honey.

241
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,769
You okay?

242
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,179
Yeah.

243
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,439
Are you sure?

244
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,493
Do I look unsure?

245
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,583
I guess not.

246
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:23,229
Is there anything to eat.

247
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,253
I'm going out for groceries right now.

248
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,999
Do you wanna talk about
what happened last night?

249
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Not really.

250
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Okay.

251
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,730
I'll be back.

252
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,010
Do you want anything from the store?

253
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,129
Waffles.

254
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,130
Okay.

255
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,569
What did you forget?

256
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,413
Nothing, I got everything.

257
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,519
Wait, how'd you get here so fast?

258
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,519
Riley, I've been gone
for almost two hours.

259
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,086
What? That's impossible.

260
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,959
Honey, are you okay?

261
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,013
Yeah, I probably just fell asleep.

262
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,319
Mom?

263
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah?

264
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,869
Can I ask you a question?

265
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,870
Go ahead.

266
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,519
Do you ever get these
dreams that feel so real?

267
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
What do you mean?

268
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:19,089
Like the dreams I
have, they feel so real.

269
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,189
Like, physically real.

270
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,673
And when I wake up I can't move.

271
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,700
It's like something's holding me down.

272
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,233
I used to, when I was younger.

273
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,179
My parents brought me to a shrink,

274
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,173
and they determined it was just
because I was stressed out.

275
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,259
Which is probably happening to you

276
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,253
because of the parade coming up.

277
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,330
Maybe.

278
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,413
But you're not gonna bring
me to a shrink, right?

279
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Go rest.

280
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,849
Honey, I know your hiphop
group has been practicing

281
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,469
for the Halloween parade tonight, but

282
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,253
I really don't think you should go.

283
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,049
But, Mom, it's the parade.

284
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,201
I can't miss the parade. It's
my favorite thing all year.

285
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:20,969
Plus, my hiphop team would
be really mad if I don't go.

286
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,109
Sweetie, they will understand.

287
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,609
I've already talked to your teachers.

288
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,489
I told them you weren't feeling well.

289
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,259
They said that it's not a
problem, and they look forward

290
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,560
to seeing you back when
you're feeling better.

291
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,139
Mom, I'm going to the parade.

292
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,489
And I also want you to stop acting

293
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,893
like I'm sick when I'm not.

294
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,399
Okay, we will go, but on one condition.

295
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,409
If you start feeling at all strange,

296
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,883
we are leaving right away.

297
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,640
Deal.

298
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,893
We're in the street.

299
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,451
Here.

300
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,543
Riley?

301
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:24,247
Riley?

302
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,690
Riley, stop, you're going to choke.

303
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,317
What is the matter with you?

304
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Excuse me.

305
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,210
Excuse me.

306
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,513
Excuse me, excuse me.

307
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:03,234
My name is Samantha, and I'm
just a psychic up the street.

308
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,225
And I know you don't know me and I know

309
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:06,049
this sounds so weird.

310
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,059
I noticed your son back
there in the parade.

311
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,483
He's in distress, and
I think I can help him.

312
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:16,376
Thank you, but we have to go home now.

313
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:20,153
You know, here. You know what,
just take my business card.

314
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,443
Here, take this, and call me.

315
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Thank you.

316
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,630
Call me.

317
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:54,051
What are you doing?

318
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,050
It itches.

319
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,230
I can't get at it, and it's
starting to really burn.

320
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,200
You're going to make it
worse. Just stop scratching.

321
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,263
All right, time to pass them up.

322
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,879
Now remember, these are
gonna be given back to you.

323
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,239
So any correct answers you have,

324
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,940
you can use them on a cheat sheet.

325
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,663
Hey. Hey, Riley.

326
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,813
Hey, fart knocker, give me your paper.

327
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Never mind.

328
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,579
Mr. Polo, what was the name

329
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,059
of that book you said to pick up?

330
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,610
Thanks, Kerry. Thanks, Kerry.

331
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:42,749
"Burnt Toast and Oranges,"
I need every one of you

332
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,809
to pick up this book at the library.

333
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,659
I ordered enough copies so
everyone could have one.

334
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,169
I went to get it already,
and she doesn't have it yet.

335
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,199
Well, they probably
don't have it in yet.

336
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,602
You have until Christmas
vacation to read the book

337
00:34:54,603 --> 00:34:57,199
and to turn me in your analysis.

338
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,787
Thanks, Kerry.

339
00:34:58,788 --> 00:34:59,734
Yeah, Kerry.

340
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,733
Yeah, Kerry.

341
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:23,912
Riley, turn in your paper.

342
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,183
Riley, are you okay?

343
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:40,647
Yeah, I think so.

344
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,150
Stop it.

345
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,610
Stop it.

346
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,489
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

347
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,363
Stop it, stop it.

348
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,865
Stop it, stop it.

349
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:36,699
Riley.

350
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:37,650
Stop it, stop it!

351
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,483
You okay?

352
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:41,914
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!

353
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:46,473
Stop it, stop it, stop
it, stop it, stop it!

354
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:11,983
Hello, Riley.

355
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,970
I heard you didn't have a good night.

356
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,133
Maybe I'm understating that.

357
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,990
Can you tell me what happened?

358
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,619
Honey, please, just tell
her what's been going on.

359
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,739
She's only trying to help.

360
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,139
Maybe he can't talk because of all

361
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,259
the screaming he's been doing.

362
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,429
He hasn't said anything all morning.

363
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,109
How bad was it?

364
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,295
Pretty bad. I couldn't get him to stop.

365
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,143
Was it just screaming, or was it verbal?

366
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,929
Yeah, he kept on saying "Stop it"

367
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,453
and kept on covering his ears.

368
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,570
Can you open your mouth for me?

369
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,609
Well, I don't think that's the reason

370
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,993
he hasn't said anything.

371
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,859
Oh, and when I tried to calm down,

372
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,459
he pushed me with his legs
and I flew across the room.

373
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,019
Bradley, please.

374
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,479
Dad, why would I lie
about something like that?

375
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,649
Listen to yourself.

376
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,909
How could he physically do that to you?

377
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,779
There are times when humans express

378
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,319
a great deal of strength
under fight or flight,

379
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,759
a state of mind when an individual

380
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,109
is in a life-threatening situation.

381
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,379
If what you're saying's true,

382
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,063
he may have been in that state.

383
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,303
But the question now is why.

384
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,879
Thank you for coming out.

385
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,339
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to conclude what's going on.

386
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,779
Yeah, well, I hope somebody
finds out something soon.

387
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,259
You know, this wasn't his first episode.

388
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,010
It's the worst one he's had so far.

389
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,379
Mr. McDowell, I shouldn't
be telling you this,

390
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,473
but Riley's not alone.

391
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,659
What do you mean?

392
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,143
He's not the first
patient I've seen this way.

393
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,789
Just the other day, I
received a call from a woman

394
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,609
whose husband was acting
the exact same way.

395
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,571
And there was another
patient, about a week ago.

396
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:46,759
Well how are they doing?

397
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,349
Well, as far as I
know, he's not improving,

398
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,409
and the other committed suicide.

399
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,539
Look, I'm not telling
you this to alarm you.

400
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,619
There are other doctors facing the exact

401
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,263
same issues with their patients.

402
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
What do you mean?

403
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,439
I'm gonna go back to my
office, and I'm going to do

404
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,190
the very best I can to figure
out what's going on here.

405
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,313
It's happening here as
well. How do we proceed?

406
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:43,469
Okay.

407
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:41,343
Riley, what are you doing
out here? It's freezing.

408
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,349
I'm fine.

409
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,400
Yeah, well, you haven't been acting it.

410
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,623
What's been wrong with you?
You're worrying everyone.

411
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,913
I said I'm fine.

412
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,640
Dude, that's a load of bullshit.

413
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,219
One minute, you're perfectly fine.

414
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,829
The next minute, you're freaking out.

415
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,899
Happened at dinner, happened at the game,

416
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,150
even happened last night.

417
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,893
I'm scared, Bradley.

418
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:19,523
I know, me too.

419
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,963
But, you don't see me
freaking out about it.

420
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,589
I don't know what I'm doing.

421
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,029
You guys keep saying I'm doing something,

422
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,929
and I'm not doing anything
at all, I'm serious.

423
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,063
I just hear this noise.

424
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,849
Hurts to know my family
doesn't even believe me.

425
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:43,689
Bro, that's not it at all.

426
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,749
Honestly, even though you
don't remember doing all this,

427
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,069
you're still doing it, we see it.

428
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,870
Then what happened in the kitchen?

429
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,345
I don't even know what's real anymore.

430
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
Uh-huh.

431
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,090
Okay.

432
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,198
No.

433
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,817
Look, man, I was just asking him

434
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:25,287
to help me with something really quick.

435
00:43:25,288 --> 00:43:26,323
Shut up.

436
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:28,739
I heard you interrogating him.

437
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,532
I don't know what interest you have

438
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:33,783
in the relationship I have with my son.

439
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,409
Riley, stop it.

440
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,973
I can't. It's itching.

441
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:44,013
It's almost like I'm
not even getting at it.

442
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Stop it.

443
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,519
Honey, you're bleeding.

444
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,673
How long have you been scratching?

445
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:55,919
I don't know, a while.

446
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,909
Go wash it and put a Band-Aid on it

447
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,303
before it gets infected.

448
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,879
Okay.

449
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,929
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

450
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,249
I'll discuss it with my wife
and we'll get back to you.

451
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,250
Okay, bye.

452
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,173
So what's going on?

453
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,079
They wanna bring him in for psychiatric

454
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,273
evaluations for a few weeks.

455
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,430
Oh God.

456
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,793
You don't think that...

457
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,916
No no, no no, don't look at it that way.

458
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:37,023
What's going on with him,
it's hard to explain.

459
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,029
You didn't tell them
about yesterday, did you?

460
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,030
No.

461
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:23,812
Time to go, sweetie.

462
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,709
Mr. McDowell?

463
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,543
Dr. Silver.

464
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:04,549
Hello.

465
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,157
Please, have a seat.

466
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,729
Sorry to have to meet in here.

467
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,119
I was expecting your
wife to join us as well,

468
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,829
and my office can get a little cramped.

469
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,419
She's helping our oldest son get ready

470
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,899
for a hockey tournament
in Camden tomorrow.

471
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,393
Oh, boy, that's a hike.

472
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,593
Okay.

473
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:28,393
Riley McDowell, age 13.

474
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,039
So during his time here,
we ran several tests,

475
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,539
both mental and physical,

476
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,149
and we kept him under
24-hour surveillance.

477
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,823
However, in those two weeks,
he did not have any outbursts.

478
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,269
None, none whatsoever?

479
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,609
No, no.

480
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:48,193
From what our staff reports,
they've had no issue with him.

481
00:46:50,348 --> 00:46:52,289
But what we have noticed is that

482
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,218
he becomes catatonic at times.

483
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,373
What's that mean?

484
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,260
Well, at times, he becomes
reserved and unresponsive.

485
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,949
Now, with that and his sudden
changes in personality,

486
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,869
his auditory hallucinations,
the outbursts,

487
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,909
there are many answers
that can be given here.

488
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,799
Such as spectrum disorder
or schizophrenia.

489
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,119
Now, I don't believe that
he's developed autism.

490
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,083
However, schizophrenia is possible.

491
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,929
As of right now, we just
don't have enough evidence

492
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,609
to come to any kind of
definitive conclusion.

493
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,639
I'm sorry, how can that possibly be?

494
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,466
We just haven't been able
to collect enough evidence.

495
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:37,469
Two weeks, two weeks
you've had my son here

496
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,329
under 24-hour surveillance,

497
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:40,842
with the best medical team in the country,

498
00:47:40,843 --> 00:47:42,539
not the country, in the world,

499
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,319
and you tell me you can't figure this out?

500
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,839
Mr. McDowell, there's a lot that...

501
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,299
I'm sorry, I saw him throw
that plate on the floor,

502
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,139
the whole family did,
for no apparent reason.

503
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,059
And there's a whole arena full of people

504
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,119
that saw him have his meltdown.

505
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,869
And that poor kid nearly
blew out his lungs

506
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,309
screaming in fear, twice.

507
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,359
And you have the nerve
to sit there and tell me

508
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,279
you don't think there's
anything wrong with him?

509
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,280
Fuck you!

510
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,799
Well, Mr. McDowell,
there's only one thing

511
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,350
that I can recommend right now.

512
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,529
Take Riley home today.

513
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,119
Let him continue as he normally would.

514
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,489
He's allowed to go to school,

515
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,249
and to perform his everyday activities.

516
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,859
But if he has another episode, record it.

517
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,719
I'd recommend on video and on paper.

518
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,453
And make sure that what
he's doing is noted.

519
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,909
Then bring me that information for review.

520
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,539
Because, at this time,
we just can't trigger

521
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,483
his behavior in this environment.

522
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,340
I'm sorry.

523
00:48:48,312 --> 00:48:50,727
I'll prepare the discharge paperwork.

524
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,300
Riley?

525
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:41,119
Hey.

526
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,989
Yeah?

527
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:43,990
You okay?

528
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:47,113
I'm tired.

529
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,583
I've got a headache.

530
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,499
You don't look like you slept very well.

531
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,289
You're probably happy to
be back in your own bed.

532
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,290
We're almost home.

533
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,373
Wait, Dad, what was
I just doing right now?

534
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:15,416
What?

535
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,287
Did I fall asleep?

536
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:44,281
Tony wants to be whipped

537
00:50:44,282 --> 00:50:46,562
like a government mule.

538
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:48,313
Watch the power drop.

539
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:52,849
Lift your feet up.

540
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,399
Dammit, I let him get me!

541
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,400
Jesse!

542
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
Sorry.

543
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,178
You're gonna have to keep
it down when your brother

544
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:08,512
gets home, he needs to rest.

545
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:24,349
Was that an
offensive move or a seizure?

546
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,299
Why are you sending him
to school so early anyways?

547
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,049
He's missed two weeks, Bradley.

548
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,000
Any more, he could go to summer school.

549
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:38,657
Do you have everything
you need for tomorrow?

550
00:51:38,658 --> 00:51:39,976
Yeah.

551
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:42,489
Are you sure?
That's a four-hour drive.

552
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:43,853
Mom, we'll be fine.

553
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:48,369
Tony wants to be whipped

554
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,851
like a government mule.

555
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:52,694
Oh hi.

556
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:56,542
Oh, I am so glad you are home.

557
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,369
Hey, what do you say we get
you into bed and you can

558
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,479
eat ice cream and watch
movies on your phone

559
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,497
for the rest of the night, huh?

560
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:05,498
Come on.

561
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,530
You guys pumped for tomorrow?

562
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:15,409
- Yeah.
- Sure.

563
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,959
Do me a favor, put
that on pause, will you?

564
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,169
I wanna talk to you.

565
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,949
Dad, we can't. It's online.

566
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,283
Brad, please.

567
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,316
Hold my biscuit.

568
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:29,166
I'm sorry, man, I just
can't do that. You know that.

569
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,250
Just do it.

570
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:39,579
Hey, I know we've been focusing a lot

571
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,569
of attention on your brother right now.

572
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,049
But I want to apologize.

573
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,259
I'm not gonna be able to make
it to your big game tomorrow.

574
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,009
I missed a lot of work, and I
gotta make it up. Understand?

575
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,066
It's fine.

576
00:52:49,067 --> 00:52:50,466
No, it's not fine.

577
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,623
It's just that we gotta keep
on our toes right now with him.

578
00:52:54,735 --> 00:52:57,969
Didn't we send him away two
weeks so he could get better?

579
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,892
Yeah, they were supposed
to try to figure it out.

580
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:02,499
It wasn't therapy or anything.

581
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,839
Hey, listen, I'm gonna be rooting for you,

582
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,669
even though I'm not there.

583
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,933
It's not that.

584
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:11,313
I want everything to be over with him.

585
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,023
It will be soon. We're getting close.

586
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,024
Yeah.

587
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:14,127
Bradley?

588
00:54:29,403 --> 00:54:31,091
Mom? Dad?

589
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:05,264
Mom, Dad, Bradley?

590
00:55:21,464 --> 00:55:22,714
Mom, Dad, Brad?

591
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:33,317
No.

592
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:19,776
Please, I don't wanna do this anymore.

593
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:24,032
I'm tired of this.

594
00:56:24,033 --> 00:56:25,963
Please, just leave me alone.

595
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,056
I can't do this, no.

596
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:40,692
Can you just let me go home if I do this?

597
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:41,022
Shit.

598
00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:59,510
They have a limit here.

599
00:58:59,511 --> 00:59:02,639
Only 400 people are allowed per day now.

600
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,519
The reason is because thousands
upon thousands of people

601
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,639
in modern day come outta their busy lives

602
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,699
just to walk the paths that people walked

603
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,973
hundreds of years ago.

604
00:59:15,776 --> 00:59:18,149
Wyatt, could you come in
here a little quieter?

605
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,339
It's already bad enough coming
in late, being a distraction.

606
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,365
Now where was I?

607
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:23,176
Sorry, Mr. Polo.

608
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:24,643
Sorry, Riley.

609
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,179
Still in the 15th century...

610
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,129
One of the Seven
Wonders of the World.

611
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,629
Why, you ask? Well, look at it.

612
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,479
It's 8,000 feet above sea level.

613
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,049
Now we here, we're just 141.

614
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,629
Now look at that.

615
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,819
Straight down, that's a 2,000-foot drop.

616
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,769
Now the one thing we
do know about the Incas

617
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,653
is they were a little
behind on technology,

618
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:52,269
meaning they didn't use wheels

619
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,589
and they didn't use
animals to haul things.

620
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,299
So, with that lack of
machinery and the obvious

621
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,879
steep incline and challenges,
the biggest question

622
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,919
has always been, how did they build it?

623
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,009
How did they get those huge
stones all the way up there

624
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,339
to Wina Picchu where
the high priest lived.

625
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,379
And the second thing, of course,

626
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:13,059
is we know nothing about
why it was abandoned.

627
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,426
In 1572...

628
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:16,139
It was aliens.

629
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,339
Jason, please, don't
shout out like that.

630
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,209
Well, I mean, just look at Egypt.

631
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,829
Oh my God, shut up. You sound retarded.

632
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,609
Katelyn, stop it.

633
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:27,879
Jason, realistically,
with as little as we know,

634
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,469
anything is possible.

635
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,959
Okay, but the most likely
scenario is that when

636
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,099
the Spaniards invaded,
they brought diseases

637
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,549
such as smallpox and...

638
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,229
Well if we have no proof
and are going off of theories,

639
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:41,399
my theory is that aliens abducted them.

640
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,629
Okay, well then, we'll just
call the crazy-haired guy

641
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:47,198
from the Geography Channel if
that's what we're doing now.

642
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:48,100
Listen, where was I?

643
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:51,909
Oh, yes, 1572, the last
recorded year of the Incas.

644
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,909
Now, as I said, disease may
have wiped them out, okay.

645
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,019
But the Spaniards never even got there.

646
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,989
They just got to the surrounding areas.

647
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,639
They couldn't get there
because of the steep inclines

648
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,989
and because of all the other challenges.

649
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,999
The Incas were, however,
leading in medicine.

650
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,219
We talked about diseases.

651
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,242
They did possibly have
access to medicine that...

652
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:12,729
That just proves my point.

653
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,563
Jason.

654
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:15,759
I mean, if they were
so good with medicine

655
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,199
and the Spaniards never even reached them,

656
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,699
they must have been abducted.

657
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,659
Will you chill with the conspiracies?

658
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,789
Every week, it's the same
thing with your dumb ass.

659
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,169
Hey, Katelyn, how about you go back

660
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,749
to the sheep farm with everyone else?

661
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,689
Hey, listen,

662
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,636
we are about facts here.

663
01:01:31,637 --> 01:01:35,169
And the facts do not support aliens.

664
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:37,469
And, Jason, if you keep
shouting out in my class,

665
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,546
I am gonna send you to the office.

666
01:01:38,547 --> 01:01:40,059
I just don't see how you can teach

667
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,569
an unproven theory
without accepting others.

668
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,170
Okay, that's it, just get out!

669
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,114
Could you just shut up?

670
01:01:48,115 --> 01:01:50,266
Riley, what are you doing?

671
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:11,689
Mom?

672
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,029
What are we doing here?

673
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,323
Don't worry, Riley.
This lady can help us.

674
01:02:35,175 --> 01:02:36,175
Hello?

675
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:39,577
Hello?

676
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:51,829
Hello, anybody here?

677
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:52,830
Hello?

678
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:59,409
Riley, don't touch that,
that could be breakable.

679
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:00,380
Put it back.

680
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:02,419
Good afternoon, can I help you?

681
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,709
Hi.

682
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,439
Um, do you remember me from the parade?

683
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,273
Um.

684
01:03:09,274 --> 01:03:12,159
I'm Joyce, and this is my son Riley.

685
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,160
Yeah, I remember you.

686
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,229
Say hello, Riley.

687
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,063
Hello.

688
01:03:17,064 --> 01:03:18,160
Hi, Riley.

689
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,413
We were wondering if you
had time to do a, uh...

690
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,563
Oh, yes. Come on this way, of course.

691
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,563
Please, have a seat.

692
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,899
So, Joyce, tell me what's
going on with Riley

693
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,943
and what I can do to help.

694
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,729
Well, it all started one morning

695
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,913
when he didn't come down for breakfast.

696
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,166
We called, and after a few
minutes when he still didn't

697
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:15,639
come down, his dad went up to check.

698
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,133
And then I heard him yelling
that he wasn't in his bed.

699
01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:22,229
We thought he was in the house,

700
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,733
so we looked everywhere, but.

701
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,863
When we still couldn't find
him, we headed outside.

702
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:31,763
I was in a panic.

703
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,793
I had no idea where he was.

704
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:41,399
A neighbor found him

705
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,973
in front of their house.

706
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,223
He was in a ditch.

707
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,103
Half unconscious.

708
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,929
Can I get you anything?

709
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,643
Do you need a water or anything?

710
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,913
Okay, well continue. What happens next?

711
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:05,909
We took him to the ER, but they couldn't

712
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:10,169
figure anything out,
so we brought him home.

713
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:15,170
And after that, things really
started getting strange.

714
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:21,379
He kept having these
bouts of covering his ears

715
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,773
and screaming really loudly.

716
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,093
Weird things were happening.

717
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,993
He threw a plate, and he broke it.

718
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:38,259
We all saw him do it.

719
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:43,003
But then, the plate was back
on the table in one piece.

720
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,463
At night, he kicked his brother,

721
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,099
and his brother said the kick was so hard

722
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,813
that he flew across the room.

723
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,279
We called the doctor, she
came to check him out,

724
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,879
and she said the same thing was happening

725
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,859
to some of her other patients,

726
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,679
and she recommended that
he go to the hospital

727
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,949
for two weeks for testing,

728
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,779
which we eventually decided to do.

729
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,623
But since he's been back,
it's been no better.

730
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,099
He just threw a textbook at his teacher,

731
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,263
and he says he never did.

732
01:06:22,788 --> 01:06:24,553
And now he's suspended.

733
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,679
Riley, do you remember anything

734
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,530
about what your mom is talking about?

735
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,640
Mm-mm.

736
01:06:38,479 --> 01:06:40,389
Do you remember why you were covering

737
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:41,590
your ears at the parade?

738
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:48,890
It's this stupid noise, so high-pitched.

739
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,253
It hurts my brain.

740
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:54,759
It comes on and off, but I can never tell

741
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,910
when it's gonna happen.

742
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:07,349
Well, I think the best thing for Riley

743
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:08,983
would be hypnotic regression.

744
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:10,910
It's safe.

745
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:15,029
It would help him to
remember what happened,

746
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:18,369
and maybe we can figure out
why he was in the ditch.

747
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:21,370
It will help him remember what
happened before that as well.

748
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,023
Riley, do you think you're
okay with hypnosis today?

749
01:07:31,573 --> 01:07:32,990
Um, I guess so.

750
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,160
Joyce?

751
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,863
Please, whatever will help
us understand what's going on.

752
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,029
Okay, all right.

753
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:47,463
Come this way, okay? Follow me.

754
01:07:48,907 --> 01:07:50,074
Come this way.

755
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,463
One minute.

756
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:15,483
Dr. Bartlett?

757
01:08:15,483 --> 01:08:16,316
I said one minute.

758
01:08:16,317 --> 01:08:18,339
I've got very sensitive
information I'm looking at.

759
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,209
Yes, sorry, Doctor.

760
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,119
There's a gentleman out here who's like

761
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,259
very insistent on seeing you.

762
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,130
Who is it?

763
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:28,259
Said his name is Arther McDowell.

764
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,093
Okay, send him in.

765
01:08:29,094 --> 01:08:31,549
Don't bother. What's
going on with Riley, huh?

766
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,869
Excuse me, sir, you
can't just come in here

767
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:33,929
and bother Dr. Bartlett.

768
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,349
I'll do whatever I damn well please.

769
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:36,183
He's my son, and I want answers.

770
01:08:36,184 --> 01:08:37,389
It's okay, it's okay.

771
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:38,809
What's going on with Riley?

772
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:39,949
You're gonna have to
give me a little bit more

773
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,979
information than that, Arther.

774
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:44,830
He was suspended from school
for attacking the teacher.

775
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,262
I'm sorry to hear that.

776
01:08:47,263 --> 01:08:49,999
You said that by sending
him away for observation

777
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,159
you'd be able to figure this out.

778
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,019
Well, it's been a waste of time.

779
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,119
We need more time.

780
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,849
Not every medical situation
has an apparent solution,

781
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,069
and they're never the same.

782
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:03,029
I agree. We should have kept him.

783
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:05,579
And if he's becoming violent,
than we need to readmit him

784
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,089
and keep him for as long as it takes

785
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:08,683
to figure out what's going on.

786
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,559
Sarah, you've helped us for many years,

787
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,619
and you know I trust you.

788
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,279
But I don't wanna lock Riley away

789
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,873
if I don't know for how long.

790
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,989
I'm sorry I came in here the way I did.

791
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,313
I just need answers.

792
01:09:34,048 --> 01:09:35,048
Arther,

793
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:39,630
I haven't been completely honest with you.

794
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:41,678
What?

795
01:09:52,632 --> 01:09:53,632
What's going on?

796
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,306
I have a few questions
I'm gonna ask you,

797
01:09:58,307 --> 01:09:59,807
and I need you to answer them.

798
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:02,474
And when I snap my fingers,

799
01:10:02,475 --> 01:10:04,886
that means it's time to wake up.

800
01:10:04,887 --> 01:10:05,913
Are you ready?

801
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,963
Okay, take a deep breath.

802
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,073
And 10,

803
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,120
nine,

804
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,970
eight,

805
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:18,253
seven,

806
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:20,853
six,

807
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,983
five,

808
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,775
four,

809
01:10:25,776 --> 01:10:27,493
three,

810
01:10:28,612 --> 01:10:30,809
two,

811
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,933
and one.

812
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,269
Okay, Riley, I wanna
bring you back to when

813
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,479
your neighbors found
you lying in the ditch.

814
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,530
Do you remember that?

815
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,549
Good.

816
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:49,149
Now I wanna take you back further.

817
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:51,939
I wanna take you back to that night

818
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,539
when you were getting ready for bed

819
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,063
and you were falling asleep.

820
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,109
Tell me what you remember.

821
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:00,760
Tell me what you remember seeing.

822
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,301
Mm.

823
01:11:05,759 --> 01:11:07,969
Noise,

824
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:08,970
it woke me up.

825
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:15,613
It's like, I can't move.

826
01:11:17,934 --> 01:11:20,463
My eyes are open, but I can't move.

827
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:23,910
I'm scared.

828
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:27,899
I'm trying to call for Brad and my dad

829
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,053
and my mom, but no noise
is coming out of my mouth.

830
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,919
You're doing fine, Riley.
You're doing just fine.

831
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,263
What happens next?

832
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:42,510
Bright lights.

833
01:11:44,658 --> 01:11:46,319
I see a light.

834
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,903
Someone's in the room with me.

835
01:11:56,572 --> 01:11:57,572
I'm so cold.

836
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:01,853
Why is my bed so cold and hard?

837
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:08,744
Something is holding my head, why?

838
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:11,439
Why is he holding my head?

839
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,211
No, no, no no no no.

840
01:12:14,212 --> 01:12:15,212
No, no.

841
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,573
It's okay, Riley, just
breathe. You're safe.

842
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:21,880
What do you see around you?

843
01:12:23,202 --> 01:12:24,202
Nothing.

844
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,737
Just bright lights and blackness.

845
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:34,733
She's not letting me turn my head.

846
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:38,809
Please, no, stop.

847
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,279
Stop, please.

848
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,938
Stop, stop!

849
01:12:55,117 --> 01:12:58,030
Bring him out of it, please!

850
01:12:58,031 --> 01:13:01,133
Riley, Riley, we're
gonna bring you back now.

851
01:13:01,134 --> 01:13:03,427
Bring you back into the room. You're safe.

852
01:13:03,428 --> 01:13:04,761
One, two, three.

853
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:09,027
It's okay, Riley.

854
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,543
You too. It happened to
you when you were a child.

855
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,189
Riley.

856
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,026
Come on, honey, we're leaving.

857
01:13:30,027 --> 01:13:30,860
Come on.

858
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:31,693
Honey, come on.

859
01:13:31,694 --> 01:13:34,509
Look. Look, you don't get it.

860
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,409
You and Riley are in
grave danger right now.

861
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,193
They know what just happened.

862
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:43,239
And I don't suggest you
being alone with him.

863
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,023
It's not safe.

864
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:50,370
Wait.

865
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:02,436
I'm sorry, Arther. I really am.

866
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:06,439
But there's no way out of it.

867
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,743
I'm trapped just as much as Riley.

868
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:12,199
They know what's happening to him,

869
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,043
and they are very well aware of it.

870
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,833
But once they fix it, he's gone.

871
01:14:20,447 --> 01:14:22,243
And when they find out I told you,

872
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,910
I'm so sorry, there's nothing we can do.

873
01:16:48,315 --> 01:16:52,659
Arther? Arther, where are you?

874
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,239
I've been trying to call
you for the last half-hour.

875
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,799
Please, I just need you
to come home right away.

876
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,369
It's an emergency.

877
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:04,173
I figured out what's going on
with Riley, but I'm scared.

878
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,779
And I need you.

879
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,609
I don't know what we
should do next, please.

880
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,959
Riley, needs you. I need you.

881
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,669
Just, please come home.

882
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:17,137
Come home, Arther. I'm scared.

883
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,703
Riley, you're bleeding.

884
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:44,620
What are you doing with that?

885
01:17:46,469 --> 01:17:47,469
Riley.

886
01:17:48,735 --> 01:17:50,138
Riley, answer me.

887
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:07,494
Joyce? Riley, Joyce!

888
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:12,375
Oh my God, oh my God, what have you done?

889
01:18:12,376 --> 01:18:16,449
Joyce, Joyce! Riley, why did you do this?

890
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,867
Joyce, oh my God.

891
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,723
I'm sorry, Dad.

892
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:00,590
Riley?

893
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,230
What's wrong?

894
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,153
Where's Mom and Dad?

895
01:19:14,464 --> 01:19:15,642
Inside.

896
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,281
Mom?

897
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,060
Dad?

898
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,183
Holy shit, Dad!

899
01:19:58,724 --> 01:19:59,724
Mom?

900
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,773
I had to do it, Bradley.

901
01:20:15,163 --> 01:20:17,283
I couldn't let them hear the noise.

902
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,269
What noise?

903
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,372
There is no noise!

904
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:30,394
You can't hear that?

905
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,146
It's everywhere and anywhere I go,

906
01:20:34,147 --> 01:20:36,083
and it pierces through my head.

907
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:42,609
You don't know how lucky you are, Bradley.

908
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,343
I would do anything to be you.

909
01:20:57,089 --> 01:20:58,778
You fucking psycho!

910
01:22:00,751 --> 01:22:01,751
Help me!

911
01:22:03,081 --> 01:22:04,414
Help me, please!

912
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:09,229
What's going on?

913
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,230
Let me go!

914
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,067
Who's there?

915
01:22:43,282 --> 01:22:44,576
What's going on?

916
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:51,510
What are you doing?

917
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:58,749
Let go of me, you bitch!

918
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:44,090
What did you, what did you do to me?

919
01:24:07,855 --> 01:24:09,162
I'm sorry.

920
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:25,657
No.

921
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,823
Please, I just wanna go home.

922
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,874
I know.

923
01:25:37,394 --> 01:25:39,699
Transfer's complete.

924
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,700
Should we reset?

925
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:44,751
Yes, send him back.

926
01:26:42,843 --> 01:26:43,843
Riley!

927
01:26:45,211 --> 01:26:46,211
Riley?

928
01:26:50,176 --> 01:26:51,176
Riley!

929
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:54,812
- Riley!
- Riley!

930
01:27:00,587 --> 01:27:03,120
Honey, where are you? Riley?

931
01:27:03,121 --> 01:27:04,121
Oh God.

932
01:27:05,078 --> 01:27:06,495
Riley!

933
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:10,326
Riley, answer me!

934
01:27:10,327 --> 01:27:11,327
Riley!

935
01:27:14,998 --> 01:27:16,415
Riley!

936
01:27:21,788 --> 01:27:22,788
Riley!

937
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:25,979
Guys, over here.

938
01:27:35,477 --> 01:27:37,477
Oh God, oh God, Riley.

939
01:27:38,681 --> 01:27:41,299
Oh my God, honey.

940
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,337
