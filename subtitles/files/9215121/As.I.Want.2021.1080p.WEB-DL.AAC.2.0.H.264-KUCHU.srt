1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
START

2
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,520
When they say it's a boy,

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,039
I feel strong,

4
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,920
and backed up.

5
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
When they say it's a girl,

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,239
the walls fall down on me.

7
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,359
I can hear you singing.

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,519
You always sang that song.

9
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,040
You always used to say that

10
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,560
giving birth to a girl

11
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,079
means lifelong worries.

12
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,159
Why is giving birth to a girl
a lifelong worry?

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,959
Why should I be afraid of my body,
and cover it up?

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,239
Be afraid of my voice, and lower it,

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,680
and be afraid of my laughter,
and suppress it?

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
Why should I be afraid of love?

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,479
Because love is forbidden.

18
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,840
You used to say,

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,960
''You can hang your diploma
on the kitchen wall.''

20
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,199
The best place for a woman
is her husband's home.

21
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,879
A girl is trapped inside this circle.

22
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,680
She is being sexually assaulted.

23
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,360
Right now,

24
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,520
four hands are inside her pants.

25
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,240
Four more inside her blouse.

26
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,560
Ten men are pulling her
in all directions.

27
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,719
One of them is now taking
her shoes off,

28
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,919
so that his friend
can strip her from her pants.

29
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,439
One is grabbing her,
saying he's protecting her.

30
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,879
In fact, he's one of them;

31
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,240
his hand is now inside her underwear.

32
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,919
One is taking his pants off
to give to her.

33
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,800
Another his jacket,
a third is covering her.

34
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,479
But tens are trying to prevent them
with knives.

35
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,199
She can't breathe
from the shoving and pulling.

36
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,840
She is fainting.

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,439
But Thank God,

38
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,800
she has no scarf,
like the girl who nearly got choked,

39
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,000
or the one who got a knife inside her,

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,039
and the others who were kidnapped.

41
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,960
but who managed to escape.

42
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,720
Or like the mother assaulted
before her kids.

43
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Those girls were publicly gang-raped.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,519
First of all,
I'm a friend of Yasmine,

45
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,160
who was sexually assaulted.

46
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,040
Are you the owner of this red shirt?

47
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,720
Yes.

48
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,079
I'm using a fake name,

49
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,439
because, to society I am a disgrace.

50
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,279
I won't go into details
about what happened

51
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
because it happened to many girls,

52
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,160
and is still happening every day.

53
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,720
This reality is the result

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,879
of a sickness in our society,

55
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,959
which has stayed silent
for many years.

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Women are not even allowed
to exercise their rights.

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,480
I feel ashamed of being Egyptian.

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,240
I feel disgusted and oppressed.

59
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,600
What's happening to women
is a crime,

60
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,800
a heinous crime.

61
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,079
It is happening to girls
as young as 14 years old.

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,160
Raped in the middle of Tahrir Square,

63
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,600
and society
still puts the blame on them.

64
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,519
Since there is no law,
no police to protect us,

65
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
and no society to take our side
and protect our rights,

66
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,879
I and many other women
have decided

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,040
to defend ourselves,
in any way we deem fit,

68
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,480
against sexual harassment.

69
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,120
That's my best friend talking, Mamma.

70
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
I think if I had been in her place,

71
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,519
I would never have told you.

72
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,480
Because, you would have blamed me,

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,360
and said, ''Why did you go there?''

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,319
You were there at the beginning,

75
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,120
but assaults gradually increased,

76
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
and got harsher.

77
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,839
Each story I hear
is uglier than the other.

78
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,120
when I arrived...

79
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,040
Well, in most cases
when you reach the girl,

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,360
struggling your way,

81
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,319
she'd already been assaulted.

82
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,040
But you try to get her out
before it gets even worse.

83
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,680
When I arrived,

84
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,920
it was over

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
They had raped the girls.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,439
In the attack that I saw,

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,079
they didn't take girls
from a group.

88
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,439
A group of thugs

89
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,720
attacked the tents
in Omar Makram garden

90
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
in the middle of the sit-in.

91
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,160
People were attacked
during the sit-in.

92
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,839
The thugs started grabbing girls
and sexually assaulting them.

93
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,759
I had one thing in my mind:
I wasn't going to leave

94
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
without those girls.

95
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,319
I suddenly heard calling,
''Anyone needs an ambulance?''

96
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,480
It was impossible
to get the girls out.

97
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,120
There were several of them.

98
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
Were they stripped off?

99
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,839
The one that was with me,

100
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,959
she was stripped off,
but a boy gave her a jacket.

101
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,680
Her pants were not torn off.

102
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,920
they slit open her pants

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,360
and managed
to rip her panties off.

104
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,399
Her bra was ripped off.

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,000
It was in shreds.

106
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,720
Her top was shredded.

107
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,399
It was hanging off her body.

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,560
The ambulance arrived,
and we managed to move the girls out.

109
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,120
I was helping the guy out.

110
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,720
I said, ''I am with them
I am in charge of them.''

111
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,160
There was this man yelling,
''Get out of the way!''

112
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,079
He acted like he wanted to help,
but I could feel his hand on me.

113
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,720
I said,
''Are you assaulting me or what?''

114
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,319
''Are you trying to help me
or assault me?''

115
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,319
I started to scream at them,
that I didn't want any help,

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,759
or anyone coming near.

117
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,439
We finally got into the ambulance.
I thought we were safe.

118
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,120
But no...

119
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,879
What happened next
was another battle...

120
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,319
Getting out of the ambulance...

121
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,480
Everyone jumped onto the ambulance.

122
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,919
The only hope was to go to hospital.

123
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,679
Because it is a secure place.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,679
Anyone hanging onto the ambulance
would run away.

125
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,440
They couldn't follow us
into the hospital.

126
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,919
It was good and bad.

127
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,200
Good because we escaped the crowd,
hanging onto the ambulance.

128
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
Bad, because we had to deal with
security forces and military police.

129
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,799
The girl said ''I want to go to the bathroom''

130
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,200
''I want to be sure I'm still a virgin''

131
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,320
''Sara, I need to go to the bathroom.''

132
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,960
I said, ''OK, calm down.
We will go now.''

133
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,080
She said,
''They put their hands inside me.''

134
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,759
''Their fingers went inside me.''

135
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,759
I said, ''Calm down''.

136
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,279
''You don't have to tell me
what happened now.

137
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,600
''Calm down first,

138
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,320
''then we can talk.''

139
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,559
Then she said,
''Thank God, my sister was out.

140
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,679
''Just before the attack,
she went to get food.

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
''Thank God...

142
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,000
''I want to call her
and tell her not to go back.''

143
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,519
I lent her my phone
so she could call.

144
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,000
She said, ''I'm fine,
nothing happened to me.''

145
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,919
Her sister said,''What's wrong?
I heard what happened!''

146
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
She said, ''I'm fine,
nothing happened,

147
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,799
''Nothing happened to me, I'm fine.

148
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,159
''Just don't tell Mamma.
Don't say anything.''

149
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,399
So...
there was someone from the Security,

150
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,159
some informant I guess.

151
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,679
And also military police officers.

152
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,200
They said they wanted to talk to us.

153
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,039
They asked if something
had happened to us.

154
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,039
They suspected
something had happened to us.

155
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,840
Not just to the girl.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,120
She stayed quiet.
I was the one talking.

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,039
I said nothing happened.

158
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,000
He said,
''You don't want the test?''

159
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,799
I said,
''No, I don't, what for?''

160
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,799
- What test?

161
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,320
Virginity test

162
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,960
I said, ''No, nothing happened.''

163
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,840
So the police put you
into a room at the hospital because...

164
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,919
I think they knew what was happening.

165
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,240
That's why I think it was organized.

166
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,240
They understood what was going on.

167
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,840
When we finally left,
I told her in the car,

168
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm not telling you
to write your testimony or anything

169
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
But when you feel ready to write it,

170
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,159
the way you want,
or to talk about it,

171
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,799
I'll help you.

172
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,399
And then,
I was so glad, because on the 25th of January

173
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,039
I was in the Shobra protest,
she was at Mostafa Mahmoud

174
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,480
She saw Hazem

175
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,440
and told him, ''Tell Sara
I went back to the streets again.''

176
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,200
I was so happy...

177
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,879
Because when I went out on the street,

178
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,440
that's what I wanted to see.

179
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,720
They need to know
they won't break us.

180
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,200
We will keep coming back.

181
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,919
And we did.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,120
We know this a form of repression.

183
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
But they will fail,
because we're not a disgrace.

184
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,200
Maybe we haven't accomplished
the goals of the Revolution yet,

185
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,279
but, a big part of it
was to show people

186
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,039
how important our role is.

187
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,360
That we are not afraid.

188
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,480
And that the Revolution
without women is...

189
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,360
I don't want to say nothing but...

190
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,320
It can't continue without us.

191
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,559
The biggest proof is when
they tried to destroy the Revolution,

192
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,039
they targeted women.

193
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,039
That's it...I have nothing to add.

194
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,440
My God, you are strong, Sara.
You made me cry.

195
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,919
The image is powerful.

196
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,799
It's proof.

197
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,080
It's difficult to erase
from ones memory.

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
That's why
I used my camera as a weapon.

199
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,799
To protect myself...

200
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,480
and face myself at the same time.

201
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,799
Want to grab that beautiful ass.

202
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,919
What do you want to grab?

203
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,240
-What do you want to grab?
-The bag.

204
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,919
-Why?
-Be quiet she's filming.

205
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
-You're filming?
-Yes.

206
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,440
Sure I'm filming.

207
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,639
So when I am harassed in the street,
I'll have proof.

208
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
If I want to sue,
I have evidence.

209
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,639
Understand?

210
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,519
Can I feel your tits?

211
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,240
God give me patience!

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,799
If you go out dressed like that,

213
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,039
I'm sorry, but
anything could happend to you

214
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
You must be careful.

215
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,759
You need to protect your self.

216
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,200
Because no one else will.

217
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,960
Nowadays, boys watch satellite TV,

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,159
they watch porn on the internet.

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,759
They're already aroused.

220
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,559
Don't arouse them even more.
That's all I'm trying to say.

221
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,440
The woman is like a diamond.
Her place is in the home.

222
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,840
Is that wrong, or what?

223
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,320
I wonder what your life
would be like without women.

224
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,440
If God had wanted to create man
without woman, he could have.

225
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,200
God created the woman
from Adam's rib.

226
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,600
-From the rib of a man.
-How's that?

227
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,600
-How was she created?
-You were born from a woman.

228
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,440
Your mother,
who bore you, gave birth to you.

229
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,120
Woman came out of Adam's rib.

230
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,399
Why don't they still come out
of his rib?

231
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,039
That's God's will.

232
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,919
That was the beginning of creation.

233
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,960
Boys don't bring disgrace, girls do.

234
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,519
A girl can bring to her family...
You know.

235
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,039
-Disgrace.
-Isn't it so?

236
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,399
If I had a 100 boys,

237
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,799
they wouldn't worry me
as much as one girl.

238
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,799
What's your name?

239
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,679
My name is Samaher.

240
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,080
-Samaher?
-Yes. Stand still.

241
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,720
Then I can stand still.

242
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,720
You think you're right,
you're not doing anything wrong?

243
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,879
What am I doing wrong?

244
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,480
When you walk like that,
showing your legs.

245
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,919
Surely some guys
will say somethings...

246
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,480
There are men who wear shorts.
Why is it permitted for them?

247
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,120
They are men, we are women.

248
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,600
A woman's body is shameful.

249
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,000
A woman's voice is shameful.

250
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,639
A woman's voice is shameful.

251
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,120
-Did you learn that at school?
-Yes, we learn it at school.

252
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,879
-Why is your face covered?
-Because of my husband.

253
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,120
Your husband?

254
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,320
This is our environment.

255
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,440
I mean no offense, but you're
from a different environment.

256
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,360
You live in Heliopolis.
I live in the countryside.

257
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,240
By the way,
I wore the headscarf for eight years.

258
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,639
But then you tried to change.

259
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,639
Because faith is in the heart.

260
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,320
You were able to change.

261
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,559
Here, if a woman is loud in public
her husband divorces her.

262
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,360
If your wife didn't wear a headscarf,
what would you do?

263
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,120
What we would do in the countryside,
divorce her.

264
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,759
After a man divorces her,
the woman is homeless.

265
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,200
They say you are going to hell.

266
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,960
-Me?
-Yes.

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,360
-Why am I going to hell?
-Because you have revealing clothes.

268
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,840
What do you mean?

269
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,279
Your dress is short.
And your hair shows.

270
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,519
-And what do you think?
-I think everyone is free.

271
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,919
You are beautiful.

272
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,920
I feel I want to go back in time
-there.

273
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,440
How strange.

274
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,160
When I exit the picture,

275
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,880
and look at it from the outside,

276
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,200
I can see you
in every part of the house.

277
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,200
In every corner.

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,599
I sense you around me.

279
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,359
You were 16
when you got married.

280
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,880
Like your daughter,

281
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,720
and your grand daughter.

282
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,599
It was my big sister
Manal's wedding.

283
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,720
I replayed the tape over and over,

284
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
looking at you.

285
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,200
Your face is beautiful.

286
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,480
You look so young.

287
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,200
I was 13 years old.

288
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,880
It was the first time in my life
that you didn't braid my hair.

289
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,359
You told me to let my hair
down on my back.

290
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,680
You said,

291
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,839
''It will soon be your turn
to get married.''

292
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,440
I thank my memory
for not failing me yet.

293
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,480
It is the only way,

294
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
to save the picture.

295
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,880
Silence your phones, guys.

296
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,599
OK...
auntie, start from here.

297
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,200
This is your mark, auntie.
And you stop here.

298
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,000
What's the matter?
What are you doing?

299
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,240
Let's start again.
When I say ''Action''.

300
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,880
How many times do we have to do this?

301
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,319
What's wrong? You're still here?

302
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,640
Still sitting here?

303
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,160
The groom and his family
are waiting for you.

304
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,759
This is shameful.

305
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,599
We'll make you do all the housework.

306
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,079
No friends, no school, nothing.

307
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,839
I never stopped to think of
the childhood I was in.

308
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,799
It wasn't a dream.

309
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
Everything was real.

310
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,920
From her soft nails

311
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,960
With marriage she is crowned

312
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,559
They said,
''The Constitution is our Koran.''

313
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,759
As if our Constitution
is something wonderful.

314
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,599
The Imam El Banna,

315
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,839
peace be upon him,

316
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:40,640
said,
''The Koran that is our Constitution.''

317
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,920
-The Koran is our Constitution!
-It was and it will be!

318
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,880
The Koran
will always be our Constitution!

319
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,119
The Koran is our Constitution!

320
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,359
And the Prophet is our leader!

321
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,319
The Prophet is our leader!

322
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,640
And Jihad is our path!

323
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,519
Jihad is our path!

324
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,359
Egypt will only see
rebirth and revival

325
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,599
through Islamic Sharia law.

326
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,799
Where are you from?
Step back a little.

327
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,599
Where are you from?

328
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,400
From Egypt.

329
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,160
-From Egypt?
-Yes.

330
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
-What's your name?
-Zein.

331
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,319
Where do you live?

332
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,839
In downtown.

333
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,359
Are you originally from Egypt,
or from another country?

334
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,359
Another country but...

335
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,640
Where is Mamma from?

336
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,079
-France?
-Mamma, where am I from?

337
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,680
You're from...

338
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,160
You're from Downtown...

339
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,759
to Downtown...

340
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,400
I am from Palestine.

341
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,720
-You're from Palestine.
-Yes.

342
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,720
Next to the Downtown.

343
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,720
It's not next to the Downtown.

344
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,119
Come inside, Mamma!

345
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,440
Why are you crying?

346
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,960
Why are you crying?
Those are crazy people.

347
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,400
-Crazy people.
-But why are they doing that?

348
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,839
Because they're crazy.
They are fighting each other.

349
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,759
-Please don't cry.
-Now it will be fixed again.

350
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,759
-What my dear?
-The coffeeshop.

351
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,079
Why are you crying? Please don't cry.

352
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,160
Because I don't know what's happening.

353
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,119
Don't cry my love.

354
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,960
I don't know anything.

355
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,440
Just relax inside.

356
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,559
Unbelievable...my son is terrified.

357
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:33,200
Don't be scared, they're crazy.

358
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,559
I'm scared.

359
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,799
They're just nuts,
they don't know what they're doing.

360
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,319
They are crazy.

361
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,640
Why...Because the bad guy here...

362
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,839
Because they're fighting like that.

363
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,119
We don't like that.

364
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,519
I want the iPad.

365
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,119
Let me read you a story instead.

366
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,279
SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAPPENS HERE
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LIGHTS.

367
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,680
Janet, why did you choose
Sadat metro station?

368
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,079
On January 25th, 2013...

369
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,680
A girl got trapped
in front of that gate,

370
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,960
the gate you see there.

371
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,240
She was raped here
because there was no light.

372
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,720
Here it is, Samaher.

373
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,279
You had done a big poster.

374
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,279
Exactly.

375
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,599
-I remember.
-Remember that girl?

376
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,400
Of course.

377
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,880
Did you see the video
with the red circle?

378
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,400
Yes, Aïda's film.

379
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,599
This is the girl
who was in the red circle.

380
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,880
Her hymen was lacerated.

381
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,160
The doctor said she had wounds,
ulcers and boils,

382
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,319
because she didn't see
a doctor right away.

383
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,160
She went about a week later.

384
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,559
Because she had persistent fever.

385
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,680
Caused by the dirty fingers and nails
that went inside her.

386
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,440
Like dirty dogs that snatched her.

387
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,680
Her hands still shake
as a result of the trauma.

388
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,160
A little pat makes her jump away.

389
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,799
Even when she knows
it's you patting on her shoulder.

390
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,359
She can't bear anyone touching her.

391
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,599
Neither a man nor a woman.

392
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,200
We must consider a woman
as a human being

393
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,839
in order to respect her.

394
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,759
As long as she's seen as merely meat,

395
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
veiled or not,
she's only meat.

396
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,160
If a woman is looked at as an object,
then she can be treated like this...

397
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,759
Or like this.

398
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,119
She's just an object,
with no feelings.

399
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,000
Society also looks at her
as an object.

400
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,599
From her father's house,
to her husband's, to the grave.

401
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,400
That's how we see women here.

402
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,759
The campaign we are working on,
where women must take part,

403
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,119
is to boycott elections.

404
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,880
They are always praising women
when they line up to vote.

405
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,079
And stand in line
and add their voice,

406
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,240
and take part
in the political process.

407
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Since I have an active political role
as a woman,

408
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,279
as confirmed by statistics,

409
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,759
sixty percent of voters are women,

410
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
why can't I be elected?

411
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,039
Why are you asking for my vote
if I can't sit in Parliament?

412
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,880
You need my vote
to sit in Parliament,

413
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,759
while it won't get me there.

414
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,400
If I can't be a candidate,

415
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,119
you don't deserve my vote.

416
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,039
If I have no right to be elected,

417
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,039
you have no right to ask for my vote.

418
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,839
The problem is much larger
than sexual harassment.

419
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,039
The real issue
is how men think of women.

420
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,839
It has to change.

421
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,319
We need legislation.

422
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,640
Even if we have a law, some people will still
consider us as a thing.

423
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,440
Pass as many laws as you want,

424
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,440
men will still view women as objects.

425
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,559
something inferior to them.

426
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,920
We have to change.
That's my point.

427
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,680
We, the women
have to change ourselves.

428
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,680
When women change,
society will change

429
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,480
If we are able to grow these ideas

430
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,400
in the minds of every women,
then, believe me, society will change.

431
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,039
Of course, there are
a lot of shitty things

432
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,759
but I think this is easy.

433
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,880
It's not hard. Women are strong.
Women are not weak.

434
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,720
I mean, I'm sure,
when you were inside that red circle,

435
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,759
and in the tent and in the ambulance,

436
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm sure that a part of what
prevented you from being attacked

437
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,319
like the girl that was with you

438
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,160
was your confident reaction.

439
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,400
how you were brought up

440
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,920
and your background

441
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,319
made you react
in a certain way to that situation.

442
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,480
And by the way, when I was...

443
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,759
When our friend told us
what happened to the girl,

444
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,119
we were all moved.

445
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,559
For a long time,
I was imagining this happening to me.

446
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,359
I mean for weeks.

447
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,960
When I'm in the street, and you know
I'm as strong as seven men,

448
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,079
But deep inside I'm afraid.

449
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,480
I have fear inside.
But I try not to show it.

450
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,400
Because if my fear shows,
I'm finished.

451
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,839
I'd be an easy target.

452
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,039
It's better to meet at the protest.

453
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,680
-Are you alone?
-I can go meet her.

454
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,000
Do you prefer to come with us?

455
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,559
instead of going alone.

456
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,759
All right then.

457
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,079
Ok dear, bye.

458
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,400
I'll take my bag.

459
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,039
And put the knife in my jacket.

460
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,359
Look, she's filming us.

461
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,200
Watch out, driver. Watch out!.

462
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,039
It's because of
the harassment incidents?

463
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,440
Not only I will carry a knife.
Many girls will.

464
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,160
So attackers
will get a knife in the guts.

465
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,720
Uncivilized behavior is spreading.

466
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,119
Sexual harassment is not new.
But we never talk about it.

467
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,240
If every girl defends herself...

468
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,839
A lot of girls will carry weapons,

469
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,559
and we'll see who can get near them.

470
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,559
From now on, I will carry a knife.

471
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,160
They say a woman's voice
is shameful!

472
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,839
A woman's voice is revolution!

473
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,599
They say a woman's voice
is shameful.

474
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,680
A woman's voice is revolution!

475
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,680
Raise you voice louder and louder!

476
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,839
Make women's voices heard
in every square!

477
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:03,920
Hey harasser, take off your hand!

478
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,039
Hey harasser, tell your master

479
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,160
We will cut your hands!

480
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,480
If you are asking who we are,

481
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,640
we are the women of the Revolution!

482
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Down! Down!
With the brotherhood government !

483
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,200
Down with the Morshid!

484
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,880
-The Muslim Brotherhood?
-Illegitimate!

485
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,599
-And the Constitution?
-Illegitimate!

486
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,319
-And the election?
-Illegitimate!

487
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,240
-And sexual harassment?
-Illegitimate!

488
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,480
Egypt's women are a red line!

489
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,119
We cannot be disrespected.

490
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,960
Egyptian girls are
the strongest girls in the world!

491
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,920
No one can touch them!
Or dishonor them!

492
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,319
We are strong! We are not weak.
Do you hear, Egyptian men!

493
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:07,599
I say to all women,
''Carry a kitchen knife in the street,

494
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,280
don't let anyone get near you.''

495
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,400
Keep your head high!

496
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,000
You are more honorable
than your oppressor!

497
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,840
They say a woman's voice is shameful!

498
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,639
A woman's voice is revolution!

499
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,400
Why were we born dominated, Mamma?

500
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,440
Imprisoned.

501
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,119
Stifled.

502
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,360
Mamma, what's this diploma?

503
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,360
It's when I was young.

504
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,559
What did you study?

505
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,559
Nutrition.

506
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,000
-You studied nutrition?
-Yes.

507
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,519
-Really?
-Yes.

508
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,400
Don't film me,
I'm uncovered,

509
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,760
You're not uncovered, come on!

510
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,719
We only see your head.

511
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,960
You're wearing a sleeveless top.

512
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,760
But you wouldn't let us
wear cut

513
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
-Why can't we?
-I wore it once for the photo.

514
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,679
You now have a great granddaughter.

515
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,000
She looks like her father.

516
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,239
How does it feel like, Manar,
to be a mom?

517
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,519
An amazing, indescribable feeling.

518
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,119
He didn't attend the wedding it seems.

519
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,119
Did he attend?

520
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,239
Why didn't you go daddy?

521
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,920
Because I was against it.
She is still young.

522
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,519
They arranged a marriage for her.

523
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:14,920
They married her off,
and she is still young.

524
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,400
Are you happy that you're a mom?

525
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:22,599
Or do you think it's still early,
or just normal?

526
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,280
It's nice.

527
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,320
It's nice and not nice.

528
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,119
Why is it nice?
And why is it not nice?

529
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,400
It's nice because it keeps you busy,
when you have nothing to do.

530
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,039
And not nice because...

531
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,280
I'm still young, and not used to this.

532
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,599
That's true.

533
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,119
-Come here.
-You want to film my stomach!

534
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,320
You are the pregnant grandmother!

535
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,280
-Step back so we see you're pregnant,
carrying you daughter's daughter.

536
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,800
Turn this way...how lovely!

537
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,960
Manal, you became a grandmother!

538
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,400
In this picture,
grandma looks so much like you.

539
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,800
Is there anything else
you wanted to do, Mamma, but couldn't?

540
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,280
-Samaher, take out your camera.
-I already did.

541
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,440
He's going to block the way.

542
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,400
He'll ask you why you're filming.

543
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,440
He's an officer.

544
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,519
Let me see what you filmed.

545
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,840
Why are you harassing us?

546
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
-I'm not talking to you.
-I am the one who's filming.

547
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Can we see your ID?

548
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,000
Your zipper's undone, by the way.

549
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,800
So what? I like feeling the air.

550
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,199
Give me the camera.

551
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,000
I won't give you the camera.

552
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,159
-Really?
-No, I won't.

553
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,199
Bring me the camera.
Stop the cars.

554
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,840
Go ahead and stop all the cars!

555
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,960
I won't give you the camera.

556
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,639
Your zipper is open,
and you want my camera?

557
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,360
Why are you following us?

558
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,159
-Want to know why I am filming?
-Why?

559
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,079
The guys behind were harassing us.

560
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,159
-Who was harassing you?
-You are one of them.

561
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,960
We were on the road, sweetheart.

562
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,639
Get lost!

563
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:55,679
Go, go!

564
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,159
Careful

565
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,159
Strong girl!

566
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:11,920
Yes!

567
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,360
You are unbelievable!

568
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,960
I never saw something like that!

569
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,239
I did it!

570
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes!

571
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,719
Crazy, crazy, crazy,

572
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,880
We are crazy.

573
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,719
Did you see?

574
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,920
It is a revolution to question
what it means to be a woman.

575
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,119
The issue is the wrong understanding

576
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,320
of femininity.

577
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,679
To me the issue is what it means
to be a man or a woman?

578
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,480
That was my point.

579
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,960
Why does our identity as women

580
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,440
make us feel weak?

581
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:36,480
Because we suffer from constant

582
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,000
gender oppression by men,

583
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,599
in our society.

584
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,320
So a lot of our energy

585
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
is going into opposing men.

586
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,119
I am stared at
because of my tits and my ass?

587
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,159
Because of my top?

588
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,679
Well, let a man come and show me
what he's going to do about it!

589
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,320
You, Samaher, Salma, Rasha, and I
are resisting.

590
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,800
We're being very courageous out there.

591
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
We are not afraid.

592
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,519
It's as if we are fighting,
because we are women,

593
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,920
for something we didn't choose to be.

594
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,760
Something we can't change,
because this is who we are.

595
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,280
The issue is not
being a man or a woman.

596
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,800
It is about being a human being.

597
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,679
That's all.

598
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,360
Here I am theorizing!

599
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,960
How the hell did it flip over?

600
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,840
How did this happen?

601
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,519
-Was there anyone inside?
-No. No one.

602
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,960
-Hello.
-Hi.

603
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,880
Hi, how are you?

604
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,039
Wow, nice!

605
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,000
-This is new, right?
-I love this one.

606
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,800
Yes, this is new.

607
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:46,719
Your drawing about sexual harassment,

608
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,119
it's very powerful.
It stirs your feelings.

609
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,079
This reminds me
of the Sayeda Zeinab demonstration.

610
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,960
When women went to the protest
holding knives.

611
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,880
Every drawing you were making...
No flattery...

612
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,360
Every drawing made me feel
like we were on the right track.

613
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,000
This is what made me start my project.

614
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,199
I felt a change was possible.

615
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:20,119
You did the drawings,
another talked about her experience.

616
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,119
Other girls started taking photos.

617
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,039
This is the beginning
of something great.

618
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,599
The women's rage is beautiful.

619
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,639
-It is full of hope
-Yes.

620
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,199
I'm just thinking about the idea of...

621
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,960
Feeling the need to have a shawl on
when you go out.

622
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,480
At first, we feared
they would impose the hijab on us.

623
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,920
But, this is not what worries me most.

624
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:56,599
It's rather the idea that we'll end up
wearing it without even noticing.

625
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:00,159
Five years ago,
I used to go out bare-armed.

626
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:02,159
Now, I put on a shawl instinctively.

627
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,199
Then gradually,
I'll start covering my hair,

628
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,440
and my face.

629
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:10,199
And not leave the house
-without even noticing.

630
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,360
I never felt so vulnerable before.

631
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,000
To me it was a shock,

632
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,960
as I suddenly realized
what it meant to be a woman,

633
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,639
in this country,
but also in general.

634
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,559
It is destabilizing
when you start thinking about

635
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:38,440
something self-evident.

636
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:44,599
As if you 're forced to think
about having five fingers

637
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,159
I AM WITH THE ARAB
WOMEN'S REBELLION

638
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,199
BECAUSE WE ARE
THE REVOLUTIONARY WOMB

639
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,880
WOMEN OF THE WORLD
GIVE BIRTH TO CHILDREN

640
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,639
EGYPTIAN WOMEN
GIVE BIRTH TO HEROES

641
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:04,880
We were at the
Attorney General's office,

642
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,280
to submit complaints
against the President

643
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,199
for his shameful silence.

644
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,199
It is a disgrace.
It is an insult to remain silent

645
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,639
in the face of violence against women.

646
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,840
The more they will attack us,

647
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,880
and attack our bodies and our rights,

648
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,320
the more we will escalate back

649
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,679
to reclaim our rights.

650
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,719
We won't stay silent any more.

651
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,800
What will we say to Morsi?

652
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,679
Resign!

653
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,599
We will not forget that tomorrow,
March 9th, is the anniversary

654
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,039
of all the brave girls,

655
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,800
who stood against the police,
and who were virginity tested.

656
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,639
What will we say to them?

657
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:02,280
I'm not afraid
like I was in the past!

658
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,400
There are still women in the squares!

659
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,480
The women have said their word!

660
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:19,400
They will trample the Morshid!

661
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:21,920
The women said it loud!

662
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,519
We don't want the Brotherhood!

663
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,440
Yes, I'm chanting
against the Morshid!

664
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,559
No matter how,
we will bring Morsi down!

665
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,800
I was in the middle
of all those women, Mamma,

666
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,599
I felt strong and brave.

667
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,519
and tore out all the anger
that's been inside me for years.

668
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,079
I was among them,

669
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,360
and with them.

670
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,360
And thanks to them,

671
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,280
I went deep inside myself.

672
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:42,320
Here...

673
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,159
...in this hallway,

674
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,840
your screams echo in my head,

675
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,920
that day when your son dragged me,
holding a knife in his right hand,

676
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,880
and pulling my hair with his left.

677
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,039
That day is engraved in my memory.

678
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:07,400
You wanted to kill me
because of a photo.

679
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,119
I remember very well.

680
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,519
I spent 3 days
sleeping under the bed from fear.

681
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,559
A whole year locked down in the house.

682
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,920
Six months of silence,

683
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:34,599
You used to say to dad,

684
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,199
''You spoiled that girl.''

685
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,119
Why did he spoil me?

686
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:44,679
Because he never
lifted his hand against me?

687
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,480
Or is it because he thought
girls should be educated.

688
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,239
DEAR SAMAHER,
CONGRATULATIONS.

689
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,760
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED

690
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,519
BY THE EGYPTIAN HIGHER
INSTITUTE OF CINEMA STUDIES

691
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,559
She wants to travel?

692
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,280
If she mentions travelling
and study again, she's dead.

693
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,639
Where does she think
she comes from?

694
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,639
Calm down. It's God's will.

695
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,880
She's listening to you,
and I will also talk to her.

696
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,719
I told myself in order
to survive

697
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,920
I had to escape and fly away.

698
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,679
Someday, I'll be
who I want to be

699
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,000
That's it.

700
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,840
Careful with the wing.

701
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:37,800
Pull!

702
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,280
How did it got tangled up like that?

703
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,559
Great, Rasha!

704
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:23,159
When the Brotherhood arrests you!

705
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:28,039
Shout for help, don't be afraid!

706
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:33,159
Tell the Morshid to go away!

707
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:38,519
If we are one, ten or a hundred,

708
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,119
we will shout and make it loud!

709
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:55,599
HONK IF YOU HATE
THE BROTHERHOOD

710
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,559
WE WANT A FREE COUNTRY
NOT A BROTHERHOOD COUNTRY

711
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,599
We are here to prepare
against any sexual harassment

712
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,880
that might happen
on June 30th, 2013.

713
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,760
I'm going to show a short,
three-minute film.

714
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,079
We hope that this won't happen again,
in Egypt, or anywhere on earth.

715
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,639
A girl is trapped inside this circle.

716
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:36,679
She is being sexually assaulted.

717
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,199
These girls are being gang-raped.

718
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,800
Those girls thought
they will never get out alive.

719
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,800
But we won't keep silent.
We won't be broken.

720
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,400
This revolution is ours,

721
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,599
and we will fight
until our last breath.

722
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,280
The first means for self-defense
is to be strong yourself.

723
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:00,000
Second,
in your bag is your defense kit:

724
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,800
A deodorant or a perfume spray,
or a Hijab pin.

725
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,000
You use the strap
of the bra for the pin

726
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,199
Like this.

727
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,719
You see.

728
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,400
You wear your shirt on top.

729
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,639
Imagine it under there,
and I'am wearing a shirt on top.

730
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,679
There is the tip that doesn't cut.

731
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:27,239
If someone is attacking me
from the front or from behind...

732
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:31,000
And if it is more than one, Janet?

733
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,800
Try to hurt as many
as you can!

734
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,440
You do what you can.

735
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,880
Down with the Morshid!

736
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,360
You sold the Revolution,
Mohamed Badiea!

737
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,480
Sell Sell Sell!
The Revolution ya Badiea!

738
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,960
Down with the Morshid!

739
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,800
Look at these men.
I am filming you.

740
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,559
Three girls are worth a 100 men.

741
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:19,800
Don't even think of getting near them.

742
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,360
Without them, you are useless.

743
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,599
You are just standing there, watching.

744
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:26,519
Why don't you chant with them?

745
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,440
If you don't want the Brotherhood,
chant with them.

746
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:34,960
Come and shoot us with your snipers!

747
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:39,400
There's still room in my chest
for a bullet!

748
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,360
You can muzzle our freedom!

749
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,599
Shameful Morshid
and lying President.

750
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,679
Write on all the walls!

751
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,000
The President is lying to us!

752
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,800
You pretend to be the Guide!

753
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,320
But you're only a phony President!

754
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,719
We don't want them
to do this to us again.

755
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,119
If anything happens, call.
We'll come right away.

756
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,800
Keep our number with you

757
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,039
I want to go up

758
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:31,599
Grab her.

759
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,920
I want to.

760
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,599
Wait a minute.

761
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,400
What? Why can't I film?

762
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,119
No no no

763
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,639
Why?

764
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,199
-She should not film.
-Why?

765
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,280
Why shouldn't I?

766
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,280
Don't film.

767
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:50,320
Why don't you want me to film?

768
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,920
There are all these cameras around...

769
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:55,280
I'm asking you.

770
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,199
Don't film what's hapenning here.

771
00:56:58,199 --> 00:56:59,960
-Don't film.
-Why not?

772
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:00,920
I'm asking you.

773
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,199
Don't touch me!

774
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:03,599
-Look, see!
-Wait, wait!

775
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,000
Yes, I'm leaving.

776
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,440
That guy is one of them.

777
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,599
Instead of telling me
not to film,

778
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:14,559
go protect the Egyptian women.

779
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:17,719
If you were true men,
you'd go protect the women!

780
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,599
I want to expose
what these guys are doing.

781
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:23,760
You are just standing here,

782
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,239
while young women
are being assaulted right there.

783
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,440
Are you real men or what!

784
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,679
Of all the people with cameras,
they picked on me.

785
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,880
I want to go on top of this building
to shoot.

786
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,079
How can I get on top?

787
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,320
Can you see this amazing scene, Mamma?

788
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,440
It was like a dream

789
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,199
but real.

790
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,000
I was very curious,

791
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,000
to go and see what they
do there

792
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,400
inside the red circle.

793
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,440
I felt I wanted to freeze the image
in front of me

794
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:23,360
In order to be a witness,

795
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:25,960
and have proof.

796
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,320
In order not to forget.

797
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,920
To be able to decide for ourselves,

798
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:56,159
and be able to...

799
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,960
That's a surprise.

800
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,119
We didn't know
he was making a speech.

801
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,360
-It's coming from outside and inside.
-A lot louder outside!

802
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,000
Unbelievable!

803
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,000
I shall not tolerate

804
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,280
that we be attacked.

805
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,280
The cafés are empty.

806
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:18,239
No one's listening.

807
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,280
Egypt will continue
with its legitimate people,

808
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,679
institutions, President, and laws

809
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,599
Resign! Resign!

810
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,119
Resign! Resign!

811
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:47,880
Resign! Resign!

812
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,159
They're Brotherhood members.

813
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,800
Wait, Zeinab, don't get too close.

814
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,079
I'm scared.

815
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,840
-What if people start to run away?
-We'll also run, that way.

816
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:13,559
Come on!

817
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:17,840
Leave me alone!

818
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,480
They're shooting bullets.

819
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:28,599
You sons of bitches!

820
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,039
They will make the
country fall

821
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:17,800
The country is falling
because of one man.

822
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,960
They shot real bullets,
and shotgun pellets.

823
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,360
What can we do?

824
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,000
They created chaos.

825
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:29,760
The army will clean them up.

826
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,599
The Army told the people to come out.

827
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,000
They want the world to know
it's not a coup.

828
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,760
That's what the people want.
I have goosebumps.

829
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,320
They took advantage of the situation.

830
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,639
Once the protesters
got what they wanted, they went home.

831
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,639
The people who are protesting now
are pro-Morsi.

832
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,039
Are you enjoying seeing me like this?

833
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,639
What is happening?

834
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,800
We cant' leave the square!

835
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,480
Sit down.

836
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,199
Our friends are getting killed !

837
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,159
We will return there, calm down.

838
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,719
Let go of me!

839
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:19,599
Free revolutionaries!
We will complete the journey

840
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,800
Free revolutionaries!
We will complete the journey!

841
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
Revolution until victory comes!

842
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:31,599
Revolution in every street!

843
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,480
We won't give up, we won't betray!

844
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,320
We won't leave Egypt
to that dog Badiea.

845
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,599
During the last months,
the armed forces

846
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:12,840
strived to set an agreement

847
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,320
between the diverse political forces,

848
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,639
including the President.

849
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,639
But the speech of Mr. President,
yesterday evening,

850
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,960
did not fulfill
the demands of the people.

851
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:35,239
This has lead the armed forces
to consult

852
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,039
with some of the national
and political parties.

853
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:43,840
The parties agreed
on the following roadmap:

854
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:48,159
The current constitution
will be revoked.

855
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,440
An early presidential election
will be held.

856
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:57,480
In the meanwhile,
the president of the supreme court,

857
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:03,320
will take charge of the country
during this transitional period.

858
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,760
We did it!
The people brought down the regime!

859
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,559
They are doing this
to provoke the army.

860
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
If they attack the army,
they'll have to respond

861
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,679
Listen to her.

862
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:13,280
They are trying to make the West think
there's a military coup.

863
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,880
They, the Brotherhood.

864
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,960
This is why Morsi sent
his supporters to the streets,

865
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,920
to show that he has
as many supporters,

866
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,199
and that people are backing him.

867
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,760
So the army must absolutely not
get involved now.

868
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,599
The army has to let them attack
and cause deaths,

869
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,039
so as to justify its intervention.

870
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:40,960
The army cannot confront
peaceful protesters.

871
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,239
Look, here they come!

872
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,119
With God's will,
we will vanquish them.

873
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:49,719
The army is acting very respectfully.

874
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,480
You have to trust the army.

875
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:56,159
Now,
we need to trust the army.

876
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,119
We were full of hopes.

877
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,599
We could bring mountains down,

878
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,400
and rebuild them again.

879
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:25,239
Our cry for freedom
reached the sky,

880
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:29,119
until it broke and shattered us.

881
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:38,400
As for us women,
we got overwhelmed by our dreams.

882
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,840
And each one of us went a different way.

883
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:12,800
How many more conversations
we would have had?

884
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
Mamma.

885
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,199
A lot of time needed to pass,

886
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,199
but it was too late

887
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,880
for me to be able to talk to you.

888
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,639
I am sad I lost you.

889
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:40,440
Not only because we weren't able
to have all those conversations,

890
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:51,239
but also because,
for 60 years of your life,

891
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,320
your lungs never had
a chance to breathe.

892
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,800
You died suffocating, Mamma.

893
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:13,280
You died not knowing
even one of your rights.

894
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,920
Not the rights
made by courts and laws,

895
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:26,039
but your rights
as a mother to this earth.

896
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:30,239
There are things one can't buy.

897
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,239
The right to life,

898
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,439
for the one who gives life.

899
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,640
Can you make the dishes
shine like that?

900
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,039
I don't have the patience.

901
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:48,000
It's Nabulsi soap,
made from olive oil.

902
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,560
See how shiny it is?

903
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,000
You have nothing else to do.

904
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,920
Look at me, all.

905
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,560
What do you think, Manal?

906
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,640
Careful, the photos!

907
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,079
Each one take a photo and describe it.

908
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,760
There are old photos.

909
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,760
Some are missing by the way.

910
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,880
Look at dad. He was slim.

911
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,520
Where was it?

912
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,279
Father Christmas!

913
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:44,000
He looks like Amir.

914
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,000
I want this photo!

915
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:49,359
-Neither of you.
-I want it!

916
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,560
Where have you been?

917
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,840
-I want to go to sleep.
-Go ahead.

918
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,600
You didn't sit with us
when we were looking at the photos.

919
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,279
I don't want to think about the past.

920
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,079
You were so handsome
when you were young

921
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,000
Don't you agree, Soha?

922
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,479
That's me!

923
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,520
This is Mamma.

924
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,520
So beautiful.

925
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:32,600
So you didn't like the film?

926
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,479
What did you see in the film
apart from me smoking?

927
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:45,399
Maybe you needed to leave
to find peace.

928
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,039
I wasn't able to see you.

929
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,279
or smell you one last time

930
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:08,520
-That was the first time, right?
-Yes.

931
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,079
Tell me about it.

932
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,600
It was the first time
I went to the cinema.

933
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,640
Because I'didn't want to upset you.

934
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,760
I was ill.

935
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,680
I didn't want to go.

936
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,800
But I went in order not to upset you.

937
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:24,359
How did it feel
to be for the first time in a cinema?

938
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,039
I sat and I watched.

939
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:35,079
The only thing left of you
is your hair.

940
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:40,359
It was the first time
my mother goes to the cinema.

941
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:44,000
I had to film her and ask her
what she thinks of cinema.

942
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:48,520
It was quiet.
No one was talking.

943
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,920
Everyone was quiet, watching.

944
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:57,800
I took your braid with your bow.

945
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,199
Because your hands
were the last to touch it.

946
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,439
I miss you.

947
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,199
So much.

948
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:48,520
Man, there goes the neighborhood.

949
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,319
Actually Manal also,
-the maid...

950
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,800
She is for al-Sissi.

951
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,520
Yesterday, she told me
there were protests in Talaat Harb.

952
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,239
It was very big, the police was there,

953
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:08,239
and all the trucks came.

954
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:11,479
She told me all the Brotherhood
were in Talaat Harb.

955
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,399
I told her the Brotherhood
never came to downtown.

956
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,199
They don't come to Talaat Harb,
those are revolutionaries.

957
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:24,159
She said, ''No, there is no revolution,
they were Brotherhood.''

958
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,840
I said, ''Why do you say this?''

959
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,399
She said, ''Because they
were saying 'Down with Sissi'''.

960
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,840
I said, ''A lot of people say this,
not just the Brotherhood.''

961
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:49,159
Hallo!

962
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,520
Are you filming?

963
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,359
How about the battery?

964
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,119
That just tells you
how much battery is left.

965
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,479
-Two batteries left.
-Two bars.

966
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,760
We need to charge it.

967
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:05,039
Just a little.
Not now.

968
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,640
-Is Ram there?
-You can move it.

969
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,119
-Is Ram there, Zein?
-I can see him.

970
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,560
I can see him.

971
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:27,279
It's hard to breathe.

972
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,319
The air won't go into my chest.

973
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,079
You were dying there.

974
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,880
And I was giving birth here.

975
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,560
And in my mind, questions grow.

976
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,399
What future awaits my children?

977
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,439
How will I raise them, and not fall
into the hole I was raised in?

978
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,159
In my womb,

979
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:34,159
My soul is tied

980
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,479
to your soul.

981
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,600
I gasped,

982
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,399
and created your soul.

983
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,399
It is written,
''I kissed mama, on her eye, her hair,

984
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,600
''and everything. And her leg,
and Ram's leg.''

985
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:15,800
Wow!

986
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,000
-All this is for you.
-All these kisses for me?

987
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,319
and you can borrow my stuff

988
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:27,399
-What is it, Mamma?
-The police are chasing them.

989
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:32,079
They were at the demonstration.

990
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,560
What's a demonstration?

991
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,159
They are running away.
They always run there.

992
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,319
But what's a demonstration?

993
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,000
It's when people...
I'll explain to you later.

994
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,039
The police are running after them.

995
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,680
Move your head

996
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,319
Hey, beautiful.

997
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,000
-What?
-You're beautiful.

998
01:18:31,159 --> 01:18:32,960
-Thanks.
-Very beautiful.

999
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,560
Let's have a quick fuck.

1000
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,439
What?

1001
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,840
I'll walk behind you,
just like you do.

1002
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:51,079
I'll bother you,
just like you bother me.

1003
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:53,560
I'll stay on your back.

1004
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:58,800
So you can feel how we feel
when you're following us.

1005
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:00,800
-I'll stalk you.
-You can stay forever.

1006
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,279
I'm going to follow you.

1007
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,640
Just like boys follow girls,
now girls will follow boys.

1008
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,760
I won't leave him alone.
I live upstairs, by the way.

1009
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,239
-Did anyone talk to you?
-No one talked to me.

1010
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,800
-So I'm the problem?
-Go wear decent clothes.

1011
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,800
I will wear whatever I please!

1012
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,800
Mind your own business!

1013
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,119
I am free. I do what I want.

1014
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:24,640
Why should I stop.?
Don't you get harassed too?

1015
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,479
It's OK.

1016
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,560
No, it's not.
I'll wait for him outside.

1017
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,439
I'll follow you till the end of time.

1018
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,880
Waiting for him outside.

1019
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,720
What do you want?

1020
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,800
You're the one who's talking to me.

1021
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:45,079
-She was arguing with a customer.
-Did I talk to you?

1022
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:47,640
-She's making a fuss.
-None of your business.

1023
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,439
-I'm a free woman.
-Be polite or I'll beat you.

1024
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:52,079
Did I talk to you?

1025
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,960
You'd better be polite
or I'll beat you up in public.

1026
01:19:56,119 --> 01:19:58,039
You're going to beat me?

1027
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,000
-It's ok, madam.
-You should talk to him.

1028
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:05,199
-Am I wrong to ask her to be polite?
-I'm not afraid of raising my voice!

1029
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,600
A women's voice is not shameful.
You are shameful.

1030
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,279
-I want to record you.
-Okay, go ahead.

1031
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:38,640
-Do you know what happened?
-Yes.

1032
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:42,600
What happened?

1033
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,600
I don't wont to do it anymore.

1034
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:51,359
-I don't want to do that at all.
-Don't take someone to the police.

1035
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,720
What?

1036
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,279
You don't have to take
someone to the police.

1037
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,239
It's not like very, very bad.

1038
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,840
You think
it's not bad what he did to me?

1039
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:03,840
I said, it's not very very very bad.

1040
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:06,199
For me, it's very very very bad.

1041
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:09,800
-Okay.
-I don't like anybody to touch me.

1042
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,119
I can touch you?

1043
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:15,600
You're not anybody, you're my son.

1044
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:20,039
He's just some guy in the street,
who grabbed me.

1045
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:22,479
Do you think this is okay?

1046
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,520
-What?
-Hey, what happened?

1047
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:29,319
Zein thinks it is not that bad so as
to take the guy to the police station.

1048
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:32,359
-This is what he thinks.
-No, I mean...

1049
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,520
And he started to cry.

1050
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:36,960
So when he cried I had to leave.

1051
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:38,159
I was scared.

1052
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:43,319
There were 50 or more guys
surrounding me,

1053
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,399
I'm grabbing the guy
to take him to the police station.

1054
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,439
I beat him in his face.

1055
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:53,640
And everyone was, like,
''It's over, you beat him.''

1056
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,800
''Your son is crying, go home.''

1057
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,520
''It's wrong that you hit him.''

1058
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:05,119
After he grabbed me from my ass,
he said it was wrong I beat him

1059
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:09,920
I said, ''You're telling me I'm wrong,
but you're not telling him he's wrong.''

1060
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:13,880
It is not okay for some random guy
to grab anybody,

1061
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:16,279
or any of us, especially your mom.

1062
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:17,439
Okay.

1063
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:20,760
If anybody does that again,
you go and you kick him.

1064
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,119
-That's what she said.
-Yeah.

1065
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,920
Zein asked me, ''Why did he do that?''

1066
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:30,600
What should I tell him?

1067
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,279
Because of some stupid,
uneducated idiot?

1068
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,479
Who grabs girls asses in the street?

1069
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:45,039
He said,
''Let's go live somewhere else.''

1070
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,079
I wanted to record because I got hurt.

1071
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,000
And I want my son
to understand what happened.

1072
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:53,960
Why did I get hurt?

1073
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:57,279
I don't want my son to think
I am a crazy woman,

1074
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:00,439
fighting with people in the street
like many people think.

1075
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,720
It's not the first time it happened
when he was with me.

1076
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,800
The other time he was
a baby in the stroller.

1077
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,920
I would yell,
and no one could understand why.

1078
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:13,039
Two things drive me mad.

1079
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:15,319
First, that Zein was with me.

1080
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:19,920
Second, that I'm at home,
while the guy walks away free.

1081
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:23,399
I didn't want anyone
to beat him.

1082
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,359
A guy was hitting him.
I didn't want anybody to beat him.

1083
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,600
I just wanted
to take him to the police.

1084
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:32,399
Enough.

1085
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:35,840
Enough.

1086
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:01,680
I don't know if I was lucky
to be born a girl.

1087
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,880
But I know that I'm fully aware

1088
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:08,359
of the power and strength I derive

1089
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,680
from being born a girl.

1090
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,880
And I think, in the end,
that's what makes all the difference.

1091
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,039
Resistance and survival
are a blessing.

1092
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,279
and Blessing is your name.
