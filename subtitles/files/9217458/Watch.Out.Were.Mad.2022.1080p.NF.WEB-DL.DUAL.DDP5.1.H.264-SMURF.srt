00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,750
<i>A long time ago,</i>

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,666
<i>two friends took part
in an incredible race.</i>

3
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,625
<i>And together, they won first prize,</i>

4
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,375
<i>a red dune buggy with a yellow soft top.</i>

5
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,416
<i>Given that sharing it equally
was out of the question,</i>

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,083
<i>they wagered it
on a beer and hot dog eating contest.</i>

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,708
<i>But at the crucial moment,
a bad guy who was terrorizing the area</i>

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,583
<i>destroyed the bar they were eating in
and set fire to the dune buggy.</i>

9
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,416
<i>And so the two friends got mad,</i>

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,916
<i>and after smacks and slaps,
punches and blows,</i>

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,083
<i>the bad guy ended up buying them
two brand new dune buggies.</i>

12
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,375
<i>One each. Red with a yellow soft top.</i>

13
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,833
<i>But one of the dune buggies caught fire,
so only one remained.</i>

14
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,625
<i>And given that sharing it equally
was out of the question,</i>

15
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,583
<i>our two heroes kept fighting</i>

16
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,583
<i>over that dune buggy.</i>

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,875
You're always so stubborn.

18
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,666
It was all your fault.

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,375
You know very well that isn't true.

20
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,666
You crashed into me.

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,666
I crashed into you...
I was only distracted for a second.

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,333
- Looking at that woman.
- What woman?

23
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,375
Nobody moves from here
until this is resolved.

24
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,875
Okay. Shall we play cards for it?

25
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,958
With a cheater? Let's arm wrestle instead.

26
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,458
- Now you're offending me.
- I'm too strong for you, huh?

27
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,916
Yeah, you wish!

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,041
How about we sort this out the usual way?

29
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,500
Beer and hot dogs?

30
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,958
No, not this time.

31
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,500
Let's have another race.

32
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,083
A race? You really want to lose, then.

33
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:02,333
If a car hadn't crashed into me,
I would've won.

34
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,208
Dad, are you gonna be long?

35
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,500
- Not now!
- Not now!

36
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,583
And don't you dare touch the car!

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,000
You're always making excuses.

38
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,958
Hey, come here!

39
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,333
But this is a dune buggy.

40
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,416
1200cc engine, 41 horsepower.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,958
This goes over 140 km an hour.

42
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,833
Oh yeah.

43
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,375
What are you doing? Get out!

44
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,083
- Or what?
- Or Dad'll get mad.

45
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,125
He's already mad.

46
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,916
It doesn't matter.
Besides, this isn't our car.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,333
"This isn't our car."

48
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,833
I don't talk like that!

49
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,000
- "I don't talk like that."
- Will you stop?

50
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,375
"Will you stop?"

51
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,208
Stop!

52
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,583
What if I let you drive first?

53
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,791
Where are you going? Get back here!

54
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,875
I said not to touch it!

55
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,458
I'm gonna kill them.

56
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,916
NETFLIX PRESENTS

57
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,791
I wouldn't stop.

58
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,083
- What if it were me in trouble?
- Do I have to answer that?

59
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,666
Thanks, guys.

60
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,083
We've run out of gas.

61
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,750
Nice car.

62
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,000
Aren't you too young to drive?

63
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,500
Aren't you ashamed
of driving around in that wreck?

64
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,625
The bike has a name. Bolt.

65
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,458
And nobody bad-mouths Bolt.

66
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,375
- Can I have a go?
- No.

67
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,416
How about this...

68
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,875
If you win, Bolt is yours.

69
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,875
What are we meant to do with a two-stroke?

70
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,333
- Let him finish.
- Get off me.

71
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,958
If I win, you let me
take a ride in your car. You in?

72
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,041
- No.
- Deal!

73
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,625
Okay, the Virgin Mary wins,
St. Anthony and St. Januarius lose.

74
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,791
Watch.

75
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,708
At least pay attention.

76
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,791
This one loses.

77
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,875
This one wins.

78
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,666
Saint Anthony loses.

79
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,750
This one wins.

80
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,541
Does this win or lose? I can't remember.

81
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
This one wins.

82
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,083
Where's the Virgin Mary?

83
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,500
I think you're out of luck.

84
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,333
Get I...

85
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,000
The dealer always wins.

86
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,458
You only had to pay attention!

87
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,458
He'll be back.

88
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Yeah, for sure.

89

91
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,083
Nice doggy.

92
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,291
Hi, doggy.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey, <i>karasho.</i>

94
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,166
At least you have a friend. Lovely.

95
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,458
Come here, Geremia.

96
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,375
My goodness, so grumpy. Like a bear.

97
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,666
- How much?
- Fifty.

98
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,500
Fifty?

99
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,875
What a thief.

100
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,916
I'm a thief?

101
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,708
Okay, here you go.

102
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Fifty.

103
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,375
The Cobras.

104
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,625
Fuck, the Cobras!

105
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,458
- It's the Cobras!
- Run away!

WOLAND CIRCUS

CRAZY 4 RALLY

108
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,125
FIRST PRIZE: DUNE BUGGY

109
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,875
Where are you going?

110
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,166
Let me go!

111
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,500
- I like feisty women.
- Oh yeah?

112
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,000
Does your boyfriend know?

113
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,083
You have two days to sign and leave.

114
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,666
Torsillo has lost his patience!

115
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,333
Two days!

116
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,416
Two!

117
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,625
Hey.

118
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,000
I've had it with you too.

119
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,458
Hey, fatso. You heard what I said, right?

120
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,833
Hurt him, Scajo!

121
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,583
Let me go.

122
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,625
Now he'll batter him.

123
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,416
Kill him!

124
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,666
Where are you going?

125
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,416
I'll get the money next time.

126
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,250
Let me go!

127
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,541
The coward runs away!

128
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,583
Let me go!

129
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,708
Thanks, you can drop me here!

130
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,625
You thought you could cheat us?

131
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,083
Next time, you're dead!

132
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,958
SMILEY

133
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,000
Ta-da!

134
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,666
I'm good. How are you?

135
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,166
Not even a hug?

136
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,375
Come on, come here!

137
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,375
I get it. You don't want to talk to me.

138
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,916
But I'm convinced

139
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,750
that you've seen it too.

140
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,250
We can get it back together, you and I.

141
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,500
Isn't it a great idea?

142
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,708
But why?

143
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,916
Is that how things are?

144
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,166
Fine, I'll win the buggy alone!

145
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,958
And if I win,
I won't give it to you! It'll be all mine!

146
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,250
I'll keep the kart for myself!

147
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,708
And welcome to Crazy 4 Rally!

148
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,583
A cutthroat race.

149
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,625
A blaze of insanity,
gas, and testosterone.

150
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,083
How pumped are you, folks?

151
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,750
Remember why we're here.

152
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

153
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,583
the man who needs no introduction.

154
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,333
A man blessed
with the divine gift of charisma.

155
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,375
A man so handsome

156
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,833
that when he looks in the mirror,
he'd kiss himself!

157
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,416
What's this guy on about?

158
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,708
Basically, let's give a big round
of applause for Flavio Torsillo!

159
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,375
Enough.

160
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,791
Hi. Go for it.

161
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,000
Good luck. May the best man win.

162
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,333
Is he dense?

163
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Good luck.

164
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,500
And this race is even more special
because of a spectacular prize,

165
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,041
a 1974 dune buggy!

166
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,750
Who will win?

167
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,125
Who will be the most reckless driver?

168
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,333
So, are we ready to rumble?

169
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,208
Five,

170
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,625
four,

171
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,500
three,

172
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,833
two,

173
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,458
one!

174
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,791
Come on!

175
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,125
Damn it!

176
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,250
See you later!

177
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,000
How pumped are you?

178
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,916
Perfect! That's the spirit!

179
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,958
It's stuck, for fuck's sake!

180
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,041
No, he's hopeless.

181
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,250
Scajone, let's go.

182
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,208
- Aren't you gonna watch your son?
- What's there to see?

183
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,083
Put your hat on. Open the door.

184
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,708
<i>Wow! Insane!</i>

185
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,208
<i>I cannot believe my eyes!
Plot twist, folks!</i>

186
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,833
The cars have rolled over.
Where are the drivers?

187
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,208
Damn it.

188
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,500
There they are!
They're continuing on foot, folks!

189
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,583
The first race without cars!

190
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,750
And without an audience!
I'm the only one still here.

191
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,000
Unfair shouldering! A few meters to go!

192
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,666
Here they are,
about to reach the finish line.

193
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,375
They've done it, folks!

194
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,625
Mine!

195
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,708
Champions!

196
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,541
Super champions!

197
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:39,833
So, how does it feel
to win a 1974 dune buggy?

198
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,500
Exactly! That's the spirit!

199
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:48,166
I don't want to destroy these emotions.
I'll go and get the champagne.

200
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,416
Champions!

201
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,083
Good, keep working.

202
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,000
It was all set up for me to win.

203
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,625
All the cars were the same,
only my engine was souped-up.

204
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,541
I really don't know how I lost.

205
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,625
What did you say?

206
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,833
- That the cars were the same.
- No, after that.

207
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,333
I said that mine was souped-up.

208
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,416
After that.

209
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,833
After that...

210
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,458
What did I say after that, Dad?

211
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,958
From the outside, someone may
have got the impression that you lost.

212
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,541
But that's only an impression.

213
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,708
No. But I really did lose, Dad.

214
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,041
You were there too.

215
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,500
In a race, fairness doesn't count.
Only the result counts.

216
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,875
A Torsillo never accepts losing.

217
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,458
That's why we always win.

218
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,666
Come with Dad. Come on.

219
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,291
Those guys have the car?
So you go and take it.

220
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,000
They won't just give it to me.
They'll never give it to me.

221
00:19:59,083 --> 00:19:59,958
Of course not.

222
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,958
It's not like you go and say,
"Excuse me, can I please have it?"

223
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,083
Just mention the name Torsillo,
and they'll shit themselves.

224
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,125
And it's more fun getting things
when you don't deserve them!

225
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,666
"Torsillo."

226
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,250
Raniero, your father
is in a similar position.

227
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,000
He wants the land.
They won't give it to him.

228
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,458
Sure, it's their land.

229
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,833
So, what does Dad do?

230
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,541
Alfredo, how are you?

231
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,458
I can't feel my feet anymore.

232
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,791
Of course, honey. You've been locked
in a fridge for two hours.

233
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,750
It's best you accept quickly,
before your brain freezes.

234
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,083
I'm not selling.

235
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,750
That's my home.

236
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,125
When I say a clean job,
I mean a clean job.

237
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,208
Right.

238
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,791
I'll have to throw all the meat out
if he infects it with his germs.

239
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,041
- Right?
- Right.

240
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,541
What is it?

241
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,625
Excuse me.

242
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,250
- The cold, I don't know.
- Who did he take after?

243
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,666
Who'd he take after? Go on, close it.

244
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,375
No!

245
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,916
But why? I only wanted to take a ride.

246
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,833
Why?

247
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,875
Because until we resolve this,

248
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,750
the kart isn't moving from here.

249
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,958
- Oh yeah?
- Oh yeah.

250
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,958
You know I can take it
even without the keys if I want?

251
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,458
Really?

252
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:54,916
Go on, then.

253
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,791
Hold up.

254
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,083
If you find the joker, the buggy's yours.

255
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,125
Once was enough for me.

256
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,666
I don't play with cheats.

257
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,666
Watch it, I might get offended.

258
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,750
What if we settle it like the old days?

259
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,791
Like the old days?

260
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,125
I'm on a diet.

261
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,208
Hang on.

262
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,666
Fine, I get it.

263
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,250
- But what kind of diet?
- Dissociated.

264
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,333
Like you?

265
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,833
How long's it been since you cleaned?

266
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,333
This place is lacking a feminine touch.

267
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,375
Are you seeing anyone?

268
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,541
- Geremia, it's ready!
- No, apart from Geremia, I mean.

269
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,458
All right. I'm in.

270
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,500
Like the old days.

271
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,583
Just stay quiet. And still.

272
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,083
All right. But I'm driving.

273
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,125
They came back again.

274
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,916
Goddamn Cobras.

275
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,666
You've changed the decor.

276
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,125
What can I get you?

277
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,041
So, let's see...

278
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,625
Twenty pints and 20 hot dogs.

279
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,666
And 40 hot dogs.

280
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,500
And a vanilla ice cream. Thanks.

281
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,708
Ice cream cleanses.

282
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:58,833
Miriam.

283
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,791
<i>Karasho!</i>

284
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,583
They trashed everything.

285
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,833
They trashed the circus,
and you're here eating würstel?

286
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,958
What kind of man are you?

287
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,916
You're worse than the Cobras.

288
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,250
Don't let me see you again.

289
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,833
What are you looking at?

290
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,791
You must be a thief.

291
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
A thief? Me?

292
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,291
'Cause you've stolen my heart.

293
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,125
Oh my God.

294
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,041
How sweet.

295
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,541
- Shoot yourself.
- There we go.

296
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,791
She'll be the mother of my children.

297
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,750
Let's take a break.
The heart wants what it wants.

298
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,083
And you're all dirty here. Look.

299
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,833
If you quit, I win.

300
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,541
I'll be a minute.
I'm going to get my heart back.

301
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,541
What is this, a joke?

302
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,625
Look, it's nothing to do with me.

303
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,125
Change targets from time to time.

304
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,375
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

305
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,875
They stole it though.

306
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,916
{\an8}SORAYA THE TIGER
WOLAND CIRCUS

307
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,041
<i>En place.</i>

308
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,333
So ray a.

309
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,375
She's so good.

310
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,708
I don't know. I smell something off.

311
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,250
That'd be the camel.

312
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,208
Don't worry.

313
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,625
These people love to haggle.

314
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:33,000
But I have a plan. Trust me. I'll sort it.

315
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,083
Stroke.

316
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,000
So ray a doesn't eat meat
unless I cut it first.

317
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,791
- Your friend's called So ray a? Cute.
- Shall I cut?

318
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,000
- No.
- Go on, cut.

319
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,916
No, don't cut. No.

320
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,500
- What are you doing here?
- The kart you stole is mine.

321
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,583
- Ours.
- Stole?

322
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,166
- Yep.
- We aren't thieves.

323
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,125
Nobody meant to imply
that you're thieves. No.

324
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,166
- Then get out of here.
- All right.

325
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,208
We have enough problems as it is.

326
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,000
Who do I need to talk to?

327
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,833
Armandino might know something.

328
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,708
But I'm warning you,

329
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,791
you'll need a translator.

330
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,291
Okay.

331
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,541
This is Armandino, my cousin.

332
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,583
Not so little, is he?

333
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,375
For 50 bucks, I'll translate.

334
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:22,541
- Fifty?
- Fifty.

335
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,208
Go on.

336
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:27,958
Armandi, come talk to these guys.

337
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,166
Hello, Mr. Armandino.

338
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,208
We have nothing against
your work as a thief.

339
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,333
Nice one.

340
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,666
Since you seem like
a distinguished, sensitive person,

341
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,916
you'll understand why we want it back.

342
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,375
He says I'm really pretty,
and he wants to bang me.

343
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,875
Tell him if he wants to die,
I'll sort that right out.

344
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,208
Tell him!

345
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,291
I'll tell him.

346
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,333
Listen, my cousin is mortified.

347
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,541
Really very, very sorry.

348
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,416
Yes, he stole your kart,
but he won't give it back.

349
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,666
- I won't give it back.
- He won't.

350
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,375
- He won't give it back.
- No?

351
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,875
- No.
- But smile!

352
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,875
He'll think you're disrespectful.

353
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,625
- Well done.
- Come on.

354
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,791
Why's he smiling?

355
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,416
He says I'm cheap but worth it.

356
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,666
I think they're trying to swindle us.

357
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,875
You're disrespecting me.
You're disrespecting my cousin!

358
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,791
Nobody talks about my cousin like that!

359
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:29,083
Nobody talks about my family like that!

360
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:33,875
- He says, "The kart is mine. Only mine."
- Mine!

361
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,625
- I'll never give it back!
- Never!

362
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,916
- I'll discuss it with the gentleman.
- Sure.

363
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,041
He says, "Give me the girl,
or I'll tear you apart."

364
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,791
Joseph, Mary, pizza, rabbit!

365
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,208
Fatty fatty, phone home.

366
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,208
<i>Kara-karasho!</i>

367
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,750
Fatty fatty?

368
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:55,833
He means you.

369
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,041
It doesn't hurt.

370
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,958
This is our tradition.

371
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,875
This is how we solve problems.

372
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,125
Good, isn't it? Come on.

373
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,208
Place your bets!

374
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:31,916
Twenty-five bucks on the first to fall!

375
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,958
The bet is 25 bucks on the first to fall.

376
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,041
No. I'm warming you up.

377
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,125
Get pumped. Let's go.

378
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,208
Come on.

379
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,375
Like in the American movie <i>Over the Top!</i>

380
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Crush him!

381
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,375
No.

382
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,291
I'll whip your ass.

383
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,541
Armandino? Get up, my love.

384
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,833
Give me a hand.

385
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,875
- Good, huh?
- Good how?

386
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,708
- Ah, so that means you bet on...
- No.

387
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:57,791
- No?
- No.

388
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,666
No?

389
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,916
Freeze!

390
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,916
We need to talk business, you and I.

391
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,500
If you don't let go,

392
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,208
I swear on your old skank
of a mother I'll smash your face in.

393
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,416
My mother isn't old.

394
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,875
It sure is nice here.

395
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,291
I think I could get used to circus life.

396
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,291
No.

397
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,833
{\an8}We're gonna make a "pacto."

398
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,625
I'll help you find the kart,
and you'll do something for me.

399
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,416
- Is the spit thing necessary?
- Necessary.

400
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,125
If it's necessary...

401
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,625
It was Raniero.

402
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,958
Torsillo's son.

403
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,583
I saw him leaving the bar.

404
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,708
His father is a very powerful man.

405
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,041
He has it all, and always wants more.

406
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,208
He wanted to take your kart.

407
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,500
He wants to take our land.

408
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,666
That's why he sends the Cobras
to threaten us.

409
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,458
But you could leave.
Aren't carnies drifters?

410
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,541
- No!
- No.

411
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,583
This is our home!

412
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,458
Five generations, it's our home!

413
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:25,250
You're causing all this fuss over a kart,
and I should leave my home?

414
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,458
Firstly, calm down.

415
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,541
Secondly, it's not just any old kart.

416
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,166
It's my father's kart.

417
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,625
So you see, we want the same thing.

418
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,500
Oh yeah? We want the same thing?

419
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,875
Thanks for the information.

420
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:49,958
Hey!

421
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,250
We have a "pacto."

422
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,375
We have "pacto."

423
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,458
Torsillo sure is a megalomaniac.

424
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,291
Look who's talking!

425
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,458
What's wrong?

426
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,291
I don't like it. I'm going back.

427
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,375
Where are you going?
You'd let me go alone?

428
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,958
- You're crucial to the plan.
- What plan?

429
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,750
- Mine.
- Right, exactly, yours.

430
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:27,291
You don't know Torsillo,
and I don't trust carnies.

431
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,500
- You're scared.
- Yeah, so scared!

432
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:33,333
Know what? If you hadn't stopped
to help those guys when we were kids,

433
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,291
the buggy would still be ours!

434
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,375
What did you say?

435
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,833
I said that if you hadn't stopped
to help those guys when we were kids,

436
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,833
the kart would still be ours.

437
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

438
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,708
You're the one
who wagered it on cards, dirty cheat!

439
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:53,958
"Dirty cheat."

440
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,750
- I don't talk like that.
- "I don't..."

441
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,291
- Stop it.
- "Stop it."

442
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:59,083
I know you.

443
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:00,875
Again.

444
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,333
Know what?

445
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,291
- I don't feel like fighting.
- Fine.

446
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:06,791
Help!

447
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,875
Fine.

448
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,666
I'll go on my own!

449
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,250
But if I find the buggy, it's mine.

450
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,875
What a hovel. Morning.

451
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,125
Always this one. Trust me.

452
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,125
Gentlemen,

453
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,708
I'd like to speak to Torsillo.

454
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:54,250
I wanted to bring my brother,
but he gets wound up too easily.

455
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,333
But I told him,

456
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,625
"You'll see. There are only
good people in there."

457
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,166
So, if anyone here is the boss,

458
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,500
step forward.

459
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,041
I felt that one.

460
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,166
That one too.

461
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,333
What do you want with Mr. Torsillo?

462
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,333
You wanna offer him a deal, right?

463
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,250
Getting warmer.

464
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,958
Getting warmer.

465
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,416
Torsillo Tower.

466
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,791
Boutique, spa, heavenly beaches, clubs,

467
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,958
and all this on zero-cost land.

468
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,750
With guaranteed building permits,
colluding police

469
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,000
who are ready
to turn a blind eye to laundering.

470
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:43,333
Mr. Tanaka wants to know more
about the land transfer.

471
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,416
Mere details.

472
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,791
Some residents still haven't signed
the transfer documents,

473
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,833
but I assure you
the local administration is on my side.

474
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:52,875
Mr. Tanaka.

475
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,666
If you aren't happy, you can leave.

476
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,875
The door is there. Know what I mean?

477
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,250
Please excuse Raniero.

478
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:18,291
You'd never know it, but he's my only son.

479
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,583
What the hell?

480
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:23,250
Sorry. You said to be meaner.

481
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,958
Sure, especially with them!

482
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,791
Kids today. He's young.

483
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,916
He's a dickhead.

484
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,833
So,

485
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,791
will you tell me one last thing?

486
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,666
Yes.

487
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,375
- He doesn't like motorcyclists.
- He who?

488
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,250
These are bad for you.

489
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,833
What's going on, Scajone?

490
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:05,791
I wouldn't wake him.

491
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,333
May I?

492
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:10,958
Excuse us for interrupting your meeting,
but we need to resolve a little issue.

493
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,541
Your son stole my kart.

494
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,291
Excuse me, our kart.

495
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:20,250
A red dune buggy with a yellow soft top.

496
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,791
Yes, to be exact.

497
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,125
Please excuse me for a moment.

498
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,250
We're fine here, thanks.

499
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,166
If you give us our kart back,

500
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,791
we'll leave as if nothing happened.

501
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,083
- All right, Dad, let's give them...
- Hey!

502
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,250
Or what?

503
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:44,875
Or what?

504
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,291
I hadn't thought of it.

505
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,750
He hasn't thought of it.

506
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:56,083
Normally, I would've slit your throats.

507
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,708
But you're lucky.
I have other things to do right now.

508
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,000
Now go before I change my mind.

509
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,875
I'll give your little car back
at noon tomorrow.

510
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:09,875
Fine.

511
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,000
To my garage.

512
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,458
Oh, I forgot.

513
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:17,541
Sorry, something very important.

514
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,875
The carnies aren't leaving.

515
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,333
Goodbye. Thank you.

516
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,291
I'll leave this open.

517
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:30,666
Workers!

518
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,791
Staff these days are so unpredictable.

519
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:36,875
Translate.

520
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:38,791
There.

521
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,250
You know, you won't make it
to old age like that.

522
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,166
You won't make it to tomorrow.

523
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,750
What's the matter with you?

524
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:56,458
If it's about the carnies thing,
about me stealing that plastic...

525
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,541
Sorry I didn't tell you.

526
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,458
We were only meant to think of the car.

527
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:03,833
But if I hadn't made the pact with Miriam,
we wouldn't have found out.

528
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:04,750
- Really?
- Yeah.

529
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:07,000
You always think
you're the smartest guy around.

530
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:10,875
- But you're always first to get screwed.
- Not this again? I was 13!

531
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:13,791
If you'd really grown up,
you wouldn't make pacts with carnies.

532
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,416
First they take your finger,
then your arm, then...

533
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,333
There, exactly.

534
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,750
Brought my heart back?

535
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,333
Can I have a word?

536
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,166
You should've seen me. I kicked
the door in, knocked a couple out.

537
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,875
Then I took the model,
put it under my arm,

538
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:36,291
and said, "The carnies aren't leaving."

539
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,041
I did good, right?

540
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:39,125
Yeah.

541
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,458
Yes, but the war isn't over.

542
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:44,375
Torsillo needs to understand
this land is ours.

543
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:47,416
Yeah, I get it, but war seems
like a bit of an exaggeration.

544
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,041
I'm just interested in my kart, and...

545
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,833
I wouldn't want to complicate things.

546
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,375
- Adieu.
- What do you mean, "Adieu"?

547
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,750
Yeah, I wouldn't
want to complicate things.

548
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,708
What are you doing?

549
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:20,791
Waiting.

550
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,833
But it's midnight.

551
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,666
So go to sleep.

552
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,375
You have a long day ahead of you tomorrow.

553
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:32,791
- Me?
- Yeah.

554
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:33,875
Why?

555
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,041
Because you're leaving.

556
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,458
Breakfast?

557
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:50,208
Red dune buggy with a yellow soft top.

558
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Indeed.

559
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:03,125
- Oh yeah.
- That's it.

560
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,958
- That's it.
- That's it.

561
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,708
What did I tell you?

562
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,625
Check it out.

563
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,166
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

564
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,708
- The line.
- Yeah, really beautiful.

565
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,208
It's just that I...

566
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,458
I remembered it a bit...

567
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,416
a bit...

568
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:25,791
- Bigger.
- No.

569
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,166
- No?
- No.

570
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:29,958
Mr. Torsillo.

571
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,250
Thank you. It's perfect.

572
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,333
Thank you.

573
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:38,041
It's just that there's
a little scratch here on the hood.

574
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:41,083
A little scratch remover,
it'll be good as new.

575
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:44,375
Scajone, this time
hurt them for real. Let's go.

576
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:50,541
Scratch remover?

577
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:57,916
That's it, though.

578
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:04,250
- Oops!
- Let's go, Raniero.

579
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,291
Here we go.

580
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,083
Come on. Let's go.

581
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,500
We made complete fools of ourselves.
You dickhead!

582
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:32,250
Go on, take it!

583
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:33,916
Stop him! Run, for fuck's sake!

584
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:00,916
What a cute little doggy.

585
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,291
Come here, doggy.

586
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Don't touch Geremia!

587
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,500
Don't you dare!

588
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,625
What did that ugly brute do to you?

589
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:50,583
The bike!

590
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:14,291
<i>And so, Smiley and Stroke
became two unlikely heroes.</i>

591
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:21,708
<i>"The Cobras won't be a problem anymore,"
said Smiley.</i>

592
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:26,875
<i>Woland Circus and all the inhabitants
of Tortuga were saved.</i>

593
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:31,083
<i>Torsillo was defeated and forced to flee.</i>

594
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,291
<i>The Cobras were destroyed,</i>

595
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:39,166
<i>and they all lived happily ever after.</i>

596
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,166
<i>The end.</i>

597
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,000
<i>What ending, Scajone?</i>

598
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,583
<i>I decide when it ends.</i>

599
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Is that clear?

600
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,458
I'm sorry, boss.

601
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:52,541
You're sorry?

602
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:55,000
I screwed up, Dad. I'm sorry.

603
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,541
You're sorry?

604
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,000
Never apologize, ever!

605
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,166
Weaklings do that.

606
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,416
Dogs come crawling,
tails between their legs,

607
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,833
for shitting on the carpet!

608
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,583
Are you listening to me?
What are you thinking?

609
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,083
About dogs.

610
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,416
We could get a dog.

611
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Get a...

612
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,250
- Have you hit your head?
- What? No.

613
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,250
Are you suffering from a form
of early-onset dementia?

614
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:21,166
I just think that
if we give them back the car,

615
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,083
they'll leave us alone. Get it?

616
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,208
No!

617
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:26,333
- Why not?
- That's your car!

618
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:29,000
Use it, sell it, destroy it!
Do whatever you like!

619
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:32,416
But first, teach those two hicks
who's in charge. Got it?

620
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,625
Yeah, got it.
But why should I sell it, sorry?

621
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:39,250
Do you know how many times
I've asked if you understand me?

622
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,083
- Many.
- Many!

623
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:47,375
Go and play with your little car.
Daddy'll sort it tomorrow.

624
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,166
Dickhead.

625
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,750
Don't take it personally.
That's just how he is.

626
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:18,291
He's been treating me badly for years,

627
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,666
but it's his way of showing affection.

628
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,083
Listen, I know how to be mean.

629
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:26,583
Yes, but just remember
that there are no laws stating

630
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:29,375
that kids have to follow
in their fathers' footsteps.

631
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,833
If you haven't got it,

632
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:32,750
you haven't got it.

633
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:35,083
Let him handle those two.

634
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:45,625
- Get the Cobras and follow me.
- What you got planned?

635
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,500
I'm gonna be mean.

636
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:49,958
I'm gonna be so mean, I'll scare myself.

637
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,125
Rani. Raniero!

638
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:59,083
Just don't say any stupid shit.

639
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:16,625
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Woland Circus!

640
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:28,791
We're going to kick off the show
with our elephants!

641
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:04,958
Bravo!

642
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:10,041
Miriam!

643
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,416
Well?

644
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,833
Are you enjoying yourselves?

645
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,208
Brava!

646
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,208
- She hasn't done anything yet.
- You'll see.

647
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,291
Now,

648
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,750
Woland Circus's most dangerous act,

649
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:06,833
knife throwing.

650
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:10,666
But

651
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,791
I need a volunteer.

652
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,208
A man who's fearless,

653
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,750
brave,

654
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,916
ready to risk his life.

655
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,291
Me!

656
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:24,291
A round of applause.

657
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,333
You're good, right?

658
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:41,125
- First time.
- You're kidding?

659
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,208
No.

660
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,291
You aren't kidding?

661
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,000
I never kid.

662
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,083
If you don't kill me, I'll marry you.

663
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,291
She can't do it.

664
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Brava!

665
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:25,708
- You didn't kill me.
- I don't like you.

666
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,791
Oh no?

667
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:39,708
The kart!

668
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,666
That's it.

669
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:50,958
You wanted your kart, right?

670
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:55,041
That's it.

671
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,166
Here's your kart!

672
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:02,458
No.

673
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,541
Do something!

674
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,208
The kart!

675
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,166
What do...

676
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,583
- What do we do?
- Let's go!

677
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:36,666
- Head for the sea.
- No, I'm going to the garage.

678
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,291
- No!
- Yes, the sea will rust it.

679
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,375
I said no!

680
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:51,083
Go!

681
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,708
Here! Take this!

682
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,000
Go!

683
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,333
Get some jugs!

684
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,250
I told you, Scajone.

685
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,541
I'm scaring myself.

686
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,458
Right, boss.

687
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:40,083
Well, it could've been worse.

688
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,750
Geremia.

689
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,875
Geremia.

690
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:50,916
Geremia!

691
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,291
Geremia!

692
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,333
Sorry for leaving you alone.

693
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,541
You're burning, huh?

694
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,750
Maybe we're still in time to help Miriam.

695
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:07,958
Come on, let's go.

696
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:13,833
I'm not going anywhere.

697
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
What, sorry?

698
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,125
"What, sorry?"

699
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,125
Who helps me?

700
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,125
Nobody.

701
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,583
Know what?

702
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:27,083
I don't help anyone either,
especially you,

703
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,208
who always ruined everything as a kid
and still does now!

704
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:31,416
Look what you've done!

705
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,375
What did you expect? You'd fix everything
with a smile and a few jokes?

706
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,041
Know what?

707
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,791
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself

708
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:43,666
for always saying yes
when I should always tell you no!

709
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,083
This time, it's a no!

710
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,708
Fine. I took a gamble, and I lost.

711
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:52,500
I'm sorry. One and for all, I'm sorry!

712
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:54,708
But you were there.

713
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:57,166
I didn't hold a gun to your head.

714
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:00,000
So accept your share of responsibility.

715
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:05,375
You can keep your precious kart.
I've always hated it anyway.

716
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:11,416
And I hate you!

717
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:21,833
Cousin.

718
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,125
So ray a the tiger ran away.

719
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,375
What do we do?

720
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,541
What do we do?

721
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
We'll find her.

722
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,333
Carnie friends, the game is simple.

723
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,208
Pay attention. The joker wins.

724
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,750
- Wins.
- The aces lose.

725
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,333
- Okay.
- Okay, Armandino?

726
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:36,458
- The joker?
- Wins!

727
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,291
- The aces?
- Lose.

728
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:39,666
Lose.

729
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,833
Shall we begin?

730
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:47,500
- This one.
- This one?

731
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:49,750
Olé!

732
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,416
I win!

733
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,583
Now do it again, but slower.

734
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,916
Slow! Like a snail.

735
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,958
- Got it?
- Got it.

736
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:12,791
Okay, gents. I'll remind you.

737
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,208
- The joker...
- Wins!

738
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:17,083
- The aces.
- Lose!

739
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:34,041
- This one!
- This one?

740
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:35,791
Who wins...

741
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:39,083
- No!
- Yes, I win!

742
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,541
- Hey!
- What's wrong?

743
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,875
I can explain.

744
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,625
Son of a bunny!

745
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:57,208
I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna punch you.

746
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,291
I can explain.

747
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,291
What's up?

748
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:09,833
Pardon, madame.

749
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:24,958
Ah yes.

750
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,041
I'm not giving you 50 bucks.

751
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,791
It's not about the 50 bucks.

752
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,208
You're going the wrong way.

753
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:52,833
Torsillo's mansion is that way.

754
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,791
I'd put him down.
Unfortunately, we need him in one piece.

755
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:05,166
You were lucky today.

756
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:09,708
Thanks.

757
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:12,291
Know what? I've thought about it, and...

758
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,291
something's not quite right.

759
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,375
- Right?
- Right.

760
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,375
It needs the soft top.

761
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,666
- Yeah, because we liked it yellow.
- Yeah.

762
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,750
- We liked it yellow.
- Yellow, yeah.

763
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,500
It looks kinda...

764
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,166
smoky.

765
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,416
- Flambé.
- Flambé.

766
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,333
Shall we go and tell him?

767
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,291
- I'd say so.
- You drive, though.

768
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,000
Well, what are we waiting for?

769
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,333
<i>Karakasho!</i>

770
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:42,833
<i>- Karakasho!</i>
- Yeah!

771
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:44,041
<i>Karakasho!</i>

772
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,041
Grab the money. Come on, let's go!

773
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:53,791
<i>Karakasho.</i>

774
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,208
Thank you. Thank you all for coming.

775
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:03,125
Let's go.

776
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,333
Dear friends and business partners,

777
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:24,708
I'm delighted to see you here
on such an important day.

778
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:28,875
As you know,
the flames burned high all night.

779
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,625
But opportunity can rise from a tragedy.

780
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:35,875
Although we weep over the terrible fire

781
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:37,666
that destroyed Woland Circus,

782
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:42,541
we also rejoice
for the wonderful flow of concrete

783
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,666
which today the trucks of our...

784
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:57,375
No!

785
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:05,250
Sorry. A glitch in the program.

786
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,458
Where was I?

787
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,750
Before the interruption,
you said, "of our..."

788
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,333
I don't know what...

789
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:14,500
Although we weep over the terrible fire
that destroyed Woland Circus,

790
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:18,291
we also rejoice
for the wonderful flow of concrete...

791
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:21,291
- You've already said that.
- Of concrete. Crete!

792
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:29,833
Scajone, go check it out.

793
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:29,708
No!

794
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:55,958
You again!

795
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,708
Yeah. The kart you gave us is no good.

796
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,125
The soft top is missing. It's strange.

797
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,041
- That's true.
- See? It's not yellow.

798
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:05,291
- It's not yellow.
- We want a new one.

799
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:07,916
What will you do otherwise?

800
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:12,750
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise...

801
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,708
Otherwise we'll get mad.

802
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:22,333
Oh yeah? I'd love to see that.

803
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,083
Ouch!

804
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:49,083
Stop! Stomach, rabbit, shark, pea?

805
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,916
Charge!

806
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:15,000
Idiots. Come on, let's go!

807
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,125
Take off that damn frock!

808
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,000
Drop dead. What is this, Carnival?

809
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:30,708
I'll show them.

810
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:32,375
Torsillo!

811
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,583
It's over.

812
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,500
Really?

813
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:11,541
Oh no!

814
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:16,291
Oh no!

815
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,000
It really does work, Dad.

816
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:38,208
{\an8}<i>Ah yes, this is the real end of our story.</i>

817
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,958
<i>The circus was reconstructed,</i>

818
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:44,000
<i>the carnies had their home back,</i>

819
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:48,500
<i>and everything went back to normal
for the residents of Tortuga.</i>

820
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,375
<i>Even the red dune buggy
with a yellow soft top</i>

821
01:19:55,458 --> 01:20:00,583
<i>was returned to our heroes who, however,
had a minor outstanding issue to settle.</i>

822
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,458
How do you manage it?

823
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:03,916
It's genetic.

824
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,791
Keys on the table.

825
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,625
Hey, guys. Payment in advance, yeah?

826
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:12,708
Fair enough. Pay up.

827
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:14,833
Well...

828
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,208
Good.

829
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,458
You ready?

830
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:24,375
Ready! We're all starting the game!

831
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:27,416
Everyone for Paul Newman raise hand!

832
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,708
Three, two, one!

833
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,750
Freeze!

834
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:41,833
No.

835
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,166
You burned down my circus with that kart.

836
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:47,750
We have "pacto."

837
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:50,916
I'm playing too.

838
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,166
No. This is between me and him.

839
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:56,833
If he wins, and he won't win,

840
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,791
you two can sort it out.

841
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,208
Okay.

842
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,666
<i>Bonadei,</i> honey.

843
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,750
<i>Bonadei...</i>

844
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:12,666
Take care, <i>karasho.</i>

845
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,791
The fight's about to begin!

846
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,791
Three, two, one!

847
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,125
No!

848
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:54,583
What a woman!

849
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:28,583
<i>Ah yes. Like all great stories,
this one doesn't have an end.</i>

850
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:33,291
<i>The dune buggy will probably
never really belong to anyone.</i>

851
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,583
There, look what they've done.

852
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:33,125
Everything destroyed. Everything smashed.

853
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:37,750
Look what you've been reduced to.

854
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,250
It was a big cat.

855
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:43,916
I punched it in the head. I crushed it.

856
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,291
But it can't end like this.

857
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,625
Otherwise, what will we do?

858
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:53,583
Otherwise we'll get mad. We will.

859
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:55,541
Right!

860
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,583
Are you sure?

861
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,708
What horrible anxiety.

862
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,375
Action!

863
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:23,541
Go on.

864
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:27,208
- Oh, it won't break.
- Action!

865
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,583
Go on!

866
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,666
Hang on, I burned myself.

867
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,083
I know you.

868
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:46,791
Again!

869
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,708
You know what?

870
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:50,416
- I don't feel like fighting.
- Fine.

871
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,833
- Me? Let me try De Sica.
- Try De Sica.

872
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:58,125
- Start rolling.
- You again?

873
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,791
Yeah. The kart you gave us is no good.

874
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:06,000
- It has scratches on the side.
- Yes, and it hasn't got the soft top.

875
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,208
We want a new one.

876
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:11,500
Hang on.

877
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:13,250
What will you do otherwise?

878
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:20,333
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise...

879
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,666
We'll get mad.

880
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,250
- Cut.
- Was that a false start?

881
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:39,541
That hurt.

882
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:40,708
- Me too.
- Cut!

883
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:50,208
- Now!
- Brava!

884
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:53,125
Why did you talk? I have to say "brava."

885
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Brava!

886
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:02,416
- If he hadn't...
- And now, our most dangerous act.

887
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,500
- Knife throwing.
- Hey!

888
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:08,458
It's because he came in...

889
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,375
Otherwise, what will you do?

890
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:19,500
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise...

891
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:26,166
Are you sure?

892
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:30,833
What horrible anxiety.

893
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:36,791
Look at this guy.

894
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,666
Hang on. Let's do another take.

895
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,458
Fine. Give me a good one.

896
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,708
Three, two, one!

897
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,333
How do you mean?

898
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,833
From the top!

899
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:04,583
Action.

900
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:06,791
- Otherwise...
