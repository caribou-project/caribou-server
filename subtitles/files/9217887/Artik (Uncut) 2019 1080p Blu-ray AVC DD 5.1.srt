00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,171
(door creaks)

9
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,091
- [Woman] Right, it's feedin' time!

10
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,553
Right, come on, don't be shy!

11
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:50,598
Come on, hustle hustle, there's
starving kids in Africa.

12
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,225
There you go, come and get it.

13
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,978
The faster you eat, the
faster we get to work.

14
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,487
(dark atmospheric music)

15
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,583
We gotta get the runts out more.

16
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,586
- The search needs to
extend past just the boy.

17
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:22,631
- I know, I've heard it before.

18
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,009
- You know, I was reading that
it says here that there must

19
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,012
be a falling of hope in order
to find the justice in things.

20
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,645
(sighs) You can't have a
hero who's lost all his hope.

21
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,439
It's about the testin' and
then the rebuildin' phase.

22
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,318
You know, being rebuilt, that's justice.

23
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,281
I can't even read this.

24
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,075
It'll probably be some TV drivel soon.

25
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,793
- [Woman] Ah, I can't take this.

26
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,795
(pants)

27
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,298
- It's right where you put it.

28
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,428
- I'm tellin' you, it wasn't there before.

29
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,724
That boy's got a mind of his own.

30
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,395
- Okay, so it's not me you're fixing on.

31
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,898
Blamin' the boy like you allow him

32
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,193
next to this science experiment.

33
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,778
Best be weary of that temper of yours.

34
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,238
It's gonna get you in trouble.

35
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,620
- I know it's around the corner,

36
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,623
but them plants are gonna
need taking care of.

37
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,917
- Yeah, I got the boys out there.

38
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,086
Gotta clear out the dead roots first.

39
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,336
It'll be a good season.

40
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,213
Don't you worry.

41
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,258
- I just...

42
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,222
I don't know why we're
not fl yin' yet, you know?

43
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,725
There's, there's islands out there,

44
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:02,268
and plants and animals and
we could cash in the crop

45
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,149
and we can take the boys with us,

46
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:07,319
you can write your own
books and it'll just be

47
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,238
peaceful, all around us.

48
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,452
- You know the walk
between justice and family

49
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,412
is a thin line.

50
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,207
We're doing a good thing.

51
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,461
So, for us, we gotta keep
our heads in the game.

52
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,882
(tense atmospheric music)

53
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,180
Well...

54
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,307
Did you win?

55
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,855
Fliny always says don't
be afraid to use yourself,

56
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,856
if you ain't got the means.

57
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,358
I guess you did just that,
she'll take care of it.

58
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,742
I know you found us some
good out there, boy.

59
00:08:58,662 --> 00:08:59,621
How many miles?

60
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,211
No matter, it's our night now.

61
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,921
City targets is our territory.

62
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,926
That's a hell of a shot, boy.

63
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,690
Pack up.

64
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,703
(suspenseful music)

65
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,543
I have a feeling something drew us here.

66
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,759
Give it more punch.

67
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,055
Try it again.

00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,016
(engine churns)

69
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,601
- Hey, man.

70
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,435
Need some help?

71
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,020
- We can't figure this engine.

72
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,732
Do you know the F series?

73
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,734
- I've worked on a few, but,

74
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
this looks like a 70
and they're kinda rare.

75
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,909
- She's a hand-me-down, from my uncle.

76
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,164
He never mentioned all the problems.

77
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,249
(mechanic chuckles)

78
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,334
- Ain't that how it always goes?

79
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,629
(father chuckles)
The gift that keeps on givin'.

80
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,421
- [Father] Yes.

81
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,173
- Yeah, I guess the real gift is--

82
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,594
(thud)
(tense music)

83
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,472

84
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,350

(dark atmospheric music)

87
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,475
- Is not human.

88
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:33,107
Built from the ground up like a god.

89
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:44,119
This one here, hid behind his identity.

90
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:46,120
Behind his money.

91
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,793
Only traveled by night.

92
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:00,302
Flew through the darkness
to save an entire city.

93
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,019
It didn't work, though.

94
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,732
It never does.

95
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,403
You are weak.

96
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,247
You didn't even make it
through the first round.

97
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,000
We're gonna play a little game.

98
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,628
You're gonna pretend that
your life isn't already over.

99
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,674
You know we're not out
looking for trouble.

100
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:42,135
We just know that unless
you can be rebuilt,

101
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,595
you are not a hero.

102
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,267
It's not our call who the heroes are.

103
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,727
It's whoever can last.

104
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:56,107
And you definitely did not.

105
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:00,361
(chuckles)

106
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:07,573
I feel like I'm talkin'
to myself. (chuckles)

107
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:19,505
(fire crackles)
(crickets chirp)

108
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,509
One day, you'll be in charge here.

109
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,762
Fliny and I will be on the road somewhere.

110
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,182
The markers are getting better.

111
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,016
You're learnin'.

112
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,435
Every time, you're learnin'.

113
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,529
You're looking out for your old man.

114
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,741
There you go.

115
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:47,784
Kick it, go ahead.

116
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,952
That's right.

117
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,161
Put it out!

118
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,914
There you go, that's my boy. (chuckles)

119
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,832
Yeah, kick it!

120
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,377
Let's go, kick it, put it out, put it out!

121
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,046
There you go, kick it, go ahead!

Whoa.

135
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,208
Afraid of strangers, kid?

136

I don't blame you.

137

You know, it's like music.

141
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,479
You ever listen to music?

142
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,774
No?

00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,778
Yeah, it's all right, it

144
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,576
Look, you just gotta be
careful out here doin" this.

00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,870
All right? You've gotta
keep your hands clean.

146

get your hands dirty.

God, slow down, I got more.

152
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,026
Hey.

153
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,828
Did your parents give you a name?

154
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,706
I'm guessing they don't exist, do they?

155
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,334
But you got owners though, right?

156
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,046
Everybody's got someone who owns 'em.

157
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,174
Where your keepers at?

158
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:54,220
See, the problem is, if you're
a runaway, I'm gonna have to

159
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:57,223
take you home because those
keepers are gonna want you back.

160
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,226
Hey, what's your name, kid?

161
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,563
- They call me Boy.

162
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:07,650
Adam.

163
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:10,736
- Boy Adam.

164
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:13,865
That's your name?

165
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,911
It's what the owners call you, isn't it?

166
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,706
- I have to go home now.
- What, you got a curfew?

167
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,084
- When it's nighttime.

168
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:29,547
(dark atmospheric music)

169
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,846

170
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:39,223
Are you sure those keepers
got a place for you?

171
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,352
Hm?

172
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,939
Out here with the wolves, huh?

173
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,278
Hey, that big farm right there, that you?

174
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:55,865
All right.

175
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:01,575
Well, we stay out here much
longer, we're both gonna be

00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:06,371

get yourself back inside now.

00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,890
There you go!

181
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:23,559
Oh, damn.

182
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,771
Y'all need to get bigger ones than this!

183
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,606
These are lookin' sad.

184
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,567
(tense atmospheric music)

185
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,861
- This is it.

186
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:35,154
There ain't now escapin' what's comin'.

187
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:37,907
We got a new spot.

188
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:40,618
I'm branchin' out into the waste lines.

189
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,702
We've seen here.

190
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,333
I want you to find me somethin' there.

191
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,293
And maybe we'll find a good house guest.

192
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,219
- Questions just kept coming.

193
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,182
And there I was, in
the shadows, searching.

194
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,895
And this was everyday.

195
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:08,938
No answers.

196
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:13,567
Again, and again, and again.

197
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,779
Until one day, (clicks fingers)

198
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,447
I asked myself the right question.

199
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,077
"Is it really about what's to learn?”

200
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:26,747
I mean, there's hints sometimes, you know?

201
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,793
You ask yourself questions like,

202
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,837
"How is it possible for
them to do this to me?"

203
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,091
Or better yet, "Is the
common denominator me,

204
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:40,469
"all these times?" (chuckles)

205
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,140
Really, what you should be saying,

206
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,767
is it's not for me to understand,

207
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,310
but it is for me to accept.

208
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,736
(chuckles)

209
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,237
I don't know.

210
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,281
Maybe it's not their fault.

211
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,911
But I'll tell you one thing,
it's sure as hell not mine,

212
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,371
and it's not yours, either.

213
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,668
If you continue to search,
you will continue to fail.

214
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:16,756
All right, I'm gonna get
off my soap box. (chuckles)

215
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,590
Who's ready?

216
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,016
- My name's Holton.
- What's up, Holton?

217
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,812
- Wasn't alcohol for me.

218
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:35,149
It was the people that
used it that made me toxic.

219
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,489
I've always found myself
gravitating toward problems.

220
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,910
I think deep down inside,
whether I like it or not,

221
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,412
it's what I'm always chasing.

222
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,249
Chaos.

223
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,792
(dark atmospheric music)

224
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:57,334
And uh, I know, like you said,
it's not on me to understand,

225
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,049
it's only to accept.

226
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:07,598
Al-Anon is for those of us who
are dealing with the people

227
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,517
who have the problems and it's
funny, I think sometimes it

228
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,770
makes us think that we don't have 'em.

229
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:17,942
And I've always been straight-edge.

230
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:21,362
I've never had a drop of alcohol,
not a cigarette, nothin".

231
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,822
I've never even been curious.

232
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,494
But if all you ever knew was chaos,

233
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,161
would you ever be able to change?

234
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,875
I think, uh...

235
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,840
The way I grew up, and um...

236
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,970
And the things that I saw...

237
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,225
Things that happened to me.

238
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,021
Made me wanna go against that
grain and live a clean life,

239
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:03,279
but it also left me toxic.

240
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,740
So, um...

241
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,412
That's why I'm here, I wanna be able to

242
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,794
just trust my gut and,
and live my truth, and,

243
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:21,797
let it guide me.

244
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,883
Everyday.

245
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:31,265
- Hey, man, that was good
today, you're opening up.

246
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:34,435
- (chuckles) Yeah, I'm
just trying not to run

247
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,187
from the problem anymore, you know?

248
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,108
Plus, I figured you'd crack me eventually.

249
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:43,235
- (chuckles) Well, yeah.

250
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,239
It takes some work, but we all
come uncorked at some point.

251
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,407
- I'm with you there.

252
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,494
- It's good to see a new
face in group, by the way.

253
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,913
My name's Karl in, but you can call me Kar.

254
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,206
- Yeah, I'm Holton.

255
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,625
I've been coming here for a couple weeks.

256
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,585
- (chuckles) Sorry.

257
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:00,586
Being too formal.

258
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:04,131
(sighs) Well, I guess this
is what the party looks like

259
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,341
when you grow up straight-edge, huh?

260
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,427
- Yeah, this is pretty much
what you would find there.

261
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:11,138
Coffee and some sugar, shots of cream.

262
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,516
That's better than lettin' the bottle

263
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,143
make your choices for
you though, isn't it?

264
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:16,977
- That's true.

265
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,688
Al-Anon isn't about separation, though.

266
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,066
It's about guidance
through accepting behavior.

267
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,778
- Well, that's a tough lesson to learn.

268
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,905
But I guess time has wised us up, huh?

269
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:28,739
- Yeah.

270
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,576
Well, when you've had a breakthrough,

271
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,369
you're gonna wanna keep it consistent.

272
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,745
Come back, don't abandon it.

273
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,416
- Well you're a real straight-shooter
and I appreciate that.

274
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,877
- Hey. (chuckles)
- I'll see you next week.

275
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,503
- Sounds good, man.

276
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:46,006
(tense atmospheric music)

277
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:48,235
(moody electronic music)

278
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:01,832
(Holton chuckles)

279
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:19,349
(dark atmospheric music)

280
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,434
- It's a veggie patty.

281
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,566
My brother would skin me
alive if he heard me say that.

282
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,445
But it helps clean the
poison out, clears my head.

283
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,365
No meat.

284
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,325
No alcohol.

285
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,786
No friends.

286
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,620
No fun.

287
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,830
Nothin'.

288
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,625
I'm a clean soul now.

289
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,919
- I can't have friends.

290
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,672
That's what I was told.

291
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:53,926
- Listen.

292
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,096
Whoever owns you,

293
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,641
is creepin' too deep inside.

294
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,313
They're not lettin' the
man in here shine through.

295
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,817
Hey, look, I made somethin' I'm proud of.

296
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,026
You ever do that?

297
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,612
- No.

298
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,574
- Look.

299
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,994
So, uh, this here's a list.

300
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,954
Well, it's a book, but I make lists

301
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:24,248
and it helps me figure things out.

302
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,003
You see, anything I put
in this book comes true.

303
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,965
All you gotta do is write it down.

304
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:34,883
That's how I make things I'm proud of.

305
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:36,802
Know how to do that?

306
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,431
Well, good.

307
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,766
Your owners are doin' a
better job than I thought.

308
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:47,771
Yeah, this book, it helps me to create,

309
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,149
it helps me to craft,

310
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,861
and it's all kept in here,
it doesn't go anywhere else.

311
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,945
It's for my eyes only.

312
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,575
Any thought, any idea I ever have,

313
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,161
I let it rest in here,

314
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,122
'cause it helps to get it out.

315
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,044
'Cause when you write things
down, it takes what's in here,

316
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,003
and makes it real.

317
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,464
Does that make sense?

318
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:19,803
(tense atmospheric music)

319
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:26,977
- The boys have taken to bed,
I suggest you do the same.

320
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,813
(father chuckles)

321
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,315
- The boy's heading back soon.

322
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,192
And we've got another visitor.

323
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,655
(tense atmospheric music)
(bucket rattles)

324
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,241
- Always bringin' trash in here like that.

325
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,375
You've gotta be my
favorite little hoarder.

326
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,752
(father chuckles)

327
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:54,630
- You know, watching you flirt
is like watching a car wreck.

328
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,135
- Well, it's an early start tomorrow,

329
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,387
and I ain't got much flirtin' left.

330
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:25,870
- You drew these?

331
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,373
- Yeah.

332
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,875
- This, uh, wasn't exactly what I meant

333
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,086
when I told you to write things down.

334
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:35,587
This is somethin' else.

335
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,007
What are these drawings of?

336
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:41,176
- Things I...

337
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,220
Things I see.

338
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:47,516
(dark atmospheric music)

339
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:52,271
(knocks)

340
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,856
- Hey, Kar?
- Yeah.

341
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,190
- [Holton] Do you have a second to chat?

342
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,400
- Yeah, sure, shoot.

343
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,737
- I was just think in".

344
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:04,741
This process that we talk
about, these proceedings,

345
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,453
you think it's possible
to get someone out of it

346
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,498
while they're in it or would they have to,

347
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:13,625
to grow up with it and then
recognize the patterns?

348
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,712
- Okay, you're either asking for a friend,

349
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,048
or you're sharing outside of group.

350
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,883
- It's, uh...

351
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,638
It's a boy, he's a good kid,

352
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,016
but it seems like there's some
broken support beams at home.

353
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,353
- Is his family not around?

354
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,230
- Well, that's the thing, he
definitely has owners but it

355
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,483
seems like they're sorta leadin'
him sideways a little bit.

356
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,276
- So you think they're users.

357
00:29:39,318 --> 00:29:41,320
- Either that or there's
somethin' happened in the past.

358
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:45,032
I mean, there's a lack
of social cues in place.

359
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,493
- So, you're his lookout?

360
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,329
- Somethin' like that.

361
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,955
- It's always difficult
when children are involved.

362
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,917
Would there be an opportunity
to talk to the kid, or--

363
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,585
- Would you think that'd be the best move?

364
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,629
- It depends, is it dangerous?

365
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,381
- Oh, I don't know that yet.

366
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,466
- I see.

367
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:07,679
Well, all I can tell you is
guests are always welcome and

368
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,807
the door is always open.

369
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,518
- All right, thanks your help, Kar.

370
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,020
Appreciate it.
- Anytime, Holton.

371
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:15,812
Take care.

372
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,192
- It's easy, see?

373
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,282
That's it, so, one every

374
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:28,408
two spaces over.

375
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,205
You see, germs are a boy's best friend,

376
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:35,666
but dirt's my biggest enemy.

377
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,835
This way, them feet of yours
won't be trackin' in dirt

378
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,879
and seeds and all kinds of grime.

379
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,341
It'll finally be clean for
once when the season starts.

380
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,225
(dark atmospheric music)

381
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:54,685
- Come on, boy.

382
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,145
It ain't gonna bite you.

383
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,146
Go on and grab that.

384
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,275
There you go.

385
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,278
Take that mallet.

386
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,238
I'm gonna give you a countdown.

387
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,283
I want you to come down on it hard.

388
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,327
As hard as you can, you hear me, boy?

389
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,831
All right.

390
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,208
Three.

391
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:20,627
Two.

392
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:23,380
One.

393
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:24,840
(thud)

394
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,841
Do it again.

395
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,638
(thud)

396
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:32,055
Again!

397
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,307
(thuds)

398
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,558
Come on, boy, hit it!

399
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,601
(thud)

400
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,770
Do it again, go!
(thuds)

401
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,313
Hit it, that's a boy!
(thuds)

402
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:43,855
Yeah, hit it hard, yeah!
(thuds)

403
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:48,697
(dark atmospheric music)

404
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:50,532
Feels good, doesn't it?

405
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,789
Go get another one.

406
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,546
- He showed these to me.

407
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:09,009
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

408
00:32:10,052 --> 00:32:11,386
You think it's serious?

409
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,098
- Yeah, this is abuse and neglect.

410
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:17,601
How long did it take
him to show you these?

411
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:18,435
- Like a week?

412
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,607
- Where can I find them, the family?

413
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:25,692
- Eagle Valley, they got a farm out there.

414
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:32,074
- You gonna help me with
this big fancy dinner?

415
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,492
Y'all earned this one.

416
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:36,536
This is for gatherin' Durin' the season.

417
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,080
I'm gonna stuff you like kings.

418
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,001
Go round up the boys, go on.

419
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:57,807
(knocks)

420
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:05,815
(dark atmospheric music)

421
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,695
- Oh, hello, um, I was
wondering if I could have

422
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,155
a word with you for a minute?

423
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,535
I run a group out in Etna and

424
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,495
I just came by to extend an invitation.

425
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:21,957
- Speak.

426
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,711
- Okay, (chuckles)
you'll have to excuse me.

427
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,629
My name's Karl in, you can call me Kar.

428
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,174
- That's not a name, that's an automobile.

429
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,135
(Kar chuckles)

430
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,469
- That's true.

431
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,805
I guess my parents had a
strange sense of humor.

432
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:40,517
- You sellin' somethin'?

433
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,060
- No, no, no, no.

434
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:45,438
Your son, a friend of mine
received some drawings from him

435
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:49,981
recently and, uh, they're
pretty explicit, you know?

436
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:52,654
You know, maybe I should
just show 'em to ya.

437
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:56,700
Take a look at these.

438
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,708
I'm sorry, I'm not
explaining myself very well.

439
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,376
I'm a counselor and...

440
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,463
Honestly, I really just
came out here to tell you

441
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,507
about the group that I run and reach out.

442
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,594
You know, in situations like these,

443
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,680
not that there's any kind
of situation, I'm not

444
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:21,933
assuming there's any kind of
situation, but I felt it was

445
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,395
best after seeing these
drawings to reach out and

446
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,731
maybe even meet your son?

447
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:29,441
- What seems to be the problem?

448
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:33,195
(tense atmospheric music)
- Oh, uh, no problem at all.

449
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,697
I just happened in to be
in the neighborhood, I'm

450
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,991
spreading the word about a
meet-and-greet that I run that

451
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:42,537
helps families in need.
- Oh. (chuckles)

452
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,289
Excuse me.

453
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,502
I don't think we've been
properly acquainted.

454
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,336
I'm Arty.

455
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,340
I'd shake your hand, but
I'm covered in cooking oil,

456
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,174
and kid germs.

457
00:34:54,216 --> 00:34:56,218
- Oh, (chuckles) no problem at all.

458
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,511
I appreciate you sparing me.

459
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:01,598
- I'm sorry about Fliny, she's
a bit touchy around people

460
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,391
she hasn't dealt with before.

461
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,476
- I understand.

462
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:06,603
- These meetings are
about the neighborhood?

463
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:09,022
- No, is your son at home?

464
00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:11,900
- Yeah, yeah, the whole family's inside.

465
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:13,944
- Well, a friend of your son's

466
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,946
brought something to the forum I run.

467
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,406
- A friend of his?

468
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,782
- Yeah.

469
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:19,741
- Huh.

470
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:21,326
Yeah.

471
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:24,287
The boy is more of a
conversationalist than the other kids.

472
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,206
- I see.

473
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,667
Well, these drawings...

474
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:33,380
I just figured I would
pass them along to you?

475
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:36,758
- Uh-huh.

476
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:40,971
He's been reading a lot of comics.

477
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,224
- Oh, I see.

478
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,730
- We're fixin' to get
supper, you know, but these--

479
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,733
- Of course, I didn't mean to impose.

480
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,526
I was just in the neighborhood
and I figured I'd stop by.

481
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:58,154
- No, no, it's okay, it's
no reason to be sorry.

482
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,616
- No, no, no, thank you so
much for talking to me, I can

483
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,285
come back and I'm really sorry
for the misunderstanding.

484
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,079
- Well, if that's what
works for you, okay.

485
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,499
- Have a good night, please
apologize to your wife for me.

486
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,793
- [Arty] Fliny is a bit jumpy.

487
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:12,961
(Kar chuckles)

488
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:13,962
- Enjoy your dinner.

489
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,429
(dark atmospheric music)

490
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:28,768
- Hey!

491
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:31,854
Would you like to join us?

492
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,233
We have enough fixings to go around.

493
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,320
And you can come and look in the place.

494
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,739
Might ease your mind?

495
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,033
- Oh, um...

496
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:46,453
Yeah, no, okay, sure.

497
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,664
That'd be nice.

498
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,249
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

499
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,544
- Fliny likes to cook for a small army.

500
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:55,420
- Oh, well, I appreciate it.

501
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,505
Appreciate it a lot, it's
not everyday that you--

502
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,592
(tense string music)

503
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,406
- Goddamn it, Artik!

504
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,993
Not in here, we just
laid out the dirt floors!

505
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:27,952
How're we gonna get this clean?

506
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:35,084
Come on, come on, get
back, get back, get back!

507
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,684
(dark atmospheric music)

508
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,645
- Hi, Kar.

509
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:08,368
(Kar splutters and whines)

510
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,997
There you are.

511
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,167
(Kar splutters)

512
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:21,464
Allow me to introduce
you to my magic workshop.

513
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:24,801
This is where the research is done.

514
00:38:24,843 --> 00:38:27,887
It's kind of like a melty barn.

515
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,306
- [Kar] Please.

516
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,560
- Please?

517
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:40,062
- Please!

518
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:41,484
Please.

519
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,779
- But I'm afraid because
of the situation...

520
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:49,993
I'm going to have to get my hands dirty.

521
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:57,125
(Kar groans)

522
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,086
Who's this friend?

523
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,797
The one who knows the boy.

524
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:09,095
- You may ask yourself, is
my mind back in control now?

525
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:11,139
I think that's probably the understanding

526
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,640
of where we're all heading.

527
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:20,436
(fabric tears)
(Kar moans)

528
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,485
(suspenseful music)

529
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,738
- I like to keep my surroundings clean.

530
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:28,573
- Wait.

531
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:30,950
Wait!
(fabric tears)

532
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,327
(pants)

533
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,161
Wait!

534
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:35,246
(flesh squelches)
(screams)

535
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,332
(grunts)

536
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,877
(sobs)

537
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:45,256
- What's your connection to the boy?

538
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,383
- [Kar] Please.

539
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,634
- No more chances.

540
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,720
- [Kar] Please.

541
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,557
(sobs)

542
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,190
- [Artik] You're gonna have to
forgive me for what's coming.

543
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:03,858
- Wait, wait.

544
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:08,322
(thud)
(screams)

545
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:10,406
(whines)

546
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:19,582
(thud)
(abrasive tones)

547
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,170
(thud)
(blood splashes)

548
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:26,005
(coffee splashes)

549
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,761
- Are you the new speaker?
- Hi, Sarah.

550
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:34,555
- Holton, it's a pleasure.
- Yeah, Kar's out all week.

551
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,726
- He didn't mention being out.

552
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,896
- Actually, we were expecting
him but do you need a meeting?

553
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,565
I mean, any of us are here,
any of us could do it.

554
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,191
- No, no, thank you, I appreciate that.

555
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:47,193
I just, I needed to talk to him.

556
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:49,028
- Well, we'll be here
all week, so let me know

557
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,906
if you need anything.
- Thanks.

558
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,740
- Okay.

559
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,494
(suspenseful music)

560
00:41:50,298 --> 00:41:52,925
(fire crackles)

561
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,571
(suspenseful music)

562
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,638
(Artik howls)

563
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,352
(Atrik howls)

564
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:43,161
(dark atmospheric music)

565
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,209
(distant metal clangs)

566
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,720
(door opens and closes)

567
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:50,895
(suspenseful music)

568
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:11,290
(leaves rustle)

569
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,883
(door thuds)

570
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:14,937
- Shit.

571
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,862
Hey.

572
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:24,113
It's all right.

573
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,453
Come on.

574
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,289
Come on, let's go.

575
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:39,587
(thud)
(groans)

576
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:44,008
(dramatic percussive music)

577
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,093
(groans)

578
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,686
(bees buzz)

579
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:58,106
(dark atmospheric music)

580
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,827
(chains rattle)

581
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,911
- Right here.

582
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:17,250
(Holton grunts)

583
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,420
I take it you are a friend of the boy.

584
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,098
Figures.

585
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:37,728
I don't know what your
connection is to the boy.

586
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:41,899
But this land is mine,

587
00:47:42,942 --> 00:47:46,987
and you are marked the
second you take foot on it.

588
00:47:54,996 --> 00:47:57,623
(Holton coughs)

589
00:48:02,962 --> 00:48:04,964
- What're all those kids doing out there?

590
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,967
Why are they all locked up?

591
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:10,929
- Sometimes,

592
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:12,805
being locked up,

593
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:15,140
sets a man free.

594
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,393
- Where is Kar?

595
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,689
(muffled grunts)

596
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:26,231
- You're gonna tell me what
your connection is to the boy!

597
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,405
(Holton grunts)

598
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,200
Whatever it is you fear most...

599
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,455
It's coming for you.

600
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,875
(dark atmospheric music)

601
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,432
(Holton grunts)
(chains rattle)

602
00:48:56,474 --> 00:49:00,974
I'm writing a story about
finding something that's pure.

603
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,816
The story isn't over.

604
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,071
Purity exists in this world.

605
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,199
The problem is the drivel.

606
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,160
These heroes could not save us.

607
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,499
That's not real life now.

608
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,000
The story I'm writing?

609
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:25,795
That's real.

610
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,351
- I don't like that we're
havin' more visitors.

611
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:42,144
- He knows something about the boy.

612
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,689
- Tough shit, we gotta get rid of him.

613
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,275
- Somethin' about the
boy that we don't know.

614
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,195
He can still make mistakes.

615
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:53,989
- Okay, I'll take care of the boys,

616
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,742
and we'll take care of the harvest,

617
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:58,744
and you take out that trash
that's been stinkin' up my barn.

618
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:05,167
(tense atmospheric music)

619
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:08,504
- I don't know what's comin' to me,

620
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:12,299
but if it gives Adam a
better life, then, go ahead.

621
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,637
- I have to protect the boy,

622
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:17,971
which is why I'm going
to give him your gun.

623
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:20,141
It's something to remember you by.

624
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,476
- Words and threats, it's all I hear.

625
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,980
Real torment comes from within.

626
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,773
That's why these boys listen to you.

627
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:33,278
See, deep down, you're
the one rel yin' on them.

628
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,739
They don't need you.

629
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,199
- Really?

630
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,910
- I'm tellin' you that you
chase purity and I live it.

631
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,954
And if that's what you're after,

632
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:44,164
why don't you come and
take mine away from me?

633
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,542
Huh?

634
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:48,043
Come on!

635
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,797
(muffled grunts)

636
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,720
Let him free!

637
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,889
Let him free!

638
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,776
- Why is he takin' so long?

639
00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:18,574
- We need to try something new.

640
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:19,783
I need your help.

641
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,370
- (sighs) Damn it.

642
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,830
- [Artik] I need the alcohol.

643
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,589
- [Flin] We were savin' this for leavin'.

644
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,888
Go on, take it.

645
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,308
(dark atmospheric music)

646
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,529
(chains rattle)

647
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,115
- The normal methods aren't going to work.

648
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,952
What does a man without fear,

649
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,204
fear the most?

650
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,379
(Holton groans)

651
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,094
So, the boy says you don't even drink.

652
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:27,347
That's good because the more
of this poison that goes in ya,

653
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:30,729
the more you become the little blueprint

654
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,523
you ran away from your whole life.

655
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:40,155
You're gonna have to open your mouth, boy.

656
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:48,952
(tense atmospheric music)
(Holton splutters)

657
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:53,001
- More.

658
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,922
More!

659
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:56,755
Come on!

660
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,550
(grunts)

661
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:00,551
I want more!

662
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,595
Come on, I'm ready.

663
00:53:04,305 --> 00:53:05,097
Bring me more.

664
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,066
- Get up, boy.

665
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,236
I got something for you.

666
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:22,531
(dark atmospheric music)

667
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:37,838
There, that's more comfortable.

668
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,235
(groans)

669
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,319
There you go.

670
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,990
Not a bad view, right, boy?

671
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,410
Ah, you're thinkin' it again.

672
00:54:09,328 --> 00:54:12,080
The boy has his own free will.

673
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,961
He's coming into his manhood.

674
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:18,754
Ain't ya, boy?

675
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:20,881
Oh, I almost forgot.

676
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:22,966
This isn't for me.

677
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,971
This is for you. (chuckles)

678
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,723
I can't toast myself.

679
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,736
This one's for me.

680
00:54:51,078 --> 00:54:52,579
And this one...

681
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,626
Is for you, boy.
(suspenseful music)

682
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:58,043
- What the fuck are you doing?

683
00:54:59,378 --> 00:55:00,754
What the fuck are you doing?

684
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,340
- Someone's gotta teach the boy,

685
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,218
how to toast before having a drink.

686
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,304
- Leave him be.
(Artik chuckles)

687
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,931
- I don't see no problem

688
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:12,849
with sharing a good time with the boy.

689
00:55:18,147 --> 00:55:21,191
No, I definitely don't
see any trouble in that.

690
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,360
Top it off for you.

691
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:30,492
Now, this is what adults
have on a good day.

692
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:33,287
- Stop it!

693
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,665
- Go on, you raise it up high.

694
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:39,835
Yes.

695
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:42,922
You raise it to him.

696
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,425
And now you take a drink.

697
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,722
Go on.

698
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:52,556
- Stop.

699
00:55:55,309 --> 00:55:57,894
Adam, don't drink that.
- He has his own free will!

700
00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:05,402
(Adam splutters)

701
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:07,904
(Adam coughs)

702
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,368
- One more, now you gotta
keep it in this time.

703
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,202
- Adam.

704
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,829
- Now it's gonna have a
little bit of a kick to it,

705
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,914
but I ain't sent you wrong yet.

706
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,875
- Come on, I ain't even
puttin' up a fight.

707
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:20,876
- It ain't fighting.

708
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,755
This is how your mom and dad
play after a long day at work.

709
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,008
Someday, if you wanna grow up,

710
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,093
you're gonna have to take a sip.

711
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,137
We ain't got all day.

712
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:34,598

716
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,563
Stop it!

717
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,609
God damn it, leave him alone!

718
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,901
Stop it!

719
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:47,277

720
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,112
Drink it!

721
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,197

722
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:51,031
- Go!

723
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:55,493
(Adam gasps and coughs)

724
00:56:59,123 --> 00:56:59,998
- Hey, hey!

725
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:06,338
I'm gonna make you feel what he just felt.

726
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:09,966

727
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:18,976
- Boy?

728
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,230
Go out and prep the tarp.

729
00:57:24,231 --> 00:57:25,232
Bring the CAT around.

730
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:27,860
Get a shovel.

731
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,695
Dig a hole.

732
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,494
Go out and dig a hole, boy.

733
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:40,664
Or I'll make two.

734
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:47,295
Now!

735
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:56,096
Shit.

736
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,610
(somber atmospheric music)

737
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,285
(Adam sobs)

738
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,085
I was thinking maybe
that friend of the boy's

739
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,088
really is the one that
I've been searching for.

740
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:31,423
A true hero.

741
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:33,801
Pain don't bother him.

742
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,637
He actually moves

743
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:42,226
like he's living in some
state of constant meditation.

744
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,355
But then...

745
00:58:48,315 --> 00:58:49,357
I had an epiphany.

746
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,365
That when anger comes, so does the truth.

747
00:58:58,534 --> 00:58:59,785
That's when I realized,

748
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,707
when something happens with
the boy that upsets you...

749
00:59:08,627 --> 00:59:09,878
You're not pure inside.

750
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:19,513
(suspenseful music)

751
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,945
I left your friend out there.

752
00:59:39,366 --> 00:59:42,452
And soon, you'll be able to join him.

753
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,539
(cacophonous clangs)

754

759

- Get away from him!

760
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:56,067
Hey.

761
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,528
Hey.

762
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,821
It's okay.

763
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,573
It's okay, sweetie.

764
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,117

766
