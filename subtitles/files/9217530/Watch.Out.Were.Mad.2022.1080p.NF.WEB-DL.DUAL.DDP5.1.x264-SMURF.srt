00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:22,583
<i>Long ago, two friends took part
in an incredible race.</i>

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,458
<i>They tied and together won first prize,</i>

3
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,958
<i>a red dune buggy with a yellow soft top.</i>

4
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,041
<i>Since they didn't want to share it,</i>

5
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,291
<i>they had
a beer and sausage eating contest for it.</i>

6
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,708
<i>But then, a bad guy
who was terrorizing the neighborhood</i>

7
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,750
<i>destroyed the bar where they were eating
and set the dune buggy on fire.</i>

8
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,208
Huh!

9
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,416
<i> So the two friends got mad,</i>

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,208
<i>and after smacks and slaps,
punches and blows,</i>

11
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:55,458
<i>eventually, the bad guy bought them
two brand-new dune buggies.</i>

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,750
<i>One for each of them.
Both red with a yellow soft top.</i>

13
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:04,041
<i>But then, one of the dune buggies
caught fire, leaving only one left.</i>

14
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>And since sharing it
was completely out of the question,</i>

15
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,125
<i>our two heroes kept fighting</i>

16
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,041
<i>over the last remaining dune buggy.</i>

17
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,291
You're always so stubborn.

18
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,541
It's all your fault.

19
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,545
You know as well as I do
that's not true.

20
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,703
You crashed into me.

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,458
I crashed into you...
I was only distracted for one second.

22
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,375
- Staring at that girl.
- What girl?

23
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,541
Nobody's leaving here
until this is settled.

24
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,875
Fine.
Let's settle it with a game of cards.

25
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,083
You'll cheat.
Let's arm-wrestle instead.

26
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,446
Now you're offending me.

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,458
What,
am I too strong for you?

28
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,666
Yeah, right! You wish.

29
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,291
How about we do the usual?
Beer and sausages?

30
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,166
No, not this time.

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,583
Let's have a race.

32
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,083
A race?
You must really want to lose.

33
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:02,000
If a car
hadn't crashed into me, I would've won.

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,208
Dad, how much longer?

35
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,583
Not right now!

36
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,625
And don't you dare touch the car!

37
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,125
- You're always coming up with excuses.
- You are.

38
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,559
- No, you are.
- No.

39
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,958
Hey! Hey, come here!

40
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,333
This is a dune buggy.

41
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,416
74 cubic inch engine, 41 horsepower.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,958
It goes over 85 miles per hour.

43
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,166
Does it?

44
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,375
What are you doing? Scram!

45
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,083
- Or what, bro?
- Or else Dad will get mad.

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,041
He's already mad.

47
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,708
And besides, this buggy
doesn't even belong to us.

48
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,351
"This buggy doesn't even belong to us."

49
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,833
Don't mock me like that!

50
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,000
- "Don't mock me like that."
- Stop! I mean it.

51
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,375
"Stop! I mean it."

52
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,375
Whoa!

53
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,875
You can drive the buggy first.

54
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,875
Hey, where are you going?
Come back!

55
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,958
I told you not to touch it!

56
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,750
I'm gonna kill them.

57
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,791
I wouldn't stop.

58
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,000
- What if it were me?
- Do I have to answer?

59
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,666
Thanks, guys.

60
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,083
We ran out of gas.

61
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,875
Hey, nice car.

62
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,000
Aren't you a little too young
to be driving?

63
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,642
And aren't you ashamed that
you're driving around in that clunker?

64
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,625
Hey, my bike's name is Bolt.

65
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,833
And no one can bad-mouth Bolt.
Can I take it for a ride?

66
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:01,916
- No.
- Yeah.

67
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,416
How does this sound?

68
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,875
If you win, uh, Bolt's yours.

69
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,678
What are we supposed to do
with a two-speed?

70
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,392
- Shh. Let him finish.
- Get off me.

71
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,000
And if I win,
you let me go for a spin. Deal?

72
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,083
- No.
- It's a deal!

73
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,125
Here's the rules. The Virgin Mary wins,
St. Anthony, St. Januarius lose.

74
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,208
Example.

75
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,708
- Are you even watching?
- Shh!

76
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,791
This loses.

77
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,875
This wins.

78
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,666
Saint Anthony loses.

79
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,750
This wins.

80
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,541
This loses or wins? Forgot.

81
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,000
This wins.

82
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,083
Now pick out Mary.

83
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm afraid that you lose.

84
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,500
Yeah! Nice...

85
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,333
Dealer always wins.

86
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,458
You weren't even watching!

87
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,833
He'll be back.

88
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Any second.

89
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:42,458
MANY YEARS LATER

90
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,583
STROKE

91
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,083
Aw, good doggy.

92
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,291
Hi. Ooh, doggy.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,833
Hey, <i>karasho.</i>

94
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,166
Be happy you have a friend, huh? Cutie.

95
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,083
Come, Geremia.

96
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,541
My goodness, so grumpy.
What a bear!

97
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,666
- How much?
- It'll be fifty.

98
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,500
Fifty?

99
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,583
Mm-hmm.

100
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,875
You thief.

101
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,916
I'm the thief?

102
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,541
Here, just take it.

103
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,500
Fifty.

104
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,375
The Cobras.

105
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,708
Yo, it's the Cobras! Hey!

106
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,916
Hey, they're back!

107
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,458
- The Cobras!
- Run!

108
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,517
No, no, no.

109
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,208
Whoa!

110
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,041
WOLAND CIRCUS

111
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,208
Watch out!

112
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,416
CRAZY 4 RALLY

113
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,125
FIRST PRIZE: DUNE BUGGY

114
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,083
Where are you going?

115
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,166
Let go!

116
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,333
Mm-hmm.

117
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,500
- I appreciate a woman with fire.
- That so?

118
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,500
Mm-hmm.

119
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,500
Did you tell your boyfriend?

120
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,250
I'll give you two days to sign
and get out of here.

121
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,166
Torsillo has run out of patience!

122
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,375
Two days!

123
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,416
Two!

124
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,625
Hey.

125
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,000
You hear what I said?

126
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,458
Yo, fatso. Am I getting through, huh?

127
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,500
Bust him up, Scaglione!

128
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,583
Let me go.

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,250
Huh?

130
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,625
Now he'll clobber him.

131
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,750
Crush him!

132
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,666
Where are you going?

133
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,416
I'll get my money next time.

134
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,875
Ahh! Get off me!

135
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,541
Hey! Where are you going, coward?

136
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,490
Get your hands off me!

137
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,434
Hey, thanks.

138
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,125
You can, uh, drop me off right here!

139
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,416
- Ow!
- Thought you could cheat us?

140
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,333
Ow!

141
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,875
You're dead next time!

142
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,000
SMILEY

143
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,750
Hmm.

144
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,875
Ta-da!

145
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,083
Huh?

146
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,875
I'm doing swell. Yourself?

147
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,208
Not even a hug?

148
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,708
Get over here!

149
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,625
Okay, fine. I get it.
You don't want to talk to me.

150
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,875
You've seen this. Huh?

151
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,250
Together, we can get it back. Me and you!

152
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,166
Yeah?

153
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,791
What do you say? Hmm?

154
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,250
Ow!

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,625
What the hell?

156
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,583
That's how it's gonna be?

157
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,166
Fine, I'll win it on my own!

158
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,958
When I win, you're getting nothing.
It's gonna be all mine!

159
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,250
You'll see, I'm gonna keep it!

160
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,958
Good morning, Vietnam!

161
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,708
And welcome to the Crazy 4 Rally!

162
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,583
A cutthroat race.

163
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,791
A blaze of insanity,
gas, and testosterone.

164
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,083
How pumped up are you folks?

165
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,625
And let's not forget what brings us here.

166
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
a man who needs no introduction.

167
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,791
A man who has been blessed
with the divine gift of charisma.

168
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,666
A man so handsome

169
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,833
that when he looks in the mirror,
he kisses his own mouth!

170
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,416
What the hell is this?

171
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,708
So let's hear the heartiest applause
for Flavio Torsillo!

172
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,500
That's enough of that.

173
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,309
- Hey. Looking strong.
- Hey.

174
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,541
- Good luck to you. Best man wins.
- Hey.

175
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,333
My Lord!

176
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,333
Hey. Break a leg!

177
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,916
Huh?

178
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,125
- Yo! Yo! All right?
- Hey.

179
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,416
And if you thought this race
couldn't get any better, it just did,

180
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,041
thanks to this amazing prize,
a sensational 1974 dune buggy!

181
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,666
Who will win?

182
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,125
Who will be the most reckless driver?

183
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,375
So are we ready to get this thing started?

184
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,125
In five...

185
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,625
...and four...

186
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,500
...and three,

187
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,833
two,

188
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,458
one!

189
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,000
Go!

190
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,041
Come on, come on, come on!

191
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:34,958
Come on.

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,041
He's done for.

216
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,250
Scaglione, let's go.

217
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,291
- Hey, what about your son?
- Forget him.

218
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,166
Put your hat on. Open the door.

219
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,375
Hey! Come on! Quit it!

220
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,708
<i>Holy cow!</i>

221
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,208
<i>I don't believe it! What a twist, folks!</i>

222
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,833
Looks like the car's rolled over,
and I can't see the drivers.

223
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,583
Damn it.

224
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,500
There they are!
They're gonna finish the race by running!

225
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,500
It's the first race without cars!

226
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,750
And without any people watching!
I'm the only one left.

227
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,291
Unfair shouldering!

228
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,166
Only a few meters to go!

229
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,250
There they are, folks, on the homestretch!

230
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,208
And they've done it, folks!

231
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,625
Mine!

232
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,875
Champions! Champions!

233
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,541
Champions! Oh my!

234
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:40,375
So tell me, just how does it feel
to win a 1974 dune buggy?

235
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,291
That's it! Yes, it is!
That's the true spirit!

236
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,666
So I don't want to be the one
to ruin your excitement.

237
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,250
But I'm gonna go get the champagne.

238
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,416
Champions! Champions!

239
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,083
Whoa!

240
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,083
Well-done. Keep it going.

241
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,166
Everything was set.

242
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,625
The cars were all identical.
Mine was souped-up.

243
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,625
I have no idea how I lost.

244
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,708
What's that?

245
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,833
- That the cars were all the same.
- No, after that.

246
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,416
I just said, uh, mine was souped.

247
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
After.

248
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,000
After, um...

249
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,166
Uh, what was it, Dad?

250
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,958
Now, listen. It might have looked
like you lost the race.

251
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,541
But it's just an impression.

252
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,708
No. Look, Dad, I really lost out there.
You were there too.

253
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,916
In a race,
it's not about fairness.

254
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
Only winning matters.

255
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,916
A Torsillo never accepts defeat.

256
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,458
But that's why we always win.

257
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,666
Come. Follow me. Come.

258
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,583
Who cares if they have the car?
Just go there and take it.

259
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,000
Right.
But they're not just gonna give it to me.

260
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,583
You can't just go there and be like,

261
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,083
"Excuse me, please give me the car." Huh?

262
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,500
Mention the name Torsillo,
and they'll shit their pants.

263
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,541
After all, it's more fun to get something
when you don't deserve it!

264
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,666
"Torsillo."

265
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,250
See, Raniero, your father here
was in a similar position.

266
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,750
He wants that land. They won't let it go.

267
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,125
And believe me, I know.

268
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,833
It is theirs, after all.

269
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,541
And so what should dad say?

270
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,458
My feet, I can't feel them.

271
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,375
No, really, Alfredo. Of course,
you've been there for freaking two hours.

272
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,750
You should accept already,
before your brain freezes too, eh?

273
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,083
It's not for sale.

274
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,666
That's my home.

275
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,125
I said I want a clean job,
and so I want a clean job.

276
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,750
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,791
I'll have to throw away the meat
if he contaminates it with his bacteria.

278
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,041
- You know?
- Yes, sir.

279
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,833
Hey.

280
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,166
Sorry.

281
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,250
- The cold air.
- Why do I get this always?

282
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,666
Tell me. Close it.

283
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,375
No. No, no, no, no. No!

284
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,125
Ow!

285
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,916
Why would you do that?
I just wanna drive, you know?

286
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,375
Why?

287
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,750
Because until we settle the matter, yeah,
the buggy is staying right here.

288
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
- Oh yeah?
- Oh yeah.

289
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,958
Hey, you know if I want,
I can take it without the keys, right?

290
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,458
- I see.
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,791
All right, then.

292
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,791
Hold up. Hold up.

293
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,291
You find the joker, the buggy's yours.

294
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,125
I'm not falling for that.

295
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,833
- Piss off there, buddy.
- I could be offended by that.

296
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,750
Or what if we settled it
like we did in the past?

297
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,583
- Like in the past?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,125
I'm on a diet.

299
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,208
Uh... One second.

300
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,666
Okay, I... I get it.

301
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,875
- But what kind of diet?
- Dissociated.

302
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,875
- Ah, now I see.
- Mmm.

303
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,833
When did you last clean here?

304
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,958
This place could use the touch of a woman.

305
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,375
You got a girl now?

306
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,541
- Geremia, it's ready!
- No, I mean, besides Geremia.

307
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,125
- Okay. I'm in.
- Hmm.

308
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,559
- Like in the past, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

309
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,583
As long as you keep quiet and be still.

310
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,375
Okay. But I'll drive us.

311
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,500
Ugh, they came back again.

312
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,375
Those damn Cobras.

313
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:58,875
Ah.

314
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,833
You really changed up the place.

315
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,125
What'll it be?

316
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,041
Ah, let's see now...

317
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,875
20 pints and 20 sausages, yeah?

318
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,750
Uh, 40 sausages.

319
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,625
- Mmm.
- And a vanilla ice cream. Thank you.

320
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,708
Cleanses the palate.

321
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,041
Miriam.

322
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,791
<i>Karasho!</i>

323
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,833
Of course, they trashed everything.

324
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:10,000
They trashed the circus,
and you're here munching on hot dogs?

325
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,916
Would you look at me? Yo!

326
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,916
You're worse than the Cobras.

327
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,250
I don't wanna see you.

328
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,666
What are you looking at?

329
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,958
You must be a robber.

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,416
- How dare you!
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,125
'Cause my heart has been stolen.

332
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,416
I don't believe it. Okay?

333
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,666
- Talking romance?
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,666
- I'd sooner die.
- Okay.

335
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,250
- That's the mother of my children.
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,833
I need a break.
The heart wants what the heart wants.

337
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,208
Plus, you've got something on your... Hey!

338
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,916
Well, if you quit, then I win. Okay?

339
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,208
I'll be a minute. Gotta get my heart back.

340
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,708
I don't believe it.

341
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,375
I had nothing to do with this.

342
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,125
Hey, can't you hit another spot?

343
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,666
- Where is it?
- No clue.

344
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,666
I can imagine they stole her.

345
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,916
MIRIAM - SORAYA THE TIGER
WOLAND CIRCUS

346
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:00,791
Good girl.

347
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,375
In position.

348
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Soraya.

349
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,166
Here.

350
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,541
Good. Good.

351
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,625
Now roll.

352
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,208
She's amazing.

353
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,916
And now up.

354
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Good girl!

355
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,458
- I don't know. I smell a rat.
- Hmm?

356
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,267
The other side.

357
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:26,250
- good.
- I think it's the camel.

358
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,208
Don't worry.

359
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,625
I'm pretty sure we can barter
with these folks.

360
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,666
I have a plan. Here.
I'll sort it out for you.

361
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,583
Good girl.

362
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,083
Uh, Stroke.

363
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,166
Soraya doesn't bite her meat
unless I cut it beforehand, huh?

364
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,770
That must be a nice cat. That's great.

365
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:41,851
- Can I feed you?
- No, no.

366
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,000
Cut it already.

367
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,916
Don't. But I still need it.
No, no, no, no.

368
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,559
- Cats love the flesh.
- That buggy you stole back there is mine.

369
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,583
- No. Ours.
- Repeat that.

370
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,166
- Yeah.
- We're not stealing from you.

371
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,125
No, no, no. No one's trying to say
you're thieves. No. No.

372
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,166
- Then get out of here.
- All right.

373
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,125
We have enough problems already.

374
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,000
Who can we talk to about it?

375
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,833
Armandino might know about it.

376
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,125
But I must warn you that...

377
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,791
...you'll need a translator.

378
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,291
Okay.

379
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,125
- This is Armandino, my cousin. Hmm?
- Mmm.

380
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,333
Not so little, huh?

381
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,375
For 50 bucks, I'll translate for you.

382
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,125
- Fifty?
- Sure, fifty.

383
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,208
Okay.

384
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:25,875
Mmm.

385
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,318
Armandi, come talk to these guys.

386
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,458
So, hey, Mr. Armandino. Um...

387
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,208
In no way do we have something
against your business as a thief.

388
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,333
Thanks.

389
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,666
But since you seem to be
a distinguished and reasonable person,

390
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,916
you'll understand why we want it back.

391
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,375
Mmm.

392
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,184
He's saying I'm really nice.

393
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,375
He's asking to bang me.

394
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:51,958
Tell him
if he wants to die, I'll sort that out.

395
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,934
- Tell him! Tell him!
- I'll tell him.

396
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,358
Look, my cousin is mortified
by what's happened.

397
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,750
He very much
more than more apologizes for it.

398
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,416
I know he's stolen your buggy,
but he's not giving it back.

399
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,666
- No give it back.
- No back.

400
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,375
- Won't give it to us.
- No?

401
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,375
- No.
- But please smile!

402
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,291
You don't want him thinking
you're disrespectful. Yeah?

403
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,625
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm. Come here.

404
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,642
Why's he smiling?

405
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,333
He says I'm cheap but worth it.

406
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,296
I think
we're getting played today.

407
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,166
Mm-hmm.

408
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,934
You're disrespecting me.

409
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,875
You're disrespecting my cousin!

410
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,791
Nobody talks about my cousin like that!

411
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:29,083
Nobody talks about my family like that!

412
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,458
He's saying,
"It belongs to me."

413
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,875
- "Me and only me."
- Me. Only me.

414
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,625
- Won't give it back!
- Mine!

415
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,040
- I just need to talk for a second.
- Sure.

416
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,017
He says, "Give me
the girl, or I'll tear you apart."

417
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,142
This is going nowhere.

418
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,326
Joseph, Mary, pizza, rabbit!

419
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,750
Fatty fatty, phone home.

420
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:52,458
<i>Kara-karasho! Kara-karasho!</i>

421
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,750
Fatty fatty?

422
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,416
Sorry, that's you.

423
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,958
There is no pain.

424
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,958
And now it's the tradition.

425
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,041
This is how we settle things.

426
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,125
Man enough? Come. Come, come.

427
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,208
Place your bets!

428
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,250
The first to fall, 25 bucks!

429
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,291
25 bucks, first to fall!

430
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,958
Place your bets. 25 bucks, first to fall.

431
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,041
No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

432
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:50,958
It's... It's a warm-up.

433
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,791
Come on, get pumped. Go.

434
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,250
Like in
the American movie <i>Over the Top!</i>

435
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:24,833
Let's go!

436
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,250
No.

437
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,750
Such a cool space station.

438
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,625
Armandino?
Up, my love. Get up.

439
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:48,041
- Great, huh?
- I can't believe it.

440
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,708
- You're telling me you bet on...
- No.

441
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:57,791
- No?
- No.

442
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:03,875
No?

443
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:15,958
Ah!

444
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,916
Freeze, yeah?

445
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,916
I need to talk business with you.

446
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,506
If you don't let go,

447
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,208
I swear on your old skank
of a mother I'll smash your face in.

448
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,708
My mother's not old.

449
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,666
- It sure is nice here.
- Mmm.

450
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,791
You know,
I could get used to circus life.

451
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,958
No.

452
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,458
Why don't we make a pact?

453
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,583
You let me help you find your buggy,
you return the favor.

454
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,250
- Mmm.
- Hmm?

455
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,416
- Is the spitting thing really necessary?
- Necessary.

456
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,958
If it's necessary...

457
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,416
It was Raniero.

458
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,041
Torsillo's son.

459
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,583
I saw him with it at the bar.

460
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,708
His father's a very powerful man.

461
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,041
He has everything
but still wants more, yeah?

462
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,208
He wants to take your buggy.

463
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,666
And he wants to take our land now.

464
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,583
He paid the Cobras to threaten us.

465
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,559
Why don't you just leave then, you know?
Circus folk travel, don't they?

466
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,375
- No!
- Oh. No. Oh...

467
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,166
This is like home to us!

468
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,458
Five generations, we've lived here!

469
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,500
Man, you're sitting here
crying over a buggy

470
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,250
while this land belongs to me. Huh?

471
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,458
Hold on. Look at me.

472
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,750
It's not any old hunk of junk.

473
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:32,166
It belonged to my father.

474
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,500
Ah.

475
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,625
Looks like we're after the same thing.

476
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,500
I see. We want the same thing?

477
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,875
Thanks for the information.

478
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:49,958
Hey!

479
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,250
Never forget the pact. Okay?

480
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,333
Mm-hmm.

481
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,416
It's a pact.

482
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:09,208
- Torsillo sure is a megalomaniac.
- Look who's talking.

483
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,458
What's up?

484
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,291
Uh, maybe I should head home.

485
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,851
No, no, no. Don't leave me. Hold on.
I can't go in there alone.

486
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,958
- You're crucial to the plan.
- What plan?

487
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,750
- Mine.
- Exactly. It's yours.

488
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:27,416
You don't know Torsillo.
I don't trust circus folks.

489
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,625
- You're scared, huh?
- Yeah, so scared! Brr.

490
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:33,375
You know what? If you hadn't stopped
to help those guys when we were kids,

491
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,291
the buggy would still be ours!

492
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,375
Come again?

493
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,875
I said, if you hadn't stopped
to help those guys when we were little,

494
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,958
the buggy would still be ours.

495
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

496
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,208
Mm-hmm.

497
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,767
So who's the one who gambled it away,
you dirty little cheater!

498
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:53,958
"You dirty little cheater."

499
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,059
- I don't talk like that.
- "I don't talk like that."

500
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,291
- Stop it.
- Uh, "Stop it."

501
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,166
Uh, knew it was coming.

502
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,833
Again.

503
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,583
- You know what?
- Mm?

504
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,291
- I don't wanna fight, okay?
- Ha.

505
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,083
Okay. Okay.

506
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,708
I'll go alone. I'll go alone.

507
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,250
But if I find the buggy, it's mine.

508
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:38,166
What a shack! Hello.

509
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,708
Ah.

510
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,416
Go with this one. Trust me.

511
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,125
Folks,

512
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:50,708
I'm looking for Torsillo.

513
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:54,250
I wanted to bring my brother here,
but he's way too short-tempered.

514
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,833
I even told him,

515
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,625
"I think those are good people
in a place like that."

516
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,166
So, if anyone here
is the front man of this group,

517
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,541
step forward.

518
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,041
Could you let me go?

519
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,166
Okay, I'll stay here.

520
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,333
What do you need with Mr. Torsillo?

521
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,333
- Oh.
- You have a deal waiting for him too?

522
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,083
Very close.

523
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,958
- Huh?
- Very close.

524
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,708
The Torsillo Tower.

525
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,583
Boutiques, spas,
heavenly beaches, dancing,

526
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,500
all on land that costs virtually nothing.

527
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,750
With guaranteed building permits,
police who cooperate,

528
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,000
and willing to turn a blind eye
to money laundering.

529
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:43,333
Mr. Tanaka wants more info
on the property conveyance.

530
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,416
Minor details.

531
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,625
A couple residents
have yet to sign the documents,

532
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:50,333
but I assure you that
the local administration is on my side.

533
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:52,875
Mr. Tanaka.

534
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,083
If you don't like it, then get lost.

535
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:58,583
The door is right here.
Don't let it hit you on the way out. Okay?

536
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,416
Uh...

537
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Oh my God, please...

538
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,375
Please excuse Raniero.

539
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:15,750
I know he seems like...

540
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,416
I know it's hard to believe,
but he's my only child.

541
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,583
Are you kidding?

542
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:23,416
Sorry, Pop. I thought
you wanted me to be meaner.

543
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,083
Of course. But with this group?

544
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,791
You know kids these...
He's young, and he's...

545
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:31,916
He's a real asshole.

546
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,666
And so,

547
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,833
will you tell me one last thing?

548
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,375
Sure.

549
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,375
- I know he hates motorcyclists.
- Who?

550
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,250
These are bad.

551
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,583
Hmm?

552
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,833
What is this, Scaglione?

553
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,208
Ah, I wouldn't wake him up.

554
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,125
Excuse me.

555
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,008
Sorry if we interrupted
your meeting,

556
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,250
but we have a little problem
to figure out.

557
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,541
Your boy has stolen my buggy.

558
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,291
Ah, pardon. Our buggy.

559
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,250
A red dune buggy
that has a nice yellow soft top.

560
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,791
Yes, exactly.

561
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,708
Please excuse me one moment.

562
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,666
We're fine here, thanks.

563
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,041
See, if you give back, uh,
our special buggy...

564
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,958
...we'll just leave and pretend
that this was just a big error.

565
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,161
- Forget it, Dad, let's give them...
- Hey!

566
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,250
Or what else will you do then?

567
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,250
- Or what would we do?
- Hmm...

568
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,291
Uh... I'm not so sure yet.

569
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,791
We're not sure yet. Hmm.

570
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,083
Normally, I'd have the pleasure
of slicing your throats.

571
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,708
But you're in luck,
because right now I'm in a meeting.

572
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,291
And now... now go before I change my mind.

573
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,458
And I'll make sure
that your car is back tomorrow at noon.

574
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,291
Ah.

575
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Well...

576
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,958
I'll see you at the garage.

577
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,541
Oh, I forgot.

578
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,208
A very important thing.

579
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,125
- Mm!
- The circus people are never leaving.

580
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,333
Hmm? Mm. See you later. Appreciate it.

581
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,291
Shall I leave it open?

582
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,625
Who would really...

583
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,833
Hell of a time to find
good workers these days now.

584
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:36,916
Translate it.

585
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:38,625
Yikes.

586
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:53,958
Hey! Ah!

587
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:02,875
Ha!

588
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,875
Hmm.

589
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,250
I'm telling you,
you'll die young at this rate.

590
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,083
And you'll die tomorrow.

591
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,750
What's up with you?

592
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,875
If it's Torsillo or the circus
or that I stole the model,

593
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,916
fine! I'm sorry if I didn't tell you.

594
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,541
We were only there for the car, okay?

595
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,666
Ah, okay. See, but it's only because
of Miriam that we knew where it went.

596
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,583
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

597
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:07,083
Tell you what. You think
you're the smartest guy on Earth,

598
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,046
but you're always first one
to get screwed, man.

599
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,875
I told you I was only 13 and young!

600
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:13,083
If you'd grown up,
you'd know you shouldn't make deals

601
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,126
with circus people.
They first take your finger...

602
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,416
There you go.

603
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,250
You brought my heart with you?

604
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,333
Mind if we talk?

605
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,000
You should've seen me.

606
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,125
I kicked the door open,
knocked some of them out.

607
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,500
And then I took the model,
put it under my arm,

608
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:36,208
and said to them,
"The circus people aren't leaving."

609
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,000
- Sounds pretty good, you know?
- Yes.

610
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,458
See, but the war isn't over.

611
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:44,333
Torsillo must understand
that this land is ours.

612
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,541
So I get it, but war sounds a bit extreme.

613
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:50,041
I mean, I only want my car back.
And then we'd...

614
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,833
not complicate things with us.

615
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,500
- I'll see ya.
- Hold on, dear.

616
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,958
See? I don't want
to complicate things either.

617
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:07,875
Hmm.

618
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,791
Mmm. Mmm.

619
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,708
What's up?

620
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:20,791
I'm waiting.

621
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,541
Huh? But it's midnight.

622
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,666
Yeah. You better sleep up.

623
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,666
Tomorrow, I think you'll have a long day.

624
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:32,791
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:33,875
Why is that?

626
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,041
Because you're leaving.

627
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,125
Mmm.

628
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,458
Breakfast for ya?

629
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:50,208
A dune buggy that's red
with a yellow-colored soft top.

630
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,750
Uh-huh.

631
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:56,708
Yep.

632
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:03,125
- Oh yeah.
- That's her.

633
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,958
- It's her.
- It's her.

634
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,958
See? Told you.

635
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,708
Yeah. Look, look, look.

636
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,166
- Beauty, huh?
- Yeah.

637
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,708
- Look at the stripe.
- I'll say. Perfect beauty.

638
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,208
Eh, do you...

639
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,125
I remember it being, uh, a bit... bigger.

640
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,208
- No.
- No, huh?

641
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,291
- No.
- No, no.

642
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,083
Mr. Torsillo.

643
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,250
Thanks so much. It's perfect.

644
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,333
Thank you.

645
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:38,041
It's just that... there's
a gritty little scratch here on the top.

646
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:41,500
A bit of scratch remover
will do the trick, you know?

647
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:45,000
Scaglione, this time
I want them hurt for real. Come on.

648
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:50,541
Scratch remover?

649
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,025
It's her though.

650
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:04,250
- Oops.
- Yeah, come on, Raniero.

651
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,291
Thank you.

652
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,625
Start. Come on.

653
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,833
We made fucking fools of ourselves.
You asshole!

654
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,309
Come on, he's running!

655
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,708
- He's running!
- Come on! After him!

656
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,208
He's getting away!

657
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:01,416
Isn't this an adorable little pooch,
you know?

658
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,291
Very cute doggy.

659
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Don't touch my Geremia!

660
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,500
How do you sleep at night?

661
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,625
What did that ugly man do to you?

662
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:50,916
That's my bike!

663
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:14,291
<i>And so, Smiley and Stroke
became two unlikely heroes.</i>

664
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:22,083
<i>"The Cobras won't be a problem anymore,"
the smiley one said.</i>

665
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:26,875
<i>The Woland Circus and all the inhabitants
of Tortuga were safe.</i>

666
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,333
<i>Torsillo was defeated and forced to flee.</i>

667
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,291
<i>The Cobras were all destroyed,</i>

668
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:39,000
<i>and they all lived happily ever after.</i>

669
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,166
<i>The end.</i>

670
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,170
<i>What are you
talking about, Scaglione?</i>

671
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,500
<i>I'll decide when it ends.</i>

672
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:48,875
That clear?

673
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,458
Please let me apologize.

674
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:52,541
Apologize?

675
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:55,416
I messed up, Dad, and I'm sorry.

676
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,583
You say you're sorry?

677
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,000
Never say that you're sorry!

678
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:01,833
A deadbeat says that. A little dog
with his tail between his legs,

679
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:03,833
peeing on the carpet says sorry. Yeah?

680
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,583
Are you listening to me?
Where's your head?

681
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,333
- On dogs.
- Ah!

682
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,416
We should get a little doggy.

683
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,083
Did you, uh... get hit in the face, huh?

684
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,250
What? No.

685
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:16,666
So do you suffer
from early-onset Alzheimer's?

686
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,125
But I was just thinking, it seems like,
if we give them their buggy to them,

687
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,128
well, they should stay away
and leave us alone...

688
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,208
No!

689
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:26,333
- Why not, Dad?
- 'Cause that car is yours!

690
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:29,000
Use it, sell it, destroy it, my son,
for all I care!

691
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,458
But first, you have to show
those two hicks who's in charge.

692
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,583
Do you get it?

693
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,625
I see what you're saying,
but why would I sell it?

694
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:39,250
You know how many times
I've asked you if you get it?

695
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,083
- Tons. Many.
- Tons, son. Tons, son.

696
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,333
But go play with the buggy now, yeah?

697
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:48,041
Nobody should have it but us.

698
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:51,791
Such an asshole.

699
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,750
Don't worry. That's how he is.

700
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:20,666
I'm treated like shit all the time too,
but it's just his way he shows his love.

701
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,583
I can be mean too, just so you know.

702
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,875
Yeah, but remember
that just because he's your father,

703
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:29,375
you don't have to follow
in this footsteps and be like him.

704
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,916
If you don't have it in you,

705
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:32,541
you don't.

706
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:35,708
Let me handle those two you-know-whats.

707
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:45,625
- Bring the Cobras and follow me.
- What are you doing?

708
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,416
I'll be mean.

709
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,958
I'll be so mean
that I'll even scare myself.

710
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,708
Raniero!

711
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,666
Raniero. Raniero!

712
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,083
Make sure you don't say stupid shit.

713
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:16,625
Gentlemen and ladies,
now welcome to Circus Woland!

714
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:28,791
And we're starting our show
with the one and only elephants!

715
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:05,833
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

716
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:09,875
Miriam!

717
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,250
Not bad, huh?

718
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,333
Whoo!

719
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,625
All right now.

720
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:55,416
- Oh, stop it! I love you.
- Whoo!

721
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,208
Bravo!

722
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,208
- She hasn't done anything yet.
- Oh yeah, yeah.

723
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,291
And so,

724
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,750
a new, most perilous act at this circus,

725
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,833
the act of knife throwing.

726
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:13,416
But... I'll need one volunteer.

727
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,208
A fearless,

728
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,916
courageous man,
willing to risk his own life.

729
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:22,250
Me! Here, here, here.

730
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:26,000
An applause now.

731
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,416
You know what you're doing?

732
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:41,125
- My first time.
- You're kidding.

733
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,208
No.

734
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:44,291
You're not kidding?

735
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,625
- Scared of me?
- Uh...

736
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:50,083
So if you don't kill me,
let's marry.

737
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,916
- Hey!
- Mmm.

738
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,333
There's no way.

739
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Bravo!

740
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:25,708
- You didn't kill me.
- You're not my star.

741
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,791
I'm not?

742
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,875
The buggy! Ha!

743
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,541
Oh yeah.

744
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:52,208
- Would you like your buggy back now?
- Uh-huh.

745
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,875
It's her.

746
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,166
- Oh!
- Let's see if it ignites, huh?

747
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,916
Hey!

748
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:02,458
No.

749
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,541
Do something!

750
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,208
The buggy!

751
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,166
Let's see...

752
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,583
- Now what?
- Let's go! Let's go!

753
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:36,601
- Drive to the ocean.
- To the garage.

754
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,517
- No!
- Salt water will rust it.

755
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:39,809
No! Ow!

756
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:55,125
Here! Take!

757
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:56,208
Take!

758
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,375
Go! Go!

759
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,250
I told you, Scaglione.

760
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,541
Gonna make myself scared.

761
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,666
You even scared me.

762
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,708
Well,
could've been worse.

763
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,750
Geremia.

764
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,875
Geremia!

765
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,916
Geremia!

766
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,958
Geremia!

767
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,083
Come here.

768
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,458
I'm sorry I left you alone.

769
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,541
You're burning, huh?

770
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,750
Perhaps there's still time
to help out Miriam.

771
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:07,958
Let's go.

772
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:13,833
I'm not going anywhere.

773
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Excuse me?

774
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,041
"Excuse me?"

775
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:22,041
Who's helping me? Hmm?

776
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,125
No one.

777
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:24,541
So guess what?

778
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:27,041
I'm not helping either, especially you.

779
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,101
You've been screwing everything up
since you were five years old!

780
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,416
And now you're still doing it!

781
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,059
What do you think,
that with a smile and a few jokes,

782
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,666
you would fix everything? Hmm?

783
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,333
Well, listen.

784
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,791
You, I'm not pissed at. I'm pissed at me.

785
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,958
Because I always said yes
instead of saying no!

786
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:45,083
And now this time, it's gonna be no!

787
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,500
Okay. I took a gamble, and I lost.

788
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,916
So excuse me. Sorry.
Once and for all, I'm sorry.

789
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,708
But you were with me.

790
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,250
I didn't point a gun at your head.

791
01:02:57,916 --> 01:02:59,500
So hold yourself accountable.

792
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:05,375
You keep your precious kart.
I've always hated it.

793
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:11,583
And I hate you!

794
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:22,125
My dear cousin.

795
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,625
Soraya the tiger disappeared.

796
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,375
Now what do we do?

797
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,541
So now what?

798
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
We'll find her.

799
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,625
Circus friends,
the game is simple.

800
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:30,208
Now pay very close attention.
The joker wins.

801
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,750
- Win.
- Aces lose.

802
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,333
- Okay.
- Okay, Armandino?

803
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:36,458
- The joker?
- Wins it!

804
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,291
- Aces?
- Lose.

805
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:39,375
Very good.

806
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,833
Let's begin.

807
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:47,226
This one.

808
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,410
This one?

809
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,666
Oh... Okay!

810
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,416
Hey, I beat ya!

811
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,583
Now do it again but slower.

812
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,833
Slow! Like a snail.

813
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,416
It got?

814
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,500
I got it.

815
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:12,791
All right, folks. Remember that...

816
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,208
- The joker...
- Wins it!

817
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,250
- Aces.
- Lose!

818
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:19,875
Oh.

819
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,083
Okay.

820
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,791
This one!

821
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,708
Yeah?

822
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:35,958
Ready...

823
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,291
Hey!

824
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:39,083
Yeah! I win again!

825
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,625
- Hey!
- What's wrong?

826
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:42,500
Ah. Oh.

827
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,916
I can explain. I can ex...

828
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,208
Son of a bunny!

829
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:57,208
I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna punch you.

830
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,416
I can explain.

831
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,291
Hey.

832
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:09,833
Pardon, ma'am.

833
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:24,416
Yes.

834
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,041
I'm not giving you 50, though.

835
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,000
Shh.

836
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,791
It's not about the 50.

837
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,208
I think you're going the wrong way.

838
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:52,833
Torsillo's mansion's over there.

839
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,791
Also, I'd let him go.
Probably gonna need him.

840
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,416
Did you eat a four-leaf clover today?

841
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:09,708
Thank you.

842
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:12,291
Check it out.
I was thinking and...

843
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,291
Something's not quite right.

844
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,416
- It's not, eh?
- Nah.

845
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,375
Gotta get it soft top.

846
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,666
- All right. We always liked it yellow.
- Yeah.

847
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,416
- Hey, we liked it yellow.
- Yellow, yes.

848
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,083
'Cause now it's more... smoky?

849
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:28,416
- Smoky.
- Smoky.

850
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,333
You think we tell him?

851
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,291
- We can tell him, yeah?
- We better get moving now.

852
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:36,000
Best get it moving now.

853
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,791
<i>Karakasho!</i>

854
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,833
<i>- Karakasho!</i>
- Yeah!

855
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:45,166
<i>Karakasho!</i>

856
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:48,166
<i>Karakasho!</i>

857
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:51,041
Grab the money.
Come on, let's go car.

858
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:53,791
<i>Karakasho.</i>

859
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,291
Thank you.
Thank you all for being here.

860
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,958
Oh, thanks.

861
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:03,000
Let's go.

862
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,333
Dear friends and business partners,

863
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:24,708
I'm elated to see you here today
on such an important day.

864
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:28,875
As you know,
the flames have burned strong all night.

865
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,625
But from this tragedy
has arisen a great opportunity.

866
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:35,875
On the one hand, we weep
for the terrible fire

867
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:37,666
that destroyed Circus Woland.

868
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,500
Alas though, how amazing will it be

869
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,541
when the concrete starts to flow
from our trucks

870
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,666
on this incredible...

871
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:57,208
Yo!

872
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:04,791
Uh... Where was I? A glitch in the program.

873
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,458
What was I saying?

874
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,750
Before the interruption,
you were saying, "On this..."

875
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:11,208
But I don't know what...

876
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:12,291
So on the one hand,

877
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:15,583
we weep for the terrible fire
that destroyed the Woland Circus,

878
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:18,916
but on the other, how amazing will it be
when the concrete...

879
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,291
- You've already said...
- Concrete! Concrete!

880
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:29,833
Scaglione, go and fix it.

881
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:43,916
Mmm.

882
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,500
Mmm!

883
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,541
Ha!

884
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:30,333
No, no, no, no, no, no!

885
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:55,958
How could you do this?

886
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,708
Uh, yeah.
The buggy you gave us won't do.

887
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,166
Yep. Plus, the soft top's gone.
It looks strange.

888
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,184
- True.
- Right. It's not yellow.

889
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:05,375
- It's not yellow.
- Now we want a new one.

890
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:08,250
Or what else will you do?

891
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:09,166
Uh...

892
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,833
Uh...

893
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:12,750
- Or else we...
- Or we...

894
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,750
Or else we'll get mad, you know?

895
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,750
Oh yeah? Well, I'd love to see it.

896
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:47,583
Hold!

897
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:49,958
Belly rabbit, all of it's yellow!

898
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,583
Whoo!

899
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:44,833
Huh?

900
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,416
Bastards! Come on!

901
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:20,184
Back off with your fucking...
Piss off!

902
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,000
It's not fucking Halloween.

903
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:14,041
Ha!

904
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:16,000
Boo!

905
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,208
I'll show them.

906
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:32,541
Torsillo!

907
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,958
You're finished, yeah?

908
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,375
Oh really?

909
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:11,416
Oh no!

910
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:16,291
Oh no!

911
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,000
It really works, Father.

912
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:38,208
<i>So yeah.
This is the real end of our story.</i>

913
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,958
<i>The circus was rebuilt,</i>

914
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:44,000
<i>the circus people had their home back,</i>

915
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:48,500
<i>and for the citizens of Tortuga,
everything went back to normal.</i>

916
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,208
<i>Even the red dune buggy
with the yellow soft top</i>

917
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,916
<i>was returned to our heroes.</i>

918
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,791
<i>However, there was
one tiny unresolved issue to settle.</i>

919
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:02,458
How do you do it?

920
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:04,083
I guess it's a family thing.

921
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,333
Mm-hmm.

922
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,041
Keys on the table.

923
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:08,000
Hmm?

924
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,708
Yo, don't be cheap.
I need your money now, all right?

925
01:20:10,791 --> 01:20:12,791
I guess that's fair. Pay up.

926
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:14,958
Well...

927
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,708
- Good.
- Mmm.

928
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,458
- Hmm.
- After you.

929
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:25,166
Ready?
What the hell are you waiting for, huh?

930
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,416
Everyone start to countdown.

931
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,125
Heya, three, two, one!

932
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,791
Freeze!

933
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:41,708
Oh no.

934
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,166
Hey, my beloved circus burned
for that buggy.

935
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:47,750
We made a pact.

936
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,916
I'm playing too.

937
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,166
Oh no. This is between us, okay?

938
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:56,833
If he wins, and he won't...

939
01:20:57,416 --> 01:20:59,791
- Hmm.
- ...then you guys sort it out.

940
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,291
Oh.

941
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,716
Best of luck, hot stuff.

942
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,583
Best of luck.

943
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:12,666
Bye, <i>karasho.</i>

944
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:16,416
So, ladies and gentlemen,
we are back for more of this!

945
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,291
Let's see who wants to sit
in big boy driver seat!

946
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,708
Ready to fight? Ready to fight?

947
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:24,291
Three, a-two, a-one!

948
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:46,125
No, no, no, no!

949
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:54,583
That woman.

950
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:00,708
Huh? Huh.

951
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:15,958

There, look what they did.

980
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,791
Everything is smashed and ruined.

981
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:37,750
Look at the state you're in.

982
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,375
The cat was on me.

983
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,916
I punched it on its head and butchered it.

984
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,291
But it doesn't end here.

985
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,625
Or else what will we do?

986
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:53,583
Or else we'll get mad, you know? We will.

987
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:55,416
We will!

988
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,958
Absolutely sure, though?

989
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,916
It's so defeating.

990
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,375
Action!

991
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:23,833
Go!

992
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:27,375
- I can't break it.
- Action!

993
01:26:28,166 --> 01:26:29,375
Go!

994
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,083
Stop, I got burned.

995
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:45,541
Think I don't know you.

996
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:46,791
Again!

997
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,708
- You know what?
- Mmm?

998
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:50,416
- I'm not in the mood, okay?
- Fine.

999
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,750
Agh!

1000
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,208
Me? Let me try DP.

1001
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:58,316
- Start rolling.
- You again?

1002
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,791
Uh, yeah.
The buggy you gave us is no good.

1003
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,291
It has a few scratches on the side.

1004
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:07,000
Yes, and plus,
it doesn't have its top.

1005
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,208
We would like a new one.

1006
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,250
Wait.

1007
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:13,458
Or else what will you do?

1008
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:21,166
- Or else we'll...
- Or else we'll...

1009
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,666
...get mad.

1010
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,625
If I ever...

1011
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,375
It really hurt me.

1012
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,750
- Me too.
- And cut!

1013
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,875
<i>♪ You're back on the road... ♪</i>

1014
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,666
- Now!
- Bravo!

1015
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,458
Why did you talk before I said...

1016
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Bravo!

1017
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:00,750
So I thought...

1018
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:03,101
And now, Circus Woland's
most dangerous performance...

1019
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:06,083
- Oh, oh, my line.
- ...knife throwing.

1020
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:09,541
I can't. I can't...

1021
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:16,541
Or else what will you do?

1022
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:20,416
Or else we'll...

1023
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:26,375
Are you sure, though?

1024
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:30,833
That's so defeating.

1025
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:36,791
Look at this.

1026
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,666
Come on, let's do another one.

1027
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,458
Good. Tell me it's a good one.

1028
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,541
