1
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,420
Good evening, Mrs. Hicks.

2
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:13,290
I'm calling about invoice number
137.

3
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:17,161
There's a balance due
of $365 and 17 cents.

4
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:20,763
We sent a copy in the
envelope with your order.

5
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:22,099
Did you receive your order?

6
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,837
I do have your PO number right
here.

7
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,939
It's 137..

8
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:32,675
I'm sorry to hear that.

9
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,744
But I'm gonna have to
report to my supervisor

10
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:36,056
and let him know your intentions

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,882
in regards to this past due
invoice.

12
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:47,224
Well you have until the
13th, so enjoy your day.

13
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,060
Wait, Mrs. Hicks?

14
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,997
Can I ask you a question?

15
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,204
How long have you lived in
Denver?

16
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:03,273
Really?

17
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:06,042
Wow, that's a long time.

18
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,948
Don't you ever feel like you
just wanna...

19
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,218
leave?

20
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:30,934
Just let me do it.

21
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,171
Here you go.

22
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,293
I don't think I'll be coming
over anymore.

23
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:51,914
Oh fuck.

24
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:54,917
Do you think that maybe you can

25
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,920
just turn it back on

26
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:59,165
for tonight and I can literally

27
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:00,124
come in tomorrow morning

28
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,958
with a check for you guys or?

29
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:15,306
Okay. All right.

30
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,173
Well, thank you.

31
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:17,474
Thank you for your help.

32
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:33,656
Hey Kenny.

33
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:38,895
Audrey?

34
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,098
Hey, oh sweet.

35
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:42,875
Well I have to talk
to you about something.

36
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,033
Yeah.

37
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:45,436
Kenny's been complaining

38
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,904
about the noise and he said,
okay.

39
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,573
He says that you've been-

40
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,075
Fornicating?

41
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,142
That's it.

42
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,411
I don't think it's gonna
be a problem anymore.

43
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,445
Glad to hear it.

44
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,992
Hey mom.

45
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,295
Yeah, things are going really
great.

46
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,329
I just...

47
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,301
I've just been

48
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,070
you know, working and

49
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:55,338
you know

50
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,110
I'm not seeing anyone right now.

51
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,144
But...

52
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,297
Happy Mother's Day.

53
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,536
Hello, call me the regular way.

54
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:40,484
This is Teddy

55
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:43,754
one of our North American
Porcupines.

56
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,055
You don't do good phone work.

57
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,424
I disagree.

58
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,558
That's what it says here.

59
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:24,094
It says you better not
dealing directly with people.

60
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,096
But that's not true.

61
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,030
I'm really nice to people.

62
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,466
I'm sure you are.

63
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,367
I just don't have any-

64
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,535
What else does it say?

65
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,138
I'm terribly sorry but

66
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,076
we're gonna have to let you go.

67
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,778
Okay, cool. Got it.

68
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,681
Thank you so much. You
enjoy your day.

69
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,715
You too.

70
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,309
Audrey hey it's Warren

71
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:48,145
I'm supposed to call it hang on

72
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:49,346
Jesus I know

73
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,181
If you want someone to do
something

74
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,516
you can just say it

75
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,484
and then you can let them do it.

76
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:56,453
You don't have to keep yelling
at them.

77
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,423
Sorry, I'm sorry Audrey

78
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,592
You have to get the rent

79
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,728
it's normal to do that
and it's really late.

80
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:06,863
It's Warren, OK bye.

81
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:01,618
Okay so, I just adopted a dog

82
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:02,953
and I think it's already one

83
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:06,189
of the best decisions I've ever
made.

84
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:09,493
We had a sleep over the first
night before I adopted him.

85
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,496
And he's literally the perfect
dog.

86
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:15,932
Look at that face

87
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,634
how can you resist?

88
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:20,237
Surprisingly, there's a lot of
older dogs

89
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,539
who are in need of a
new family to love them.

90
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:24,374
Most older dogs make wonderful-

91
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:52,369
Adoptions create families.

92
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,707
And the desire for a family
is something we never lose.

93
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,309
No matter how old we are.

94
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,547
Adult adoption is on the rise

95
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,584
and it is creating families
all over the world.

96
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:12,389
If you're ready to start the
search for your forever family

97
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,927
please visit our website
at adult adoption.

98
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,539
Hi there, I've never had any
kids.

99
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,508
My wife and I are kind of lonely
here.

100
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,977
And I think it'd be helpful
for us to have someone

101
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,979
it's a funny thing, how it came
about.

102
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,057
We were thinking about going

103
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:39,983
to the humane society and
picking out an animal.

104
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:43,487
The reason why I would
like to adopt somebody is

105
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,056
because I feel it's very
possible

106
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:48,792
that many of us have been
in families in other lives.

107
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,994
And that it's possible
that we might meet one

108
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:53,530
of those family members in this
life.

109
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:56,399
But I think I could share some
joy

110
00:11:56,433 --> 00:12:00,771
with an adult who maybe has
never had these things either.

111
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,606
If you're an adult who is
looking

112
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,475
for an adoptive mother,
feel free to get in-

113
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:18,388
Hi, my name's Audrey.

114
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,024
And I'm looking to be adopted.

115
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:22,893
It was really nice watching your
video

116
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:24,795
and I hope that we get to meet.

117
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,566
Wishing you the best
over here by the river.

118
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,734
Thanks. Bye.

119
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,604
So um

120
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:38,708
I used to garden.

121
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:43,380
But I don't anymore because
of the arthritis now.

122
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:44,948
No not in five years.

123
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:49,019
I mean, we have so much in
common.

124
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,720
The music thing for starters

125
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:53,456
how many people really
like Dixieland Jazz?

126
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:57,137
I know they say they do but they
don't.

127
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,996
Actually we don't like jazz at
all.

128
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,531
We're just being polite.

129
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:14,978
Wheat toast and some water
please.

130
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:18,715
Audrey?

131
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:19,748
Ted.

132
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,857
Is Nancy coming.

133
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,992
Nancy.

134
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,393
Your wife?

135
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:31,761
Oh, she's parking the car.

136
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,599
Parking is pretty bad
around here, I guess.

137
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,035
I'm really excited about this
Audrey.

138
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:42,805
I'm excited too.

139
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:46,042
So you want a daddy?

140
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,466
Hello, my name is Sunny.

141
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,203
I've never had children,
but over the years

142
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,504
I've watched people who do

143
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:15,405
I've seen

144
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,041
so much misunderstanding in
families.

145
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:22,213
I think that if parents
can try to understand

146
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:25,882
that the things they say can
mean so much to their children

147
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,552
even little things can mean
something big.

148
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:33,623
If I was ever lucky enough to
be a parent, I'd be the kind

149
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:37,061
of parent who thinks about
what they say to their child.

150
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:38,561
And is kind.

151
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:06,957
Hi Audrey?

152
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:10,560
I'm Sunny.

153
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,928
Hi.

154
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,763
You didn't have to bring
anything.

155
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:16,733
Oh we don't have to eat it.

156
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,470
Come in. It smells good.

157
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:22,772
That's the cumin.

158
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:39,756
Have a seat.

159
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:41,024
Would you like some tea?

160
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,070
I had a boss once who told me

161
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:45,129
I should be on medication.

162
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:49,532
I think he was trying to help.

163
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:50,566
But I don't know.

164
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:52,702
Did you take his advice?

165
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,604
No, no.

166
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,706
I don't want to mess with my
brain.

167
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:09,120
Oh, do you mind if I charge my
phone?

168
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:10,987
Here, I'll do it for you.

169
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:12,021
Thanks.

170
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,529
What kind of job was it?

171
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:21,998
What?

172
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:24,101
The one with the boss
and the medication.

173
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,204
Oh God, I don't even remember

174
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,307
I've had so many jobs.

175
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:31,341
You move around?

176
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,576
I do.

177
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,644
You're a seeker.

178
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:37,614
Time for dinner?

179
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:40,884
Otto, this is Audrey.

180
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,319
Nice to meet you.

181
00:16:42,353 --> 00:16:43,653
Hmm.

182
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:44,686
Words Otto.

183
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:46,789
Hello.

184
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:52,028
What is this?

185
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:52,896
Audrey brought it.

186
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,098
Wasn't that nice?

187
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,001
I made spaghetti.

188
00:16:58,034 --> 00:16:59,236
We will have spaghetti.

189
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:01,305
Dinner will be ready soon

190
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,039
Otto why don't you tell Mutti.

191
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:04,074
Hmm.

192
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,380
Mutti is Otto's mother.

193
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:13,049
He has two children, Gretchen
and John.

194
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:16,986
Otto calls him Johan, but
everybody else calls him John.

195
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,723
Otto is very traditional.

196
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:21,757
It's nice.

197
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:26,263
Do they live nearby?

198
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:28,232
Yes, but we hardly see them.

199
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:29,699
They have their own lives.

200
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,741
Otto and I met online.

201
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,643
We both lost our spouses.

202
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:41,845
So there was nothing bad...

203
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,148
It wasn't that kind of online.

204
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,181
Right

205
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,655
I have to tell you something
Audrey.

206
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,893
Otto doesn't know why you're
here.

207
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:57,760
I'm sorry.

208
00:17:57,794 --> 00:17:58,828
I was gonna tell him but

209
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,631
I didn't know how.

210
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,836
Hi, Audrey, this is Sunny.

211
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,305
I'd love to meet you.

212
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,973
And if things work out

213
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,008
I would love for you to join our
family.

214
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:15,346
I'm sorry Otto, I should have
told you.

215
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:20,750
So your parents are still alive?

216
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:24,988
What's wrong with them?

217
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,991
Why do you need this strange
thing?

218
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,993
Is she here about the cable?

219
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,296
We don't have cable Mutti.

220
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:34,030
Television is bad enough

221
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:35,199
without the cable.

222
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:36,433
You're missing nothing.

223
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,202
The internet?

224
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,104
Endless sickening pablum.

225
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:41,738
It could be a good source for
news.

226
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:42,606
What news?

227
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,974
The world is still a stinking
mess.

228
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,477
God is still dead.

229
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,711
Some sites can be educational.

230
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:53,217
I don't know if you guys
hadn't gone to the internet

231
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,717
you wouldn't have met, right?

232
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:56,952
Hmm.

233
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:06,263
This is really delicious.

234
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:07,297
Sunny, thank you.

235
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,208
Otto's an engineer.

236
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,375
Seriously?

237
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:19,409
Yah.

238
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,045
I am retired from NASA.

239
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,880
Oh, cool.

240
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,848
What were you doing there?

241
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:30,987
Do you have a degree in
aeronautical engineering?

242
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,921
No.

243
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:34,958
So how would you
expect to understand it?

244
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,495
She's just trying to be polite
Otto.

245
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:55,246
Otto and his son have a
difficult relationship.

246
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:59,350
He does get along a little
better with his daughter though.

247
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:04,355
Johan lives his life as if
there are no other people.

248
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,358
What kind of man calls at dinner
time.

249
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,893
How old are you?

250
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:12,363
Mutti die stille!

251
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:14,465
Don't listen to her she's almost
blind.

252
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:16,567
Also she's losing her mind.

253
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,435
These symptoms are to be
expected

254
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:22,072
as an individual nears death.

255
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,111
Tell Otto where you were before.

256
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:31,382
I was working in Montana

257
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:34,851
I was at this little
resort and I was a cook.

258
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,089
How long you were there?

259
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:40,990
Well, it was a seasonal job.

260
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,394
So it's about three months.

261
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:47,097
How long have stayed in
Saugerties?

262
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,934
Pretty long like I
think it's a year now.

263
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,406
That's a long time?

264
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,439
For me it is.

265
00:20:57,374 --> 00:20:58,509
What brought you here?

266
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:02,579
I was visiting a friend.

267
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,048
What happened to the friend?

268
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:09,218
I don't know.

269
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:14,458
Audrey was raised in California.

270
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,428
The beaches.

271
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,129
The warm sand.

272
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:23,900
We lived really kind
of far from the beach

273
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,569
only went there a couple times.

274
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,443
How do you like it here Audrey?

275
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:33,876
I like it.

276
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,911
I like the river.

277
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,148
It's very deep.

278
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:41,251
This is what enabled whaling
vessels

279
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,287
to sail up from the ocean.

280
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,154
Whales?

281
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:45,656
Yah!

282
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:50,227
In 1766, the British
parliament placed a duty

283
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,895
on whale oil shipped to Britain.

284
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,933
So a group of whalers in
Nantucket

285
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:58,602
disassembled their houses

286
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:00,237
and used them to make ships

287
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,273
they then sailed them up the
Hudson River.

288
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,908
Two miles from here they
disassembled their ships

289
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:10,947
and reassembled their
houses to create a village.

290
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,616
We now know as Hudson.

291
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:15,419
So they actually dragged
the whales up the river?

292
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:16,120
No.

293
00:22:16,153 --> 00:22:18,322
First they stripped the blubber.

294
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,592
It's known as flensing.

295
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,460
The remainder of the carcass was

296
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:26,130
discarded

297
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:27,431
in the open ocean.

298
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,439
Sunny I've finished eating.

299
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:36,673
It is time to play.

300
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:40,310
What are we playing?

301
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,050
Pretty sad looking tree
house you've got there.

302
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,952
It was there when we moved in.

303
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:56,959
Sunny your hips are not aligned.

304
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:01,398
That's good now go the other
way.

305
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,467
Oh good shot.

306
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:08,672
Come on Mutti

307
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,643
You are sane approximately.

308
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,014
A sane as you are.

309
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:24,488
So

310
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,156
We will call this an experiment.

311
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:32,729
Sunny and I are taking Mutti to
Bavaria

312
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:36,400
in the fall to see our old
farm before she expires.

313
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:40,103
So we're gonna conduct
this experiment until then

314
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:43,440
and at that time we
will assess the results.

315
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:46,510
Perhaps it will continue.

316
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:49,179
Perhaps it will be conclusive,
yah.

317
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:52,683
Sounds like a plan.

318
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:57,588
Of course the farm
is now a shopping mall.

319
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:00,390
We'll take her to another place

320
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:02,392
and tell her it's the actual
farm.

321
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,298
You don't think she's gonna
notice?

322
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:22,506
Today I'm gonna walk you guys

323
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:25,175
through doing acrylic on windows

324
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,420
and that is kinda what's up
with this glow right back here

325
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,579
this is actually blue

326
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,546
and I'll show you guys pictures

327
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,615
of the whole thing afterwards

328
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,518
but just a couple tips
before we get started.

329
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:45,921
Hey.

330
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,225
Hey.

331
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,693
What's going on?

332
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:52,896
Oh just getting off work.

333
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,339
Is that biodegradable?

334
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,372
The paint?

335
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:05,542
Yeah.

336
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:06,575
Yeah, absolutely.

337
00:27:07,911 --> 00:27:09,980
Don't let any get on the
tomatoes.

338
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:11,013
Got it.

339
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:13,950
You know it's the seventh,
right?

340
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:19,956
Yeah.

341
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:24,527
I'm on it.

342
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,598
At the tone, please record your
message.

343
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:29,466
When you've finished recording

344
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:31,802
you may hang up or press one for
more.

345
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:35,772
Hey guys, it's me Audrey.

346
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:37,841
I was just calling to say hello

347
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:38,951
and hope everything's going
well.

348
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:39,976
And, um

349
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:45,449
And dad I just wanted to
check in and see how you were.

350
00:27:45,482 --> 00:27:46,917
So

351
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,418
Yeah!

352
00:27:48,452 --> 00:27:51,288
Just give me a call whenever you
can.

353
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,758
All right, things are
going really good here.

354
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:55,791
So

355
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:01,698
I'll talk to you soon. All
right, bye.

356
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:49,513
I call this MIYM chicken.

357
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:51,615
It means melt in your mouth.

358
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,316
I hope you like it.

359
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,350
It looks great.

360
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,392
It's very moist.

361
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,435
What's the matter with her?

362
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:14,637
I'm fine

363
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
I'm fine.

364
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,997
Otto would you go
see if she's all right.

365
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,600
A woman should go.

366
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,819
I think I have like a
stomach flu or something.

367
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,508
You don't have the flu.

368
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:37,121
Children sometimes unburden
themselves to their parents.

369
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,856
Yeah, so I've heard.

370
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:49,666
Still I'm objectively
interested in your difficulties.

371
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:02,445
My dad ran over my pet
chicken when I was eight.

372
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:05,548
It wasn't his fault.

373
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:06,582
It just he

374
00:31:07,984 --> 00:31:09,153
was backing out of the garage

375
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:10,587
and he just ran her over.

376
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:17,594
I've heard of this
happening to cats and dogs.

377
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:22,099
No somebody got me an incubator

378
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:27,771
and two fertilized eggs
and one just sat there.

379
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:28,772
And the other one hatched.

380
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,175
And I had her for like a year
and a half.

381
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:40,184
It was responsive to affection.

382
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:57,168
My own father was a professor.

383
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:00,637
He knew nothing about farming,

384
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,908
but in Germany after the
war, there was no food.

385
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:07,844
He was forced to learn

386
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:11,148
to raise sheep.

387
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:12,182
We were told

388
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:16,786
that we were not to
become fond of the lambs

389
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,588
because they were to eat.

390
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:19,621
So

391
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,627
We will not serve chicken
while you are here.

392
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,066
Thank you.

393
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:41,844
Emotions.

394
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,322
You have grandkids right?

395
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:54,591
Two. They are seldom here.

396
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,094
They'd really like a tree house.

397
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:00,597
Would they?

398
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,600
Yeah, they would.

399
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:09,116
Hey I'm Bobby I like to make
stuff.

400
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,575
Today we're gonna start
building a tree house.

401
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,590
This is gonna be a two part
video.

402
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:18,449
And in the first part

403
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:20,351
we're gonna build a big sturdy
platform

404
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,852
and in the second part we'll
make it look really cool.

405
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:25,316
It's hard sometimes

406
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:29,153
we must take care of our
parents.

407
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:31,955
I'll see you later Otto.

408
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:32,988
No.

409
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,760
First we must unload the lumber.

410
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:04,421
You know I can stay with
her sometimes if you want.

411
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:10,894
You may have heard

412
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:13,330
there's a smooth service
called the horizon,

413
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:15,399
out of which nothing can escape.

414
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:17,144
You may have also read
there's something called

415
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:19,336
the singularity of the
center of a black hole

416
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,971
where everything is crushed
into an infinitesimally.

417
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:24,774
Small infinitely dense point.

418
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:27,378
Even these two simple
facts are likely wrong

419
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:29,313
or at least more complicated.

420
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:30,281
But nobody knows for sure.

421
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:32,149
If only we had the cable.

422
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:36,886
Inside there
to be a ball of string.

423
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,157
There could be an incredibly
compact star.

424
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:43,726
You've done this before?

425
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Shh.

426
00:36:11,388 --> 00:36:12,922
Hey

427
00:36:12,956 --> 00:36:14,391
Hi.

428
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:16,726
Did you guys have a nice time?

429
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:21,898
Sunny give me two minutes to
prepare.

430
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:36,879
A hamburger you can
put it in the microwave.

431
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:37,913
Thanks.

432
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:40,251
Good night.

433
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,352
Good night.

434
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:09,045
Audrey its mom.

435
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,880
You call us again and again

436
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:14,084
and then when I call you
back you can't pick up?

437
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:16,253
What the fuck is wrong with you.

438
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,555
You gotta be available when we
reach out.

439
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,250
Come in.

440
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,654
Here are the tools.

441
00:38:57,688 --> 00:38:59,390
You know how to use them?

442
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,660
Yeah, I know how to use a lot
of things.

443
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:04,495
I see.

444
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,663
You're trying to induce me to
say

445
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:09,932
that a woman can't operate power
tools no?

446
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:13,002
No I just sort of expected
to be said that's all.

447
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:16,939
I imagine you do, for a
moment I considered that

448
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:20,344
then I thought she's an honest
person.

449
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:24,448
She wouldn't tell me she can
use them if she couldn't.

450
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:32,055
My son one time expressed
interest in

451
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,625
power tools.

452
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:38,429
And then we went to a hardware
store bought all of this.

453
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:42,699
You know how to use them?

454
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:43,733
No.

455
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:49,106
Sons want fathers to do these
things,

456
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,139
don't they?

457
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:54,144
I think they just want
fathers to hang out with them.

458
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:56,413
I'm not a man who hangs out.

459
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:01,752
Go on, open the next.

460
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:02,785
Okay.

461
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:10,260
Now I'm retired.

462
00:40:10,294 --> 00:40:11,728
Now I'm hanging out.

463
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,731
And in this hanging out

464
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:19,001
I discovered a curious
effect of deceleration.

465
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:21,572
There are now gaps between my
activities.

466
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:27,544
These gaps allow me to
experience regret.

467
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:30,547
For example, activity

468
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:33,350
I wasn't a father.

469
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:35,051
Activity

470
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:36,620
I was not a husband.

471
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:41,058
Activity, I was a man who worked
too much.

472
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:45,329
Activity, I was a man who grew
angry.

473
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:46,630
It's nauseating.

474
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:52,069
All right, shall we get to work?

475
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:55,772
You ever built a tree house
before?

476
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:57,773
Yeah.

477
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:35,479
So shall we say we will
complete it

478
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:39,750
by the 4th of July so the
grandchildren can enjoy it.

479
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:40,783
We?

480
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:59,563
Hi Dad I'm just um

481
00:43:00,897 --> 00:43:03,734
I'm actually building
a tree house right now.

482
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:18,215
Because he only had two worms.

483
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:19,248
Hey Kenny.

484
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:33,363
Hey, Audrey, it's Warren.

485
00:43:33,397 --> 00:43:35,499
Maybe you got my message that I
left.

486
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:37,934
You have to pay the rent.

487
00:43:37,968 --> 00:43:38,969
It's time to do that now.

488
00:43:39,002 --> 00:43:41,438
And can you just pay it?

489
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:46,443
I'll just knock again.

490
00:43:54,484 --> 00:43:57,587
I can lower the rent,
like a hundred dollars.

491
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:00,257
I can ask my mom.

492
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:04,494
Thanks Warren it's okay.

493
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:06,563
You know its time to go.

494
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:07,596
I gotta go.

495
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:10,233
For your mom?

496
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:11,267
Okay.

497
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:15,739
When am I gonna get the
deposit back?

498
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:20,477
Well we can see what's left
after I refinish the floors.

499
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,282
I'm sure it'll be fine.

500
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:27,483
Cool.

501
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:46,150
Sunny!

502
00:47:46,183 --> 00:47:48,718
Sunny the wind is predicted
to rise to twelve knots

503
00:47:48,752 --> 00:47:49,886
At three forty five.

504
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,455
So, we have to finish the pie by
two.

505
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:54,991
So, there is time to enjoy

506
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:56,459
the Fat Daddy.

507
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:10,607
He's nervous. His kids are
coming.

508
00:48:17,114 --> 00:48:18,848
How can I help?

509
00:48:18,882 --> 00:48:20,084
I can peel those if you want.

510
00:48:20,117 --> 00:48:21,651
Why don't you go help Otto.

511
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:23,585
Of course.

512
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:30,994
You need some help?

513
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:34,597
Some of these balls of
fire can be unpredictable.

514
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:39,103
You have to be prepared.

515
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:46,643
Okay. Got it.

516
00:48:48,878 --> 00:48:52,183
Sunny, she seems all right?

517
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:55,885
Yeah I think so.

518
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:00,557
Happy Fourth of July, Johan.

519
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,590
John.

520
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:07,029
He's my son.

521
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:17,141
The marinate is a little sticky.

522
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:19,276
So you might wanna grease the
grill.

523
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:29,953
So is your sister coming?

524
00:49:30,954 --> 00:49:32,589
Gretchen should be here soon.

525
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:36,593
She has to celebrate with
her ex's family first.

526
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:39,996
Sounds complicated.

527
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,831
It's a much better situation
now.

528
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:48,239
Otto loves his fireworks.

529
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:51,208
I know who calculates the
wind age prior to ignition?

530
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:53,743
The wind age?

531
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:55,011
That's the correct term.

532
00:49:57,914 --> 00:50:01,118
Johan do not under cook the
steaks.

533
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:05,722
Ay you Kraut bastard.

534
00:50:09,226 --> 00:50:11,262
How'd your parents die Audrey?

535
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:13,364
My parents aren't dead.

536
00:50:13,397 --> 00:50:15,366
Then why are we adopting you?

537
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:17,368
Guys can we leave her alone?

538
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:19,602
She has enough problems.

539
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:29,879
So what's up with the tree
house?

540
00:50:31,315 --> 00:50:32,982
Audrey's rebuilding it.

541
00:50:34,818 --> 00:50:37,821
Oh is that something you know
how to do?

542
00:50:37,854 --> 00:50:38,688
Yeah.

543
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:39,721
She's highly skilled.

544
00:50:41,058 --> 00:50:42,892
Can I go up there?

545
00:50:42,926 --> 00:50:44,261
It's too dangerous.

546
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:47,064
It'll be safe after
I finish it. I promise.

547
00:50:47,098 --> 00:50:48,375
Well, better, late than never.

548
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:50,867
We gave up trying to get Otto to
fix

549
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,304
that tree house a long time ago.

550
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:55,772
There was never time.

551
00:51:04,714 --> 00:51:08,319
We're driving down to the
Cape in Florida Monday

552
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:11,288
there will be a launch.

553
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:15,792
It's gonna be a long drive.

554
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:17,094
16 hours.

555
00:51:17,128 --> 00:51:18,128
Wow.

556
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:20,763
Will you stay at a hotel?

557
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:23,067
No lift off is at dawn.

558
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,735
We leave the morning
before, we watch the launch

559
00:51:25,768 --> 00:51:26,703
then we drive home.

560
00:51:26,736 --> 00:51:28,105
Sunny enjoys

561
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,375
the roar of the first stage
separation.

562
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:35,478
I really do.

563
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:43,354
There is blood in the steaks,
Johan.

564
00:51:43,387 --> 00:51:44,321
John.

565
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:46,956
If there is blood.
There's still bacteria.

566
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,226
Do you know we're
nothing without bacteria.

567
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,095
Otto it's all over our skin

568
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:53,028
Honey.

569
00:51:58,068 --> 00:52:00,237
Everyone give the steaks to me.

570
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:01,238
Honey, please.

571
00:52:01,272 --> 00:52:04,040
I'm going to finish
cooking them correctly.

572
00:52:04,074 --> 00:52:05,209
Give it to me

573
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:09,045
All of them, all of them.

574
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,079
Give to me.

575
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:16,353
I'm leaving.

576
00:52:16,387 --> 00:52:19,256
Go let him show you
how to make the meat.

577
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,491
Where's the thermometer?

578
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:22,025
It'll make him happy.

579
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:22,959
Doubtful.

580
00:52:22,992 --> 00:52:24,094
I have the thermometer.

581
00:52:24,128 --> 00:52:27,064
Okay. If you don't go,
we're all gonna be miserable.

582
00:52:27,097 --> 00:52:28,932
So take one for the team.

583
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:35,172
Johan you never put it near
the bone.

584
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:37,740
Bone is much more conductive
than tissue.

585
00:52:37,774 --> 00:52:39,410
It gives a false reading.

586
00:52:39,443 --> 00:52:40,520
There's no bone in these.

587
00:52:40,544 --> 00:52:41,945
Someday there will be bone.

588
00:52:41,978 --> 00:52:43,846
You'll know what to do.

589
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,418
Audrey why don't you
go to the Cape with Otto

590
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:48,952
the blast is incredible.

591
00:52:48,985 --> 00:52:49,786
Yeah he can teach you all

592
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:52,156
about aeronautics on the way
down.

593
00:52:52,189 --> 00:52:53,157
You never know.

594
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,757
You might find it interesting.

595
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,793
And if not you could pretend.

596
00:52:59,028 --> 00:53:00,130
The steaks are ready?

597
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:02,132
I think they're done.

598
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,300
They are not.

599
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:05,768
They're fucking hockey pucks.

600
00:53:05,802 --> 00:53:09,306
All right, I need to
check on the pudding.

601
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,007
Can I help you?

602
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,809
And watery diarrhea.

603
00:53:14,078 --> 00:53:15,446
Dump the scheisse.

604
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:22,818
Enjoy.

605
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,526
I want to go inside now.

606
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,245
Danke.

607
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:51,581
Remote?

608
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:28,619
Want to get something to eat?

609
00:54:28,652 --> 00:54:30,587
Something with a lot of
bacteria.

610
00:54:33,324 --> 00:54:34,391
You buying?

611
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:38,194
Wow.

612
00:54:52,242 --> 00:54:53,976
How do you like my father?

613
00:54:56,045 --> 00:54:57,181
I think Otto's great.

614
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:03,554
Has he taken you fishing yet?

615
00:55:03,587 --> 00:55:05,888
No. I didn't know he fished.

616
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:08,392
Well he doesn't, but
when he takes you fishing

617
00:55:08,425 --> 00:55:10,294
he'll set you up at the end of
the pier

618
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:11,928
and then he'll sit down

619
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:13,996
and count the number of casts
you make.

620
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:17,134
And when you've hit 26,
it'll be time for you to go.

621
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,336
Whether or not you caught a
fish.

622
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,471
Why 26?

623
00:55:20,504 --> 00:55:22,439
He did a time and motion study

624
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:24,441
and determined that if
you don't catch a fish

625
00:55:24,475 --> 00:55:26,543
after 26 casts that you never
will.

626
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:29,021
Once I figured out the system

627
00:55:29,045 --> 00:55:32,149
then I'd wait longer and
longer in between each cast

628
00:55:32,182 --> 00:55:33,517
because I wanted it to

629
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:37,052
last.

630
00:55:43,293 --> 00:55:45,995
At least he you took you
fishing.

631
00:55:46,028 --> 00:55:47,028
It's nice.

632
00:55:55,672 --> 00:55:57,050
During the summer months

633
00:55:57,074 --> 00:55:58,308
when ticks are most active.

634
00:55:58,342 --> 00:56:01,010
But first thing you can do is
wear light colored clothes.

635
00:56:01,043 --> 00:56:02,679
If you're gonna come across a
tick

636
00:56:02,713 --> 00:56:04,124
you're gonna wind up being able
to see

637
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:05,682
that tick crawling on your pants

638
00:56:05,716 --> 00:56:07,284
or crawling on your shirt.

639
00:56:07,317 --> 00:56:08,495
Even better than that would be

640
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:09,453
if you're wearing socks

641
00:56:09,486 --> 00:56:11,921
you can tuck those pants into
your socks.

642
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:25,601
Ooh.

643
00:56:29,706 --> 00:56:31,040
No, you're right.

644
00:56:34,244 --> 00:56:35,512
Cause it'd be like incest.

645
00:56:35,546 --> 00:56:36,546
Stop talking.

646
00:56:38,182 --> 00:56:41,285
We could go to one of
those states where it's legal

647
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:42,186
or at least they look the other
way.

648
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:43,654
Just stop saying words.

649
00:56:45,255 --> 00:56:46,657
You're not gonna drive, right?

650
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:47,524
No.

651
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:48,725
Good.

652
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:55,699
Good times.

653
00:56:55,732 --> 00:56:56,767
Yeah.

654
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,335
Johan.

655
00:56:58,368 --> 00:56:59,436
Oh shit.

656
00:57:00,604 --> 00:57:02,406
Johan where did you take her?

657
00:57:02,439 --> 00:57:04,274
He just took me to get some
food.

658
00:57:04,308 --> 00:57:06,477
You have been drinking.

659
00:57:17,154 --> 00:57:20,757
Why is it that immigrants
have more respect

660
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,559
for the national holiday?

661
00:57:22,593 --> 00:57:24,361
What are you talking about Otto?

662
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:26,663
You are having a
celebration and you left.

663
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:30,400
I actually really like the 4th
of July.

664
00:57:30,434 --> 00:57:34,638
I just thought you and
Sunny needed a little space.

665
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,222
We are not going to the Cape.

666
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:57,727
Otto

667
00:57:59,763 --> 00:58:01,465
his name is John.

668
00:58:01,498 --> 00:58:04,601
He prefers John. He's a nice
guy.

669
00:58:04,635 --> 00:58:06,169
What's that mean?

670
00:58:06,203 --> 00:58:09,606
Is that what a man wants
on his grave marker

671
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,074
he was a nice guy?

672
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:14,745
Better to say he was adequate.

673
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:23,287
It's not safe to drive with him.

674
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,187
John?

675
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:28,125
No in general. You must be
vigilant.

676
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,762
Also it's a holiday.

677
00:58:31,795 --> 00:58:33,130
People drink.

678
00:58:35,365 --> 00:58:37,467
They fire guns in the sky.

679
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:41,204
Otto I've been taking care
of myself for pretty long now.

680
00:58:41,238 --> 00:58:44,308
Listen to me, the world is
dangerous.

681
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:53,317
I'm talking to you as if you are
my child.

682
00:58:57,654 --> 00:58:59,656
I've forgotten.

683
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,758
How disagreeable that is.

684
00:59:53,977 --> 00:59:55,712
Hi it's Warren's phone.

685
00:59:55,746 --> 00:59:56,947
Please call me back.

686
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:02,185
I mean, I will call you back
when you leave a message here.

687
01:00:02,452 --> 01:00:03,887
Thank you. Okay, bye.

688
01:00:06,923 --> 01:00:08,659
Hey Warren, it's Audrey.

689
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,863
I really need my security
deposit back.

690
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:18,869
And if I could get it in cash,
that would be preferable.

691
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:23,206
Just call me when you can

692
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,376
or you can text me and we can
meet up.

693
01:00:27,511 --> 01:00:28,511
I hope you're well.

694
01:00:37,587 --> 01:00:39,389
If you have ever thought

695
01:00:39,423 --> 01:00:42,492
about moving to Vermont
Governor Phil Scott

696
01:00:42,526 --> 01:00:43,927
just signed a law that may make
it

697
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,429
a little more enticing

698
01:00:45,462 --> 01:00:46,863
workers who move to Vermont

699
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:48,899
and make it their home will be
eligible

700
01:00:48,932 --> 01:00:52,602
for up to $10,000 in moving
expenses and other costs.

701
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:54,404
State officials hope that the
money

702
01:00:54,438 --> 01:00:56,640
and Vermont's high
quality of life will lure

703
01:00:56,673 --> 01:00:59,810
out of state workers to
trade their office work.

704
01:01:14,558 --> 01:01:15,926
You coming up?

705
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:16,959
Yeah.

706
01:01:21,465 --> 01:01:24,434
Looks like there's much more
work to do.

707
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:26,837
No, I'm actually almost
finished.

708
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:31,975
No this section, for example
requires more support here.

709
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:33,910
It will stabilize it.

710
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:35,746
Otto I don't have any more
lumber.

711
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:36,580
You can get more.

712
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:38,615
If I did that all the way
around.

713
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:40,951
That's another like day, two
days of work.

714
01:01:40,984 --> 01:01:42,552
Oh three, I think.

715
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:45,622
And you have pride in your
labor.

716
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:50,393
All right.

717
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,817
Lithium is present only under
the salt plains of Bolivia

718
01:02:15,752 --> 01:02:17,854
some day it will run out.

719
01:02:17,888 --> 01:02:20,757
Which is why another
battery material is needed.

720
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:24,795
Manufacturers are not
willing to knowledge this.

721
01:02:51,888 --> 01:02:53,356
What the fuck?

722
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,128
Hey Audrey.

723
01:04:04,161 --> 01:04:05,161
Hi

724
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:10,634
So I brought the money.

725
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:11,501
My deposit, thank you.

726
01:04:11,534 --> 01:04:13,470
Yeah, it's in cash like you
asked.

727
01:04:13,503 --> 01:04:14,503
I needed this.

728
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:19,143
Where do you live now?

729
01:04:21,212 --> 01:04:22,212
Just

730
01:04:23,613 --> 01:04:25,015
you know, around.

731
01:04:30,687 --> 01:04:31,988
I'm fine.

732
01:04:32,022 --> 01:04:34,824
I'm on my way out of town
actually going to be leaving soon.

733
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:40,997
I'm just ready.

734
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:44,501
You ever feel like that?

735
01:04:44,534 --> 01:04:47,737
Where you're just ready
to see something else.

736
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:52,142
I mean

737
01:04:54,544 --> 01:04:55,544
volcanoes

738
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:03,586
But I live here.

739
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,620
It's my home.

740
01:05:05,622 --> 01:05:07,557
But you could live anywhere.

741
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:08,892
Your home could be anywhere.

742
01:05:11,228 --> 01:05:12,762
Not really.

743
01:05:12,796 --> 01:05:16,599
It's where you live,
where your family lives.

744
01:05:16,633 --> 01:05:17,634
Me and my mom live here.

745
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:18,667
Yeah I get it.

746
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:29,246
I would rather that you didn't
leave.

747
01:05:35,919 --> 01:05:36,920
Thank you, Warren.

748
01:05:38,155 --> 01:05:40,557
What do you have there?

749
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,692
I brought you some tomatoes,

750
01:05:42,726 --> 01:05:43,927
from my tomato garden.

751
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,961
Thanks.

752
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:46,130
Here you go.

753
01:06:16,093 --> 01:06:17,827
I did this whole thing for Otto.

754
01:06:19,063 --> 01:06:20,063
I figured that.

755
01:06:21,232 --> 01:06:22,599
I'm sorry I misled you.

756
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,800
Okay.

757
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,607
You'll be leaving soon?

758
01:06:46,756 --> 01:06:48,725
I hate rockets.

759
01:06:48,758 --> 01:06:49,993
Really?

760
01:06:50,026 --> 01:06:51,195
You can tell.

761
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:52,228
Oh yeah.

762
01:07:36,107 --> 01:07:37,107
Audrey.

763
01:07:50,254 --> 01:07:51,754
You found me.

764
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:53,224
Yeah.

765
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:55,259
Sunny, she told me you are
leaving.

766
01:07:59,963 --> 01:08:01,065
Do I smell cumin?

767
01:08:07,036 --> 01:08:08,139
You want some?

768
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:10,073
Yeah.

769
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:11,940
Good

770
01:08:15,446 --> 01:08:16,446
Sit down.

771
01:08:57,053 --> 01:08:59,989
I see that you have prior
experiences.

772
01:09:03,327 --> 01:09:05,296
The wheels come off every now
and again.

773
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:06,863
And I do this for a bit

774
01:09:06,896 --> 01:09:09,300
and then I get things back on
track.

775
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:26,217
So you will finish the
tree house before you go?

776
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,180
This is for you.

777
01:09:58,349 --> 01:10:01,285
Mutti give it to me. It
was to help me sleep.

778
01:10:01,951 --> 01:10:05,422
Shouldn't you give that
to like Gretchen or John?

779
01:10:05,456 --> 01:10:09,059
They say this is music for
Nazis.

780
01:10:11,027 --> 01:10:13,197
My parents were not Nazis.

781
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,152
This helped you sleep?

782
01:10:36,186 --> 01:10:37,288
Of course not.

783
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:40,823
Listen to it.

784
01:10:54,904 --> 01:10:55,981
One of the awesome things

785
01:10:56,005 --> 01:10:58,208
about living here in Vermont
has been just the number

786
01:10:58,242 --> 01:11:00,144
of friendships I've
been able to establish.

787
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:02,079
So today's gonna be a big day

788
01:11:02,112 --> 01:11:04,214
for doing some work on the barn.

789
01:11:11,455 --> 01:11:15,526
The term meteor in fact
refers to the streak of light

790
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:21,465
caused by a meteoroid as it
collides

791
01:11:21,498 --> 01:11:25,202
with the upper regions
of the earth atmosphere.

792
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:30,140
Most of meteoroids are only the
size

793
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,344
of a grain of sand.

794
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:34,378
Is that right?

795
01:11:35,646 --> 01:11:37,046
Space dust.

796
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:44,288
Measure twice cut once.

797
01:11:56,533 --> 01:11:57,601
We're here.

798
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:00,604
Hey.

799
01:12:00,637 --> 01:12:03,440
We're finishing up the tree
house for my grandchildren.

800
01:12:03,474 --> 01:12:05,609
I told you they can't go up
there.

801
01:12:05,642 --> 01:12:07,511
Audrey is making it safe.

802
01:12:07,544 --> 01:12:10,114
It's more than sufficient
to meet the demands

803
01:12:10,147 --> 01:12:11,224
of the County Building Code.

804
01:12:11,248 --> 01:12:13,117
Tree houses don't have
building codes.

805
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:15,885
If there was, it would
pass there's no doubt.

806
01:12:19,456 --> 01:12:21,525
Sorry can you stop that.

807
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:34,538
When you were a child, you
often asked me to fix it.

808
01:12:34,571 --> 01:12:36,140
Yes, I did.

809
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:41,545
Look at it now you can use it.

810
01:12:41,578 --> 01:12:42,546
Fuck.

811
01:12:42,579 --> 01:12:44,981
I cannot understand
when she was a child.

812
01:12:45,014 --> 01:12:47,451
She was the stable one, a fixed
particle.

813
01:12:47,484 --> 01:12:49,051
Maybe you should go talk to her.

814
01:12:49,086 --> 01:12:50,120
Is that appropriate.

815
01:12:50,154 --> 01:12:51,488
Yeah, it's appropriate.

816
01:12:51,522 --> 01:12:53,022
What do I say?

817
01:13:03,066 --> 01:13:05,102
Just go in there and listen to
her

818
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,670
and try not to teach her
anything.

819
01:13:37,634 --> 01:13:38,769
Hey Audrey?

820
01:13:38,802 --> 01:13:41,305
Fuuuuck! Fuck! Fuck!

821
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:42,339
Are you okay?

822
01:13:42,372 --> 01:13:44,208
Goddammit you little fucker.

823
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:45,542
Hey what did you just call him?

824
01:13:45,576 --> 01:13:46,577
What the fuck?

825
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,745
What is the matter with you?

826
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:50,012
Oh my God.

827
01:13:50,046 --> 01:13:51,315
Oh shit.

828
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:53,584
My finger I don't know where it
is.

829
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:57,421
Right there get in
the house in the house?

830
01:13:57,454 --> 01:13:58,522
Oh God.

831
01:14:01,558 --> 01:14:02,726
I'll get the first aid kit.

832
01:14:02,759 --> 01:14:04,394
We need the big one.

833
01:14:15,806 --> 01:14:17,674
I think it's time for me to go.

834
01:14:18,742 --> 01:14:20,210
Yeah

835
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:21,244
Yeah

836
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,350
Scheisse

837
01:14:32,289 --> 01:14:34,424
Where are you going now?

838
01:14:36,493 --> 01:14:38,262
I have some friends in Vermont

839
01:14:38,295 --> 01:14:39,295
who are

840
01:14:40,564 --> 01:14:43,500
her barn is needing some repair.

841
01:14:43,534 --> 01:14:45,435
How will you do that?

842
01:14:45,469 --> 01:14:47,104
You're missing a finger.

843
01:14:52,476 --> 01:14:54,344
Do you have insurance?

844
01:15:01,385 --> 01:15:02,486
I will pay.

845
01:15:02,519 --> 01:15:04,254
This is an emergency room Otto.

846
01:15:04,288 --> 01:15:05,798
They fix you whether you can pay
or not.

847
01:15:05,822 --> 01:15:07,157
That's how it works.

848
01:15:08,492 --> 01:15:09,793
What do we got here?

849
01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:11,061
We got a finger.

850
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:16,300
You sure do.

851
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,610
Let's see what we can do with
it.

852
01:15:17,634 --> 01:15:18,634
Good.

853
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:23,106
It's gonna be a really long
time Otto.

854
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,775
I think you should probably go
home.

855
01:15:25,909 --> 01:15:26,909
I will wait.

856
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:35,586
It's okay if you come in.

857
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:36,687
You're her dad, right?

858
01:15:45,762 --> 01:15:47,130
Just go home.

859
01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:39,596
Hey mom.

860
01:19:39,629 --> 01:19:40,629
Hi Audrey.

861
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:45,534
Come in.

862
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:57,490
Who has a shot at a million

863
01:19:57,514 --> 01:19:58,882
the rest can still win the
overall

864
01:19:58,915 --> 01:20:00,750
but they would get on the grid,

865
01:20:00,784 --> 01:20:03,053
the riders in the game, 22

866
01:20:03,087 --> 01:20:07,058
but there's only one with a
shot at a million dollars.

867
01:20:07,091 --> 01:20:11,695
And that's Eli Tommack
he has to win this race

868
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:15,599
right here to continue
that quest to a million.

869
01:20:15,632 --> 01:20:18,135
Can he do it again he did it
last year.

870
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:24,108
How about the Toyota
Whole shot it's the rider

871
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:26,676
whose been out for 16 months.

872
01:20:27,477 --> 01:20:32,649
And then just like the 64.

873
01:20:45,062 --> 01:20:46,730
How are the kids?

874
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:51,902
I don't have kids.

875
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,580
Hey Dad

876
01:21:08,152 --> 01:21:10,587
Why did you and mom get married?

877
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:16,626
She had air conditioning.

878
01:21:19,663 --> 01:21:20,797
Makes sense.

879
01:21:47,924 --> 01:21:49,693
Can I tell you something

880
01:21:52,263 --> 01:21:54,931
about me dad?

881
01:22:00,937 --> 01:22:01,938
I move around a lot.

882
01:22:03,074 --> 01:22:06,609
In the past two years, I've
lived in four different places.

883
01:22:06,643 --> 01:22:10,181
I've had like six, seven
different jobs.

884
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:15,051
I get someplace and it's great.

885
01:22:15,086 --> 01:22:19,156
Things are working out and then
they just

886
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,125
stop working out.

887
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:28,631
I think once people get to
know everything about me

888
01:22:31,568 --> 01:22:32,969
I just got to keep moving.

889
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:46,583
Why do I do that?

890
01:22:57,027 --> 01:22:58,262
I don't know.

891
01:25:49,032 --> 01:25:50,934
I was driving to the library

892
01:25:50,967 --> 01:25:54,371
to return "A Theories on Dark
Matter."

893
01:25:56,005 --> 01:25:57,141
And I saw your minivan.

894
01:25:58,975 --> 01:26:00,277
It's a distinctive car.

895
01:26:01,911 --> 01:26:02,912
Yes it is.

896
01:26:04,481 --> 01:26:05,481
May I see it.

897
01:26:08,385 --> 01:26:09,385
Yeah.

898
01:26:10,454 --> 01:26:12,056
Is there nerve damage?

899
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:14,391
I mean I can't feel a thing.

900
01:26:14,425 --> 01:26:16,427
Careful around hot objects.

901
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:19,063
It will burn before you're aware
of it.

902
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:20,096
I know Otto.

903
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,768
You didn't go to Vermont.

904
01:26:25,802 --> 01:26:26,802
No.

905
01:26:28,972 --> 01:26:30,873
No, I was already to go and
packed up.

906
01:26:30,907 --> 01:26:34,278
I came in here to get some
propane and I saw they're hiring.

907
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:37,947
So I thought I'd give the old

908
01:26:37,981 --> 01:26:41,418
staying put, a try.

909
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:42,785
See what that was like.

910
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:46,223
And what is it like?

911
01:26:47,324 --> 01:26:48,325
So far so good.

912
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,228
I like it here.

913
01:26:58,369 --> 01:26:59,536
Do you have friends?

914
01:27:01,305 --> 01:27:02,872
I'm working on it

915
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:06,076
To have friends is crucial

916
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:08,212
to regulating blood pressure.

917
01:27:14,984 --> 01:27:16,287
So?

918
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,320
Yeah.
