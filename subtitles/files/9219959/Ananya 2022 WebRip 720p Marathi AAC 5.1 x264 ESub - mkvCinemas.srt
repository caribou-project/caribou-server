00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,917
THE JOURNEY OF "ANANYA" STARTED IN
RAMNARAIN RUIA COLLEGE AS A ONE-ACT PLAY.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,167
TODAY, I FEEL EMOTIONAL WHILE
PRESENTING IT AS A MOVIE.

3
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,917
I THANK ALL MY GURUS,
FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,875
FOR HELPING ME ON THIS JOURNEY.
- PRATAP MADHAVRAO PHAD

5
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:12,250
Mr. Sarpotdar, think about it.
You can still back down.

6
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,375
Are you sure you can do it?

7
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,250
Ms. Deshmukh, I promise.

8
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,833
This ride…

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,250
will be the most memorable
ride in your life.

10
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,625
-The IV.
-Yes, sir.

11
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,833
Move, please.

12
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,542
Everyone, please move.

13
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,333
Step aside. Come on, move.

14
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,208
-Please wait outside.
-Sorry.

15
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,500
Patient's name?

16
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,375
Excuse me, sir.

17
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,542
-Yes.
-What's the patient's name?

18
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,750
Please tell me the patient's name!

19
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,750
This year, the M.Com gold medal goes to…

20
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,083
Ananya!

21
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,833
Ananya Deshmukh!

22
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,250
Congrats.

23
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:54,792
Thank you.

24
00:06:54,875 --> 00:07:00,042
-Ananya!
-Ananya!

25
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:05,333
-Ananya!
-Ananya!

26
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,458
-Ananya!
-Ananya!

27
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:08,917
We're proud of you, Ananya!

28
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,667
SAVITRIBAI PHULE PUNE UNIVERSITY
GRADUATION CEREMONY 2019-20

29
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,083
Three cheers for Ananya Deshmukh,

30
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,417
-hip, hip…
-Hooray!

31
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,417
-Hip, hip…
-Hooray!

32
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,000
-What's with all the cheering?
-Hey, come on!

33
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,792
-Don't be so modest all the time.
-Hey…

34
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,083
I mean show some excitement.
I just got a first class,

35
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,417
yet I'm more excited than you.

36
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,792
-Congratulations on that.
-Thank you.

37
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,208
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

38
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,917
Hey, Ananya, will you marry me?

39
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:43,958
What are you--

40
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,750
-Sorry.
-Sorry, dude.

41
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,667
-Better luck next time.
-Okay.

42
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,583
-Hey, shut up. What are you--
-You know you're a serial heartbreaker.

43
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,667
-That must be the 100th guy you rejected.
-Shut up.

44
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,000
You know I'll only think about
all this after I become a CA.

45
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,500
-Madam, you're great. You're impossible.
-Hey--

46
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,875
-You are--
-What rubbish! I won't spare you, wait!

47
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,458
Hey, what is this? She's been waiting
for you for so long. This is not done.

48
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,000
-Hey, don't say anything about her.
-Oh, really?

49
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,125
I agree your dad gifted you this bicycle,
but you just love it too much.

50
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,167
She might even replace me as
a bridesmaid at your wedding.

51
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,333
No, babe.

52
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:18,167
-I want both of you as my bridesmaids.
-You're impossible!

53
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,250
-Oh my God, I'm dead.
-What? What happened?

54
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,333
Ananya, I've gotta go!

55
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,042
-Would you just tell me what happened?
-"Mom has summoned me.

56
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,583
So, I'd better hurry up and flee."

57
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,000
-Wow.
-Just go, dude.

58
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,333
-Just go.
-That was great.

59
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,792
Okay, bye. I'll see you later.

60
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,125
-Yes, have a safe ride.
-You too.

61
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,667
-Please step on it. It's urgent.
-Yes, sir.

62
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,000
This veranda.

63
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,500
-What about it?
-It's in the southwest.

64
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,750
-Isn't that great?
-Not at all.

65
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:03,333
I have been avoiding
this topic for so long,

66
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,542
but not anymore.

67
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,542
Because now, I have understood
the science of architecture.

68
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,625
-Okay.
-We changed the direction of the cupboard,

69
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,958
-and boom, Ananya got a medal.
-That's right.

70
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,083
And poor Ananya thinks she got
a medal because of her studies!

71
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,042
I mean--

72
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,625
Anyway…

73
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,250
I agree with you. A hundred percent.

74
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,083
-We'll do as you say.
-Okay.

75
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,792
Close the veranda permanently.

76
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,625
Build a wall there, and then you'll see.

77
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,542
What can I see after
building a wall though!

78
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,958
Nikam, come and help me, please.

79
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,875
Please!

80
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,000
Ananya.

81
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,583
Where will you keep your new medals?
There is no space left in your cupboard.

82
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,167
Idea!

83
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,292
You can keep your medals in his cupboard.

84
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,583
I mean it's completely empty.
He hasn't won any medals, so--

85
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,125
-What did you say?
-Hey, careful! Don't pull my hair!

86
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,500
-You know what?
-What?

87
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,542
Great people believe in rewards…

88
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,542
-not medals and awards.
-Really?

89
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,833
Just watch.
One day, Mr. Dhananjay's cupboard

90
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,542
will be filled with money.

91
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:20,250
No, listen.

92
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,333
-Your friend here is a scholar, right?
-Yes, she is.

93
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:27,500
Then tell her to clear the CA
final exams on the first attempt.

94
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,375
She will. What will you do in return?

95
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,875
I'll sing her praises in public.

96
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,000
-Done. Ananya, challenge accepted, okay?
-Yes--

97
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:39,083
You'd better not run and hide
when she clears her exams!

98
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,958
Guys, I mean…

99
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,333
I know we're just joking around,

100
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,750
but I can't accept this challenge.

101
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,375
-Why?
-Why? Are you scared?

102
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,958
-Hey, shut up. She's not scared.
-No,

103
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,083
-he's right. I am scared.
-Why?

104
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,458
Because then I would have to see
my brother lose the challenge.

105
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,875
What a great comeback!

106
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,542
-You're dead meat!
-Bro, no. Stop it.

107
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,708
-Stop it, bro!
-Hey, careful!

108
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,208
-You'll hurt yourself!
-Hey, what's happening?

109
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,458
-Guys, you'll fall, careful.
-Dhananjay, what happened? Calm down.

110
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:11,625
-What is it?
-Yeah, tell me.

111
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,083
Priyanka, tell them what happened.

112
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,500
You are so going to lose.

113
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,042
-We'll see.
-Yes, you will.

114
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,750
Dhananjay, you don't have to wait
for her results to sing her praises.

115
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,583
I have fixed Ananya's marriage with a guy.

116
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,458
-What?
-Is this really true?

117
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,958
-Yes.
-What? Ananya, don't tell me! What's this?

118
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,750
If you hear the guy's name,

119
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,042
then, even now,
you'll shower her with your praises.

120
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,500
-Wow, that's great.
-When did this happen?

121
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,417
Wait a minute.

122
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:40,833
Who is this guy?

123
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,667
Hello.

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,125
This is Madhavrao Sarpotdar.

125
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,708
Yes, I know.
They're big shots in our village.

126
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,167
But they're not concerned
about our financial condition.

127
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:03,083
They just want a beautiful, educated,
and a well-behaved girl.

128
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,833
But Dad, what about my CA finals?

129
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,583
You know it's my dream.

130
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,875
It's our dream.

131
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,500
And now, theirs too.

132
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,375
That's why we've only agreed
to do the engagement now.

133
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,500
The wedding will happen after your exam.

134
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,667
Still, don't you think we're rushing it?

135
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,000
You trust me, right?

136
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,625
-Of course, Dad.
-Then just wait and watch.

137
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,250
Your life will be filled with so much joy

138
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,833
that both of your hands won't
be enough to contain it.

139
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:41,667
Do one thing.

140
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,125
See the guy's photo.

141
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,417
If you don't like him,
I'll respect your decision.

142
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,125
Please wait outside.

143
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,667
The doctor will speak
to you once he's here.

144
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,500
This is a small gift from us.

145
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,500
Thank you.

146
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,167
-Where is he?
-Please have a seat.

147
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:11,792
-This is Suhas Nikam.
-Namaste.

148
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,167
-Namaste.
-He's an LIC agent.

149
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,958
-He's our neighbor.
-I live right there.

150
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,458
-Oh, God!
-What are you doing?

151
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,667
Dad's blocking my view.

152
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,708
Please sit.

153
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,708
He is hot.

154
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,875
He's my son, Dhananjay.

155
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,583
-He's got a distinction in MBA.
-I see.

156
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,875
He's currently looking for a job.

157
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,625
-That's great. All the best.
-Thank you.

158
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,000
Dhananjay…

159
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,833
check on the refreshments.

160
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,292
Auntie…

161
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:52,417
something's fishy.

162
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,333
I mean…

163
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,417
Dad is an ordinary officer.

164
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,833
And they are the owners of MS Corporation.

165
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,792
They just knew each other formally.

166
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,042
Then where did this marriage come from?
He saw Ananya's photo

167
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,833
and fell in love with her? Just like that?

168
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,542
Is it that easy?

169
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,708
This only happens in movies.

170
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,208
Don't you think it's odd?

171
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,042
Which direction do you face
while sleeping?

172
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,750
Go.

173
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,875
-Go and serve them this.
-But--

174
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:26,792
-Just go.
-Tell me--

175
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,458
I sleep upside down.

176
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,792
Ask them if they'd like to have something.

177
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,000
No, thank you.

178
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,625
But I must say,
the carrot halvah is amazing.

179
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,875
Yes, it's delicious.

180
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,375
-Ananya made it.
-Really?

181
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,667
Dad-- Dad made it.

182
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,125
She hates lying.

183
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,583
Okay, but I loved that she lied.

184
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,958
They're childhood friends.

185
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,500
She loves Ananya.

186
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,875
-Okay.
-I see.

187
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Anyway, if you want
to ask her something, please…

188
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,667
Not at all.

189
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,833
In fact, if she asks me
to sing, I'll gladly do it.

190
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,333
Even my wife and Shekhar won't
mind showcasing their skills.

191
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,292
Right, Shekhar?

192
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,667
Hey, stop it.

193
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,917
But on a serious note,

194
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,500
I'd like to say something
if you guys don't mind.

195
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,542
-Why an arranged marriage?
-Sorry?

196
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:34,708
I mean…

197
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,375
did you not like…

198
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,958
anyone until now?

199
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,750
Honestly,

200
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,958
it's not like I didn't like anyone.

201
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,333
But very honestly,

202
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:59,792
I never met anyone who would make me go…

203
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,333
"This is it.

204
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,208
She's the one."

205
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,833
-We'll take your leave, Mr. Deshmukh.
-Yeah.

206
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,167
-We'll be waiting for Ananya's answer.
-Yes, sir.

207
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,500
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

208
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,458
By the way, Mr. Dhananjay,

209
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,375
please come and meet me in my office.

210
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,167
I'd like you to join our company
as a business development manager.

211
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,375
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

212
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,417
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

213
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,458
All the best.

214
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,417
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

215
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,333
See you, dear.

216
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,000
Keep it up.

217
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,708
-Dude…
-Congrats, dear.

218
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,750
Congratulations.

219
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,417
-Dhananjay…
-Yes?

220
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:57,917
Where is your dad?

221
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,292
-How did this happen?
-Ananya was on her bicycle

222
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,625
when a tempo hit her.

223
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,792
Deshmukh, what did the doctor say?

224
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,375
Deshmukh!

225
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,458
-No, Deshmukh--
-I'm very happy today.

226
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,125
-No…
-I won't listen to you.

227
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,083
What's this behavior? Oh, God!

228
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,625
Ananya found her happiness,
but even I found something today.

229
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,167
I never told you this.

230
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:51,792
But today, I will.

231
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,125
Back in our village,

232
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,333
our family…

233
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,833
was well known.

234
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:07,250
We had a big house and our own farm.
We were rich.

235
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,083
We were respected.

236
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:10,750
We were happy.

237
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,125
My dad was a simple man.
He was very naive.

238
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,208
My uncle…

239
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,917
took advantage of my dad's simple nature.

240
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,917
He cajoled money from him

241
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:32,167
in the name of so-called brotherhood.

242
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,542
We never even realized it.

243
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,583
My dad…

244
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,167
couldn't bear that shock.

245
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:39,667
Relax.

246
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,083
Relax.

247
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:47,583
That night, I decided
to go and question my uncle.

248
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,375
But Sunita stopped me.

249
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,500
We left our village, our home, and came
to Pune only because she insisted.

250
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,500
We started afresh.

251
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,417
We worked hard.

252
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,292
We raised our children.

253
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,917
Everything was going well.

254
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,708
But then, all of a sudden, Sunita left me.

255
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,792
Again, I ended up being alone.

256
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,333
I just didn't know what to do.

257
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,042
And these scoundrels from our village

258
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,542
were laughing at me.

259
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,167
They would say,
"He's acting as if he's some big shot."

260
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,250
Now, I'll show them…

261
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,500
who I really am!

262
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:46,750
I'll make sure my uncle witnesses
the grandeur of Ananya's wedding.

263
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,833
At the wedding,

264
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,167
I'll be standing tall…

265
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,000
right next to Mr. Sarpotdar.

266
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,000
At the wedding, these scoundrels will
raise their hands to bless the couple,

267
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,667
but their heads will be hanging in shame.

268
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,208
That's it.

269
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,625
I can't wait to bruise my uncle's ego…

270
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,917
at Ananya's engagement tomorrow.

271
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,917
-Tell me.-Are you sure?

272
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,750
Remember me? I am Shekhar Sarpotdar.

273
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,500
We recently got engaged.

274
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,583
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,583
I know I have been
ignoring you a lot lately.

276
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:40,500
But what can I do? Tell me.

277
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,292
You are distracting me.

278
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,417
I read your WhatsApp messages
more than my books nowadays.

279
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,625
At the library,

280
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,000
I sit in the corner…

281
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,125
and listen to your voice messages.

282
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,083
I talk to you every day on my way home.

283
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,333
And then, you FaceTime me, and I…

284
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,000
JANAKI HOUSE 1950

285
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,250
What are you doing here?

286
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,292
We're going on a long drive.

287
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,750
You're joking, right?

288
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,667
Not at all.

289
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:27,917
I'm going to fail.

290
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,167
I'm surely going to fail.

291
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,542
What do you mean?

292
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,417
Are you planning to see me

293
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,875
directly at our wedding?

294
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:38,667
-You're overreacting.
-No, I'm not.

295
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,125
By the way, what is it called?

296
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,750
-What do couples exchange at the wedding?
-Vows.

297
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,708
-Vows.
-Yes.

298
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,417
Are you directly going to see me then?

299
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:46,750
-Yeah.
-What?

300
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,208
Did you forget that your parents want
an educated girl as their daughter-in-law?

301
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,292
What if I fail the exam
and they refuse to accept me?

302
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:57,125
Not a problem. I'll leave them for you.

303
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:00,958
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-No, I'm not joking.

304
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,083
I'm not doubting you.

305
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,208
Okay, I promise.

306
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,625
I promise once I feel
I'm well prepared for the exam,

307
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,875
I'll see you…

308
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:12,792
once a month.

309
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,042
Twice a month?

310
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:20,167
-Okay, thrice a month. That's it.
-Okay, done.

311
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,500
Okay.

312
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,083
But only on one condition.

313
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,417
Right now, we're going on a long drive.

314
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,833
Why don't we go…

315
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,083
-on a long drive next month--
-Okay, fine.

316
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,667
Keep studying hard. Do well in the exam.

317
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,833
Make your family proud.
Who am I, anyway? Right?

318
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,167
-No problem. Bye.
-Listen to me-- Okay.

319
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,167
Okay. Done.

320
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,250
But even I have one condition.

321
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,875
Let's go.

322
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:52,958
Magic.

323
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,292
Thank you.

324
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,417
Mr. Sarpotdar, think about it.
You can still back down.

325
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,500
Are you sure you can do it?

326
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,750
Ms. Deshmukh, I promise.

327
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,375
This ride…

328
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,750
will be the most memorable
ride in your life.

329
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,333
Sh…

330
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,833
Shekhar…

331
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,250
He's had a minor injury.
There is nothing to worry about.

332
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,833
No!

333
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,750
No!

334
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,667
No.

335
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,208
I shouldn't have said yes to her.

336
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,167
We should have gone by car.

337
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:54,125
Shekhar, please don't think about it now.

338
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:55,500
Relax, okay?

339
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,333
Relax.

340
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:01,917
Mr. Deshmukh…

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,208
Shekhar has been discharged.

342
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:15,042
-Okay.
-Please take care of Ananya.

343
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,250
-If you need any help--
-No.

344
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,208
Thank you.

345
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,917
Mr. Deshmukh, don't worry.

346
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,625
We're all there with you.

347
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,417
Take care, okay?

348
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:44,833
Dad…

349
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,333
I'll go and see Ananya.

350
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,333
She's asleep.

351
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:46,583
I'll come later.

352
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,375
Shall we go, Dad?

353
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:51,667
Bye.

354
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,833
Hey, you're up?

355
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,750
What happened? Are you in pain?

356
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,292
-No, there is something in my eye.
-Okay.

357
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,167
I'm fine.

358
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,625
You just missed him.

359
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,292
Shekhar was discharged.

360
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,333
So, he had come to see you.

361
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,083
But he said you were asleep.

362
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,792
He said he'd come to see you later.

363
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,375
He was feeling really bad
about what happened to you.

364
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,417
He loves you so much.

365
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,375
In fact, all of us love you.

366
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,417
You know what?
Mr. Sarpotdar had come to see me.

367
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,292
He held my hand tightly…

368
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,042
and said, "Don't worry.

369
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,708
We're all there for you."

370
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,542
They're very kind people.

371
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:19,167
Hey.

372
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,583
Don't think that everything's
finished, alright?

373
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:28,042
Don't ever think that I'd be
embarrassed to walk with you

374
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:31,792
just because people stare--

375
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,000
No. You'd better not think that.

376
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:40,917
I…

377
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:43,667
Are you mad?

378
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,792
Just take care of yourself, dear.
Don't worry about anything else.

379
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:50,875
Take care.

380
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,667
Everything will be fine.

381
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,250
He loves you so much.

382
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,667
He said he'd come to see you later.

383
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,667
They're very kind people.

384
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,417
Don't think that everything's
finished, alright?

385
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,083
Don't ever think that I'd be
embarrassed to walk with you

386
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,417
just because people stare--

387
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,167
You'd better not think that.

388
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:05,167
AVINASH M. DESHMUKH

389
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,042
-Priyanka…
-Yes.

390
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,083
Let's go.

391
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:50,708
You didn't take me seriously earlier,
but at least, listen to me now.

392
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,833
Throw away that broken bicycle!

393
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,917
Rama, it was just an accident.

394
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,250
Here.

395
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,625
Careful.

396
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,208
OFFICE

397
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,292
Hello.

398
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,583
Mr. Sarpotdar, it's me. Yes.

399
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:32,250
Ananya was discharged from
the hospital yesterday.

400
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:36,000
We took her home.
So, I thought I should inform you.

401
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:39,292
Yeah. She's fine.

402
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:42,458
How is Shekhar?

403
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,792
He had said he'd come to see her.

404
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,083
He went abroad?

405
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,583
For work?

406
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,542
Oh, you'll be coming to see her together!

407
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,000
When-- Hello?

408
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,750
-Hello!
-Deshmukh.

409
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:07,667
Hello?

410
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,917
-Deshmukh, come on, hurry up. Sir--
-Yes, coming.

411
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,375
Hello?

412
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,125
Bro, is Dad alright?

413
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:26,125
He's just worried about your wedding.
Nothing else.

414
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,583
Don't worry. Everything will be alright.

415
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:36,917
You know how he is.

416
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:42,292
Bro, I think we should tell him…

417
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,583
that what he wants is
not going to happen now.

418
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,500
-Because Shekhar--
-Won't say no to you.

419
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,083
Am I right?

420
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,375
I mean, we all know…

421
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,833
how much he loves you.

422
00:35:58,875 --> 00:35:59,708
Exactly.

423
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,500
Bro!

424
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:03,292
You know…

425
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,042
Mr. Sarpotdar had told me…

426
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,375
that he would fix my meeting
with his company's HR for my job.

427
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,042
So…

428
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,250
Don't worry about Dad.

429
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,417
Ananya.

430
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,000
Ananya!

431
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,500
-Dad--
-Dad, I don't want to get married.

432
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:04,792
What?

433
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,333
Yes. I don't want
to be a burden on anyone.

434
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,875
-Burden?
-Wait, Dad.

435
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:15,708
Hey…

436
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,417
you were telling me something
else before some time.

437
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:19,875
No, bro.

438
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:24,083
I was telling you exactly this,
but I guess you didn't get it.

439
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,792
Dad, please try to understand.
Call them right now

440
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,417
and tell them
that I don't want to get married.

441
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,167
Ananya, do you think marriage is a joke?

442
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:39,458
I have already told everyone in the
village. All our relatives know about it.

443
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,208
Dad-- Listen to me, Ananya.

444
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,000
You will have to get married
someday, right?

445
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,708
Everything might not be so easy then.

446
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:48,167
I don't care, bro.

447
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:51,958
Dad, why don't you understand?

448
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,750
Just break off the engagement
before they break it off.

449
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,583
-But why would they break it off?
-Exactly.

450
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:00,375
Dear, Mr. Sarpotdar held my hand

451
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,417
and promised me.

452
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:05,000
Do you not believe me? Let's call them.

453
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,417
-Let me call them.
-Dad!

454
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,458
-I'll talk to them.
-Dad, don't. Please tell him.

455
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,542
-Why are you being impatient?
-Please tell him to stop.

456
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,250
Wait. Let him call them.

457
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,750
Dad, that day, Shekhar--

458
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,958
-Hello.
-Yes.

459
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:16,875
Mr. Sarpotdar…

460
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:18,667
-Tell me.
-Yeah.

461
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,833
I called you to ask…

462
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,750
you were going to come
to see Ananya, right?

463
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,583
When are you coming?

464
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:30,208
Actually, Mr. Deshmukh…

465
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,458
I wanted to tell you
this face-to-face, but--

466
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Please don't get me wrong.

467
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,875
But we don't think

468
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,208
we can go ahead with this wedding anymore.

469
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:44,833
And…

470
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,333
I hope you understand
where we're coming from.

471
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,667
Hello?

472
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:54,792
That day…

473
00:38:56,583 --> 00:39:01,208
Shekhar purposely left
without meeting me, Dad.

474
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,375
But Dad, don't worry, okay?

475
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:17,417
I'll manage. I'll live on my own.

476
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,250
Bro, please talk to him.

477
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,208
Dad…

478
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:29,208
you are most important to me.

479
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:48,458
After what happened,
my family should have felt bad.

480
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,958
-But they are feeling angry.
-Can you blame them?

481
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,417
After what the Sarpotdars did to us…

482
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,292
anyone would feel angry.

483
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:04,125
But I didn't expect him
to marry me after the accident.

484
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,917
In fact, I would have requested
him not to marry me.

485
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,208
What surprised me is that…

486
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,292
he didn't even say goodbye
to me before leaving.

487
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:27,792
What is your password?

488
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:32,917
Password!

489
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:36,750
Shekhar.

490
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,500
Now, listen to me carefully.

491
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:45,958
From now on,

492
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,500
you will not think about Shekhar ever.

493
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:52,167
You will not even talk about him…

494
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,292
swear on me.

495
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,250
Now, you're single.

496
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,833
And your new password is… "Ananya."

497
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,333
Bro.

498
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,042
Bro!

499
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,583
Bro!

500
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:42,583
Bro!

501
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:34,417
Ananya!

502
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,875
Ananya!

503
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,083
She is not here.

504
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:44,542
Ananya!

505
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,208
Ananya!

506
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,083
-Ananya--
-Dad, stop.

507
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,333
Call Priyanka.

508
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,083
Thirty thousand?

509
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,042
It's too much.

510
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,208
Okay. Thank you.

511
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,542
What happened, Deshmukh?

512
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,958
-Sir, tea.
-I am looking for a nurse for Ananya.

513
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,542
But it's expensive.

514
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:37,292
Isn't your son MBA?

515
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:38,958
What is he doing?

516
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:58,542
Bro--

517
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,208
Don't lose hope.

518
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,458
You will get a job.

519
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,125
I know that.

520
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,292
But Dad doesn't seem to understand.

521
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,000
What happened?

522
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:19,292
He says that even though I am an MBA,

523
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,375
right now, my degree is of no use,
so I should just do…

524
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,292
some clerical job.

525
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:29,167
In short, he's okay
with me doing a random job

526
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,958
as long as I'm earning money.

527
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,375
-But why?
-Because of you.

528
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,042
Because he wants to hire…

529
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,500
a full-time nurse for you.

530
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:47,792
I told him that we should call some girl
from the village who needs work.

531
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,083
But he just wouldn't listen.

532
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,125
No one listens to me anyway.

533
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:01,625
Leave it. Pass me that file.

534
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:25,333
-Sorry.
-No, it's--

535
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,917
-Your friend here is a scholar, right?
-Yes, she is.

536
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,833
Then tell her to clear the CA
final exams on the first attempt.

537
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:37,833
She will. What will you do in return?

538
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:40,083
I'll sing her praises in public.

539
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,750
-Ananya!
-Yes, Dad?

540
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:34,250
Come out now. If not for you,
at least, take a break for your books!

541
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:37,042
-Dad, I'm almost done. Just two minutes.
-Okay.

542
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:38,750
You mean two hours.

543
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:01,542
Dad…

544
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:07,875
Dad!

545
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:12,292
I was thinking--

546
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,167
I was thinking…

547
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,583
that once they remove my dressing,

548
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,167
I'll start my CA preparations again.

549
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,542
Priyanka will write my exams for me.

550
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,833
And yes, you don't have
to get a nurse for me.

551
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,042
I'll manage.

552
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:39,833
Don't--

553
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:47,000
Careful.

554
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,917
Hey, drive slowly.

555
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,667
-Would you please stop irritating me?
-No! What will you do?

556
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,500
-Do whatever you want!
-Alright! That's it!

557
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,125
Bro!

558
00:49:58,542 --> 00:49:59,708
What are you doing?

559
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:02,417
If my certificates don't have any
value, why keep them?

560
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,125
Right! What else can you do!

561
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:05,833
Run away from your responsibilities!

562
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:08,583
-You can't do anything anyway!
-That's right!

563
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,667
-Bro, please wait.
-I can't do anything.

564
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,000
-After all, I am your son.
-What did you say?

565
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:16,042
Your uncle stole your property
from right under your nose.

566
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,167
-He couldn't do anything about it.
-Bro, please stop.

567
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,708
-Listen, bro--
-Ananya, don't come between us!

568
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,250
My situation right now
is not that different.

569
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:26,583
Everything is happening right
in front of my eyes, but I'm helpless.

570
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,167
Tell me, am I wrong?

571
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:31,458
-What did you do?
-Are you really asking me that?

572
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,792
Even in that situation, I stood
on my own feet. I raised you both.

573
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,083
But you forgot all that.
You only remembered

574
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:39,833
that your father didn't do anything then!

575
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,917
But let me tell you one thing!

576
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,917
I was just waiting patiently.

577
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,458
I was waiting for a perfect opportunity.

578
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:48,917
And I had got that opportunity.

579
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,625
I had planned to go to the village
after Ananya's wedding

580
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:55,667
and show off in front of everyone
who had laughed at me once.

581
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,667
Everything was going as per my plan,
but then, this happened and--

582
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:13,750
Hey, but don't think that…

583
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,208
I have lost, alright?

584
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,125
We can't do anything now, Dad.

585
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,417
I can still teach them a lesson.

586
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,875
Forget about it, Dad.

587
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:24,792
I swear I will teach them a lesson!
I won't spare them!

588
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,292
It's of no use now, Dad.

589
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,875
You should have stood your ground then.

590
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,958
I don't know about your respect,

591
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,917
but you could have surely
saved our property.

592
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,750
-It'd have been of some use to me today.
-What?

593
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:37,083
What do I have? Tell me.

594
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,833
I am begging for a job despite
having a distinction in MBA.

595
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,042
Apparently, a distinction is not enough.
Because others have strong contacts,

596
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:47,333
or luck, or money that they can offer
as a bribe in exchange for a job.

597
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:48,417
But what do I have?

598
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,875
What should I do?

599
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:54,667
By the way, who told you to go
on a long drive on a bicycle?

600
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,875
-Dhananjay--
-Answer me!

601
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:57,958
Shekhar was insisting
on going by car, right?

602
00:51:58,042 --> 00:52:01,208
But no, you just had to go by
your stupid bicycle, hadn't you?

603
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,875
And then we all know what happened!
I'm telling you…

604
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,292
I got a job,
but she just couldn't be happy for me.

605
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,125
Why would she be happy?

606
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:11,250
After all, since childhood,

607
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:14,750
all she ever wanted to do was outshine me.

608
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:16,833
-What are you--
-And you!

609
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:18,792
You only cared about Ananya!

610
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,042
Did you ever think
about anyone else other than her?

611
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:25,917
Ananya's laugh, Ananya this, Ananya that!
You were only bothered about her!

612
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:28,292
There she is! Your Ananya!

613
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,375
Go ahead and praise her to the skies!

614
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:34,292
Have you gone mad? What are you saying?

615
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,542
-Because of you, I lost my job--
-Stop it, Dhananjay!

616
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:38,958
Step back! Have you gone mad?

617
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:40,750
Go inside!

618
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,875
-Throw away that damn bicycle!
-Just go inside!

619
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:13,292
A flock of birds

620
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:19,250
Flew away

621
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,750
One of them

622
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:30,208
Got left behind

623
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:38,917
The one who used to fly high once

624
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:43,792
Is afraid of heights today

625
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:50,208
The one who used to sing once

626
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:55,958
Is not even chirping today

627
00:53:56,875 --> 00:54:01,417
The sky is filled

628
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:08,708
With dark clouds

629
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,583
One of them

630
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:21,458
Got left behind

631
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:52,958
There is no strength left

632
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:58,208
In these wings now

633
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:04,250
There is no home

634
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:09,583
To go back to

635
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:15,458
The branch has broken
The leaves have fallen

636
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,083
There is nothing but
A dark shadow everywhere

637
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:26,000
There is no ray of hope

638
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,833
All the doors

639
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:33,375
Have now closed

640
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,958
A flock of birds

641
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:46,083
Flew away

642
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,625
One of them

643
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:57,125
Got left behind

644
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,750
There seems to be

645
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:09,042
No way out

646
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,875
Is anyone there?

647
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:09,958
Priyanka!

648
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:11,958
Priyanka, can you--

649
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,875
Is anybody there?

650
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:16,167
Help! There's a fire here! Help!

651
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:18,875
Priyanka!

652
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:30,250
Help!

653
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:31,875
Help!

654
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,333
Help!

655
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,167
Help!

656
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,208
Can anybody hear me?

657
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,333
Help!

658
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:03,833
Oh my God!

659
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,833
Look at the condition of this room.

660
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:15,250
I wonder how she put out the fire!

661
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,042
It's nothing but a miracle.

662
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,042
She said she was going to sleep.

663
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,542
And I was going to be late,
that's why I locked the door.

664
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:27,708
It's my fault.

665
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:30,375
-Can this be fixed?
-I'll have to check, sir.

666
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:33,625
-Okay, I'll be right here.
-Okay, sir.

667
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,958
Hello. Hello!

668
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:39,500
Stupid network!

669
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,250
-Hello!
-Hey, what happened?

670
01:02:42,542 --> 01:02:44,292
-Whom are you calling?
-This is it.

671
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,583
Now, I will find a nurse anyhow.

672
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,583
I don't care how much it costs.

673
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,250
Mr. Deshmukh, calm down.

674
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:53,958
Priyanka, get some water.

675
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,125
Why are you worrying so much?

676
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,625
So what if Priyanka got a job?
I'll still be here.

677
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,458
I'll take care of Ananya.

678
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,083
You have already done enough for us.

679
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:06,125
-Hey, come on!
-You consider me your friend, right?

680
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:09,667
-Nikam, don't get me wrong. I just mean--
-I'll find a job.

681
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:12,875
Okay now?

682
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,583
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

683
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,292
Let's not discuss this anymore.

684
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:20,000
Sir, the bicycle can be fixed.

685
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:21,458
Do you want me to fix it?

686
01:03:22,292 --> 01:03:23,250
No.

687
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:25,375
We don't.

688
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:27,083
-You can take it.
-Okay, sir.

689
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:56,167
Ananya!

690
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:08,917
Today, I told myself…

691
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,750
that humans don't have hands since birth.

692
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,875
They only have two feet.

693
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:23,458
You are a burning fire

694
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:27,458
You are the strength in wings

695
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:40,250
You are a burning fire

696
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:44,208
You are the strength in wings

697
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:48,333
You are the tune of a song

698
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:52,708
You are a fighter

699
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:56,792
You are a storm

700
01:06:57,042 --> 01:07:00,917
You are fearless

701
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:04,833
You can carve your own path

702
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:09,333
The world will salute your determination

703
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:13,208
The world will salute your determination

704
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:17,708
The world will salute your determination

705
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:21,625
The world will salute your determination

706
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:48,500
What can she do?

707
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:50,833
Nikam, don't you know?

708
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,958
She's completely dependent on us now.

709
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:54,917
So? Do you want her to stay
at home all her life?

710
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,875
Shouldn't she go out?

711
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,542
I don't know all that. All I know is that…

712
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,292
I'm not going to have unreal
expectations from now on.

713
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:02,500
Let's go.

714
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,833
The world will salute your determination

715
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:13,792
The world will salute your determination

716
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:18,042
The world will salute your determination

717
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:22,083
The world will salute your determination

718
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:24,042
CHILD WELFARE ORGANIZATION, PUNE

719
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,667
CHILD WELFARE ORGANIZATION

720
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,583
Don't worry. We're all with you.

721
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:32,500
Thank you.

722
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:35,625
Come on, Ananya! You can do it! Do it!

723
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:37,542
Come on, quick! Quick! Right!

724
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:41,292
One, two, three.

725
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:43,750
Now, bend slowly.

726
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:45,792
Go slow.

727
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,792
Have patience

728
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:01,042
Turn your pain into your strength

729
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:05,292
Have patience

730
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:09,417
Turn your pain into your strength

731
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,875
Let your emotions fly high

732
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:18,292
The sky is the limit

733
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:22,167
Let your mind wander

734
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:26,667
It's your time to shine

735
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:30,375
You can carve your own path

736
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,917
The world will salute your determination

737
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:38,583
The world will salute your determination

738
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:41,125
Priyanka!

739
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:45,375
Priyanka, I got a job.

740
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:49,417
And you are the first person
with whom I'm sharing this news.

741
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,792
Please, don't be mad at me.

742
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:57,750
You are so concerned about how I feel…

743
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:01,875
but you hurt your sister
who loves you so much!

744
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:08,792
And by the way,
she doesn't need your help anymore.

745
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:10,875
Just wait and watch.

746
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,292
Soon, Ananya will be back
to being her own independent self.

747
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:45,792
Flowers of hope

748
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:50,167
Have bloomed again

749
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:54,333
Doors have opened

750
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:58,500
To new opportunities

751
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,708
A bright new day

752
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:06,750
Is waiting for you

753
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:10,875
It's time

754
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:14,792
For you to stand up on your own feet

755
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:21,875
Smell the fragrant fresh air

756
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:27,208
Come on, get up

757
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:32,333
And start anew

758
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:36,375
Let your emotions fly high

759
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:40,792
The sky is the limit

760
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:44,750
Let your mind wander

761
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:48,958
It's your time to shine

762
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:53,042
You can carve your own path

763
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:51,542
The world will salute your determination

764
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:55,708
The world will salute your determination

765
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,958
The world will salute your determination

766
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:04,375
The world will salute your determination

767
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:03,958
You are a lotus in the mud
You are a real diamond

768
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:08,125
You are fearless
You are unbeatable

769
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:10,333
You are a star

770
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:12,333
Shining bright in the night sky

771
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:16,500
You are the fiery lightning
You are the flowing river

772
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:20,250
You're a champ
You're a warrior

773
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:24,667
You're Laxmi, Sharda, and Durga

774
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:28,625
You're unstoppable

775
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:33,458
Knock down the obstacles in your way

776
01:14:33,542 --> 01:14:37,417
You can carve your own path

777
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:48,542
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

778
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:53,667
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

779
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:58,792
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

780
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:04,000
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

781
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:08,750
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

782
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:13,958
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

783
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:18,542
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

784
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,583
Ananya!

785
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,708
You did it!

786
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:32,625
Come on, you can be happy now!
You passed the exam!

787
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:43,958
TWO FEET OVERPOWERED 30,000 HANDS

788
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,708
She insisted on not telling you anything.

789
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,583
Because she wanted to prove herself first.

790
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:54,250
She's the one who had an accident,

791
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,292
but you two were behaving as
if you became handicapped.

792
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:00,875
Your daughter is pure gold.

793
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:02,958
She stood up on her own feet…

794
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,292
and inspired many like me in her journey.

795
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:08,250
It doesn't matter if we're heading
in the wrong direction.

796
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:11,125
As long as we have a strong determination

797
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:12,708
and we are honest,

798
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,250
the universe will help us

799
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,000
reach our destination.

800
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:19,375
I never realized…

801
01:16:21,292 --> 01:16:23,208
that my daughter is my real treasure.

802
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,750
She is my pride.

803
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:35,083
Like an idiot,
I was looking for it outside.

804
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,208
I feel ashamed to even ask
for Ananya's forgiveness.

805
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:52,167
Priyanka.

806
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:57,375
When will we be getting Ananya's
final result from the institute?

807
01:16:58,375 --> 01:16:59,292
In two days.

808
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,042
Okay, then I need your help.

809
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:18,833
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

810
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,958
Thank you.

811
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:25,458
Welcome.

812
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,500
-May I?
-Sorry.

813
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:07,292
-What--
-Hi, Ananya.

814
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:09,333
Excuse me?

815
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,292
You became a CA on your first attempt.

816
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:12,542
Congratulations.

817
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:16,167
Thank you.

818
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:21,292
I'm sorry, but do I know you?

819
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:22,958
That sorry was not needed.

820
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:24,458
-Sorry?
-Yes.

821
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:26,292
This is perfect,
but the one before that was not needed.

822
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:27,542
What do you mean?

823
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,583
You don't know me because
we're meeting for the first time.

824
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,375
-Okay.
-Jai. Jai Dixit.

825
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,083
Can I get some chilled water?

826
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:36,917
-Can you please tell me who you are?
-"Please"?

827
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,792
Come on, don't be so formal, Ananya.

828
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,625
Had you not been so formal,

829
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:45,458
I would have given you a better answer.

830
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:48,708
Actually, it's not important whether
I'm being formal or informal.

831
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:51,667
-It's important to know who you are.
-There you are.

832
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:57,458
-Who are you?
-Jai Dixit.

833
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,500
-How do you know my name?
-Someone from your building told me.

834
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:05,667
Have you been stalking me?

835
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,500
Not exactly. That would be odd.

836
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:10,083
I have just been following
you to your library.

837
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,333
You mean you come to my library?

838
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,042
Yes, the corner near
the window is my spot.

839
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,708
Now don't tell me you have also
taken the CA final exam with me.

840
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:18,708
No, I wouldn't lie like that.

841
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,083
But yes,
I have clicked your many pictures.

842
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:22,708
Here is the latest one.

843
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:24,917
Today, I am giving it to you because…

844
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:27,292
Wish you a very happy birthday, Ananya.

845
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,875
Okay. Now, can you tell me
why you're doing this?

846
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,208
Yes, sure. In fact,
I was dying to tell you this.

847
01:19:37,292 --> 01:19:38,792
Actually, Ananya, I love you.

848
01:19:44,792 --> 01:19:45,708
I love you.

849
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,625
What?

850
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:52,000
I love you. Yes.

851
01:19:58,125 --> 01:19:58,958
Okay.

852
01:19:59,958 --> 01:20:00,875
Okay.

853
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,000
Now what?

854
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:06,875
Nothing. Don't think about it much.
Just say yes.

855
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:09,583
-Then we'll get married.
-And why would I do that?

856
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:11,625
Because I deserve it.

857
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:16,667
Look, Ananya, I'm ready
to tell you everything about me.

858
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,625
But what if I don't want to hear it?

859
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:21,542
Doesn't matter. So, you already
know my name. It's Jai Dixit.

860
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:25,083
I'm 28 years old. I passed my
BSc exam on my second attempt.

861
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,750
To be honest, I don't earn a lot.

862
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:29,500
But I'm happy with whatever I earn.

863
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,625
I wake up at 11:00 a.m. every day.

864
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:35,833
I drink when I get bored,
and I smoke… often.

865
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,917
What a personality! What a biodata!

866
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,083
God bless you. Now, please leave.

867
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,708
We haven't even gotten
to the best part yet.

868
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:44,667
-Oh, we're not done?
-No.

869
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,500
-Talk to the table then.
-Ananya!

870
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:47,667
Ananya, just hear me out.

871
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:50,667
At least, accept my gift.
You didn't even finish your meal.

872
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:52,750
More importantly,
you didn't let me finish my intro.

873
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,625
Come on, kid. Let the wooing begin.

874
01:20:56,667 --> 01:21:00,500
The only thing that has managed to impress
me more than you is this camera.

875
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:03,125
I swear, Ananya. It has taught me a lot.
Listen, Ananya.

876
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:04,583
This camera taught me a lot.

877
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:07,333
It taught me how to focus
on important things in life

878
01:21:07,417 --> 01:21:09,542
and ignore the unimportant ones.

879
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,500
-Listen--
-See this.

880
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,167
Just click this button,

881
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:16,792
and your favorite moment
will freeze forever.

882
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:19,875
Then you can carry it your whole life.

883
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,083
Interesting, right?
This is my passion now.

884
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:25,000
-Are you done?
-Not yet.

885
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,292
-Yeah.
-Are you done now?

886
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,542
-Just a minute.
-Hey--

887
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,083
-Yeah.
-I am not interested.

888
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:37,042
Ananya! Listen!

889
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:38,833
Ananya.

890
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,667
-Please don't think that--
-Excuse me!

891
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:45,292
Don't worry,
I'm not feeling pity for myself.

892
01:21:46,292 --> 01:21:47,917
I want a life partner.

893
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:49,875
But even I have a choice.

894
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:52,542
Let's go.

895
01:22:17,667 --> 01:22:21,417
-Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

896
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:25,625
-Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

897
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:30,208
-Happy birthday, dear Ananya!
-Happy birthday, dear Ananya!

898
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:34,500
-Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

899
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:42,458
-Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

900
01:23:42,542 --> 01:23:46,000
-Happy birthday, dear Ananya!
-Happy birthday, dear Ananya!

901
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:49,833
-Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

902
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:53,417
Enjoy the cake.

903
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:02,958
God bless you.

904
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,667
Priyanka.

905
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:58,542
It's time to fulfill my promise.

906
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:01,833
-Bro, please don't. I'll fall.
-Hey, be careful.

907
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:04,125
-Hey, don't let her fall.
-Bro, please stop it now.

908
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,417
-Walk slowly, please!
-Careful!

909
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,292
-Hey, she'll fall!
-Be careful!

910
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:11,167
She'll be scared.
Come on, get her down now.

911
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,875
-Careful.
-Careful.

912
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:13,875
Slowly.

913
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:14,917
He's so loving.

914
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,542
-Guys, let's take a photo.
-Yes!

915
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,375
-I want her to do this in the photo.
-No way.

916
01:26:19,458 --> 01:26:22,083
-We should ask someone to take our photo.
-Let's ask someone--

917
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:25,958
-What if you had dropped me?
-Hey, it's a brand-new phone. Be careful.

918
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:27,167
-Ready?
-Smile!

919
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,333
You!

920
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:34,625
-What are you doing here?
-Photo.

921
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:36,333
You forgot to take it from me that day.

922
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:39,458
I thought you must be
feeling bad about it.

923
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:41,708
And I didn't want you to feel bad.

924
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:43,750
-That's why I came here.
-What happened, dear?

925
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:46,792
-Who is he?
-Hello, Dad. I'm Jai Dixit.

926
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:48,667
Hey, Dhananjay. How are you, buddy?

927
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:51,208
Auntie, namaste. You're looking beautiful.

928
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:54,292
-Uncle, all okay?
-Hey…

929
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,833
Priyanka, nice dress.

930
01:26:56,583 --> 01:26:58,417
-Nice choice, actually.
-Are you done?

931
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:01,333
Give me the photo and leave.

932
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:03,458
-Why is she--
-Why is she being so rude?

933
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:04,833
-Photo.
-Why…

934
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:07,750
-That was a bit rude.
-Hey, sorry, but…

935
01:27:08,042 --> 01:27:09,250
have we met before?

936
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:11,833
-And yet you know me?
-Yes.

937
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:13,792
And how do you know me?

938
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,583
-The same way he knows me.
-Yes.

939
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:17,167
What's with the silly questions?

940
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:21,917
He must be Ananya's friend. He must
have come here to wish her. Am I right?

941
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,167
No, Dad.

942
01:27:23,917 --> 01:27:25,958
-Who told you he's my friend?
-He's not?

943
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:27,708
-Then who is he?
-Jai Dixit.

944
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:28,958
-What the--
-Jai…

945
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:30,250
We heard that.

946
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,625
Wait a minute. Ananya.

947
01:27:33,417 --> 01:27:35,125
-He is not from our college, right?
-Right.

948
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,833
-Was he in our CA class?
-No.

949
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:39,417
-Would you stop?
-Wait, wait!

950
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:41,250
-He was not in your college.
-No.

951
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,292
-He was not in your CA class.
-No.

952
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:44,542
And yet he is here?

953
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:46,208
Not just me, all of us are here.

954
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:50,750
Then tell me one thing.
Why don't we sit somewhere

955
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,708
-and discuss this?
-No, listen to me.

956
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:54,375
Good point. Let's sit and discuss this.

957
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,375
-Yeah, let's sit here.
-Excuse me, get us some bhel poori!

958
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:59,667
-Guys, don't entertain him.
-Come. Please sit.

959
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:02,458
-But what exactly are we…
-Dad, please sit.

960
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:03,917
What are you guys doing?

961
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,542
-Would you guys have bhel poori?
-Well…

962
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,667
-Bhel poori?
-Right now?

963
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:11,042
-Yes.
-Alright. I'll have…

964
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:13,000
-the plain one.
-Oh my God!

965
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:14,000
Do you have sev poori?

966
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:16,167
One plate of sev poori.
What would you have, Dhananjay?

967
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,292
-Anything would do.
-Dad.

968
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,583
-Dad, what about you?
-I'll just have a taste.

969
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:19,500
Okay.

970
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:21,292
Now, if you have any questions--

971
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,250
Hello!

972
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:24,750
I'm leaving.

973
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,167
-Ananya!
-Stop her. What happened to her?

974
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,458
The girl just wouldn't let us eat.

975
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:31,625
-Ananya!
-What…

976
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,083
Should I make it or not?

977
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,750
Go ahead. Somebody will eat it.

978
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,333
-Ananya!
-Ananya!

979
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:40,542
-Ananya!
-Ananya, wait!

980
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:42,417
-Listen!
-Ananya! Stop!

981
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,833
-Ananya!
-No, you guys continue.

982
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:45,417
Have bhel poori.

983
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,625
I think she's upset about the photo.

984
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:49,417
Okay, but whose photo is it?

985
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:52,125
-Ananya's.
-Why do you have it?

986
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:55,208
He must have clicked it.
Don't you see he has a camera?

987
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:57,000
-I got it.
-What?

988
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:59,083
Ananya, please wait.

989
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,583
-No.
-They are going to find out someday.

990
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:03,417
-Find out what?
-Oh, God!

991
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:07,917
-What are they going to find out?
-That I want to marry you.

992
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,958
-You--
-What?

993
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:10,792
-What?
-I knew it.

994
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:12,750
-What are you saying--
-What happened?

995
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,208
Why are you staring at me like that?

996
01:29:15,542 --> 01:29:18,208
-You want to get her married, right?
-Yes.

997
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:21,417
Then what's the issue?
She is a nice girl. She is beautiful.

998
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:25,417
You are right.
We want to get her married…

999
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,042
-but--
-What?

1000
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,792
Nikam, Dhananjay, help me here.

1001
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:32,542
-Ananya, how could you not tell me?
-You should have talked to us.

1002
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,667
-Tell her…
-Please keep quiet!

1003
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,958
Now, only I'll speak!
If someone interrupts me,

1004
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,542
-I'll jump in the water.
-Hey, come on.

1005
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:41,917
Listen,

1006
01:29:42,417 --> 01:29:44,167
I have nothing to do with him.

1007
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:46,875
In fact, he met me yesterday
for the first time.

1008
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:50,292
Even yesterday, he was talking rubbish.
And now, he's come here too.

1009
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:51,542
Got it?

1010
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:54,208
Except for the "talking rubbish"
part, everything else is true.

1011
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:56,000
-That's exactly what happened.
-Wait.

1012
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,500
How can you talk to my daughter like that?

1013
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:00,792
-Exactly.
-How else should I have talked to her?

1014
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:03,958
I mean how can you just
say you love her like that?

1015
01:30:04,042 --> 01:30:06,708
-You--
-Is there any other way to say that?

1016
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:09,292
No, I mean,
how dare you propose marriage to her

1017
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:10,750
right in front of me!

1018
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:13,708
Marriage is the next step of love, Dad.

1019
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:16,167
It does sound a bit funny, doesn't it?

1020
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:20,125
-Okay, that's enough.
-Keep quiet.

1021
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:23,542
Nikam, Dhananjay, are you guys
going to do something, or should I--

1022
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:25,917
No, Dad-- Bro, wait. Let me handle this.

1023
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:28,125
Listen, you…

1024
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,667
leave from here right now.

1025
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,833
Otherwise, we'll be forced to make
a complaint against you. So, just leave.

1026
01:30:34,292 --> 01:30:36,250
No, please don't do that.

1027
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,917
It's not going to help anyone.

1028
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,250
Instead, if you just say yes to me,
it'll be very helpful.

1029
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:41,792
Priyanka, I can't handle him anymore.

1030
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:43,792
-Hey, behave yourself--
-Priyanka, wait.

1031
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:44,750
-What!
-Listen--

1032
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:45,875
Dhananjay, wait.

1033
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:47,583
Dad, wait.

1034
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:49,958
You know what the problem is?

1035
01:30:50,042 --> 01:30:52,667
We need to have communication,
but there is only confusion.

1036
01:30:53,208 --> 01:30:56,042
See, I can understand.
You guys are very happy.

1037
01:30:56,375 --> 01:31:01,250
This news is hard to digest.
But it's okay. We'll talk about it later.

1038
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,958
Okay? Now, I'll get going
because I'm a bit busy.

1039
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,875
Bye, Dad. Ananya.

1040
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,958
You--

1041
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:14,042
-This guy was a pain in the neck.
-I know, right?

1042
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:18,000
I still don't know who he is!

1043
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:19,542
Jai Dixit.

1044
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:21,917
Was that a joke?

1045
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,833
CHILD WELFARE ORGANIZATION, PUNE

1046
01:31:24,917 --> 01:31:25,750
Ananya.

1047
01:31:26,417 --> 01:31:28,625
I need to go somewhere urgently.

1048
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,958
I have talked to him.

1049
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:34,083
-Will you please show him around the NGO?
-Yes, ma'am. Don't worry.

1050
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:35,917
-Alright. I'll leave now.
-Yeah.

1051
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:39,333
Let's go.

1052
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,833
Hi, sir.

1053
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:55,792
How are you, Ananya?

1054
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:03,667
I'm good, sir.

1055
01:32:04,708 --> 01:32:06,750
Ms. Smita asked me
to show you around the NGO.

1056
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:10,042
I know…

1057
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,042
you must have been surprised…

1058
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:15,292
to see me here.

1059
01:32:15,917 --> 01:32:18,583
I have been trying to get in
touch with you for a long time.

1060
01:32:19,375 --> 01:32:20,500
Today, we're finally here.

1061
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:22,500
I'm really happy.

1062
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:27,375
You'll be happier after meeting
the kids in the NGO, sir.

1063
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:29,208
Shall we?

1064
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:31,708
Please come, sir.

1065
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:34,000
This NGO has been doing phenomenal work

1066
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:37,000
for the welfare of physically handicapped
children for the past 12 years.

1067
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:40,458
They allow admission
to only 50 students every year

1068
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:42,583
so that they can attend
to each of them personally.

1069
01:32:42,667 --> 01:32:43,625
Ananya, listen.

1070
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,583
I want to talk to you.

1071
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:48,125
Yes, sir. We will talk to the kids.

1072
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:51,208
But before that, let me give you
a brief introduction to the NGO.

1073
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:53,958
Here, we have two types
of handicapped kids.

1074
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:58,083
Those who are born handicapped and those
who became handicapped after an accident.

1075
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:01,917
Their agony is similar.

1076
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:05,458
But the struggle of those
who become handicapped

1077
01:33:05,542 --> 01:33:07,083
after an accident is unimaginable.

1078
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:09,083
Please, this way.

1079
01:33:12,542 --> 01:33:15,125
Ananya, I know I have hurt you.

1080
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:16,375
-You are upset with me.
-Hello.

1081
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:17,792
You might even be mad at me.

1082
01:33:18,167 --> 01:33:19,417
But these things happen.

1083
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:24,083
Sometimes, we end up doing things
that we never intend to do.

1084
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,458
Mental grooming.

1085
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:26,958
It's our first task.

1086
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:28,375
Please come, sir.

1087
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:36,667
Because of certain bitter
experiences in our lives,

1088
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:39,667
we feel weak and helpless.

1089
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:41,458
Here, they teach us
to overcome those feelings.

1090
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:43,792
After that accident,
everything changed, Ananya.

1091
01:33:44,292 --> 01:33:45,500
What else could I have done?

1092
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:47,750
It sure does feel
difficult in the beginning.

1093
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:51,625
-But eventually, we learn to deal with it.
-Even I was hurt because of what happened!

1094
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:54,417
Sorry.

1095
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,625
Let's talk to the kids, sir.

1096
01:34:10,042 --> 01:34:12,583
Our second task is to teach
children to be independent.

1097
01:34:12,667 --> 01:34:14,667
-I agree I should have come to see you--
-Satish.

1098
01:34:14,792 --> 01:34:16,000
-Hi.
-I should have talked to you--

1099
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,292
-That's Saket.
-But…

1100
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:20,792
I didn't know how my friends
and family would react to my decision.

1101
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:23,250
-I just didn't know what to do.
-Santosh, Sangita,

1102
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:24,833
-and Irfan.
-Why don't you understand?

1103
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:26,333
And this is Shailendra.

1104
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:29,417
He's a part of the Indian
Wheelchair Cricket Team.

1105
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:33,042
-How is the practice going?
-No matter what happens…

1106
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:37,333
Mom and Dad would have
never agreed to this.

1107
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:42,250
This is Om, sir.

1108
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:46,917
-Om.
-Hi.

1109
01:34:47,125 --> 01:34:48,750
This is Mr. Shekhar Sarpotdar.

1110
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,333
-Hello.
-He's a businessman.

1111
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:53,375
Sir, he just finished
the trek of Fort Sinhgad.

1112
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:56,042
And he wishes to go to many
more such treks, right?

1113
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:57,000
Right.

1114
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,583
Thank you.

1115
01:35:00,292 --> 01:35:04,667
A few months ago, Om was not even
able to step out of his house.

1116
01:35:06,042 --> 01:35:08,333
Because his parents were
not allowing him to go out.

1117
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,083
They were ashamed to go
out with him in public.

1118
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,542
But today, his parents proudly
tell everyone that he is their son.

1119
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,000
It's possible, sir.

1120
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:25,542
If we change the negative mentality
of the people around us,

1121
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:26,625
everything is possible.

1122
01:35:27,792 --> 01:35:29,750
That's our third and most important task.

1123
01:35:31,583 --> 01:35:34,625
I hope you liked the work
that our NGO is doing, sir.

1124
01:35:35,792 --> 01:35:38,375
If you want any more information,
our staff will help you.

1125
01:35:39,417 --> 01:35:41,542
I'm sorry. I need to leave urgently.

1126
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:43,333
Thank you so much, sir.

1127
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:44,917
Have a nice day.

1128
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:20,292
Everything is possible.

1129
01:36:21,417 --> 01:36:23,000
You just have to set your mind to it.

1130
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:31,208
Even if you lose all the organs
of your body, it's still possible.

1131
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:37,458
-Hello.
-Hello.

1132
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:38,375
All the best.

1133
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:39,417
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1134
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:42,458
You just have to take
care of your one organ.

1135
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,500
And that is your mind.

1136
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:54,583
Let me tell you a quote of Nick Vujicic

1137
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:58,375
who was born with no hands or legs.
He is one of the top ten

1138
01:36:58,667 --> 01:37:01,125
motivational speakers in the world.

1139
01:37:02,042 --> 01:37:03,667
"God does not make mistakes.

1140
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:05,958
He makes miracles.

1141
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:08,125
I am one of His miracles.

1142
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:09,708
Are you one too?"

1143
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:14,125
Today, even I want to ask
you the same question.

1144
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:17,042
I am also one of His miracles.

1145
01:37:17,917 --> 01:37:19,083
Are you one too?

1146
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,333
-Yes.
-Yes.

1147
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:23,125
-Are you a miracle too?
-Yes.

1148
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:25,792
-Louder. Are you a miracle too?
-Yes!

1149
01:37:41,792 --> 01:37:43,500
You should keep your hair open, Ananya.

1150
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:14,583
I don't understand.

1151
01:38:16,417 --> 01:38:17,833
After so many months,

1152
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:22,417
what made you come back and say
that you want to marry Ananya?

1153
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:25,833
Courage, Dad.
I finally have the courage to say it.

1154
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:27,875
And why now suddenly?

1155
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,875
Do your parents know you're here?

1156
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:33,708
I don't care about what they think.

1157
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:35,792
Dad, please. Please trust me.

1158
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:37,750
I really want to marry Ananya.

1159
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:40,000
-Shekhar--
-But I don't want to marry him.

1160
01:38:47,167 --> 01:38:50,708
That night, along with my hands, I also
lost the ring that Shekhar gave me.

1161
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:55,208
I would have found the ring
if that was really my destiny.

1162
01:38:58,958 --> 01:38:59,792
Sorry.

1163
01:39:02,042 --> 01:39:02,958
Ana--

1164
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:06,083
-Ananya, please.
-You know I have countless stories of An--

1165
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:07,208
Oh my God!

1166
01:39:07,292 --> 01:39:09,292
-Please hear me out.
-Look who's here! Shekhar!

1167
01:39:10,542 --> 01:39:12,333
-Shekhar!
-Shekhar's here?

1168
01:39:13,042 --> 01:39:14,667
He's even come to our house now!

1169
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,792
Forget the house,
he's even gone to the bedroom.

1170
01:39:17,208 --> 01:39:19,250
Hey, Shekhar! What's up, buddy?

1171
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:20,708
How's everyone at home?

1172
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:24,375
How are your mom and dad?
Any special occasion for the visit?

1173
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:27,000
Who is he?

1174
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:29,125
Jai Dixit. He's our friend.

1175
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:31,167
Friend?

1176
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:33,500
When did he become your friend?

1177
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:35,792
Just now while coming home.

1178
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:37,792
Oh, God!

1179
01:39:38,292 --> 01:39:40,375
It's weird, but it happens.

1180
01:39:42,917 --> 01:39:45,583
But how does he know Shekhar?

1181
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:47,875
Of course, I know Shekhar.

1182
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:51,417
He's the one who was supposed
to marry Ananya but ran away, right?

1183
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:56,042
Yes, that's right. Now, he's here
because he wants to marry her again.

1184
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:57,333
Do you have a problem with that?

1185
01:39:57,917 --> 01:39:59,333
This was unexpected.

1186
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:01,917
But it's expected from a person like you.

1187
01:40:02,292 --> 01:40:05,875
I'm sorry, dude. You were a little late.
I feel bad for him, Dad.

1188
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:07,583
He can't marry Ananya now.

1189
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,583
-Because I am going to marry her.
-What?

1190
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:10,500
-What?
-What?

1191
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:12,375
Exactly what I thought! Yes!

1192
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,500
How is that possible?

1193
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:16,167
-What's happening here?
-Our marriage discussion.

1194
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,375
So, Ananya's marriage
has already been fixed?

1195
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:20,792
And yet you guys let me
ramble on about myself?

1196
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:23,458
Didn't you guys feel like
I should know all this?

1197
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:24,875
Wait a minute.

1198
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:27,875
First of all, Ananya's marriage
is not fixed with him.

1199
01:40:28,167 --> 01:40:30,333
And even if it is fixed,
who are you to question us?

1200
01:40:30,417 --> 01:40:32,625
Yeah. He's questioning us
as if we went to him…

1201
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:34,708
-No, I didn't mean to--
-Hey, that's very rude, okay?

1202
01:40:34,792 --> 01:40:38,583
-You have no idea what we went through.
-Why did he come here in the first--

1203
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:44,458
Can I get five minutes?

1204
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:55,167
Priyanka. Please.

1205
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:01,875
You know why this issue
was stretched so much?

1206
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:04,292
-Why?
-Because you are the one with the issue.

1207
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:08,125
See, the instant reaction should always
be constant than being constantly instant.

1208
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:09,708
What? I didn't get it.

1209
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:11,708
Don't worry, I'll explain it.

1210
01:41:11,917 --> 01:41:15,208
Priyanka, what were you telling me about
Dhananjay when we were coming here?

1211
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:16,958
-Please tell everyone.
-About me?

1212
01:41:17,042 --> 01:41:18,042
Yes, about you.

1213
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:20,708
-Here?
-Yeah, of course.

1214
01:41:20,917 --> 01:41:21,750
Come on, shoot.

1215
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:25,792
I just said that…

1216
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:27,958
when Dhananjay…

1217
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:31,625
told me about Ananya's
surprise birthday party,

1218
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:34,375
I was really happy. Obviously.

1219
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:37,250
We had argued just before that.

1220
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:41,292
But I knew that Dhananjay
is not like that…

1221
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:45,458
because we have known each
other for so many years.

1222
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,542
I knew it was all just a misunderstanding.

1223
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,167
But actually, you are a very nice person.

1224
01:41:55,417 --> 01:41:57,042
Dhananjay, reply.

1225
01:41:58,917 --> 01:41:59,750
Me?

1226
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:01,167
What can I say?

1227
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,292
-You have to.
-Dad!

1228
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:05,250
-Come on.
-But--

1229
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,917
-What am I supposed to say?
-Just say it.

1230
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:09,792
Let's just finish this
topic once and for all.

1231
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,167
Dhananjay, say it!

1232
01:42:13,333 --> 01:42:14,208
Okay.

1233
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,000
No…

1234
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:21,833
I mean I just wanted to say that…

1235
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:24,333
you are also a nice girl.

1236
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:28,042
Sometimes, you behave like a child, but…

1237
01:42:28,833 --> 01:42:30,667
I find it sweet.

1238
01:42:32,167 --> 01:42:33,333
And most importantly,

1239
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:37,958
I can't thank you enough

1240
01:42:38,542 --> 01:42:41,042
for what you have done for Ananya.

1241
01:42:42,542 --> 01:42:43,625
So, thank you very much.

1242
01:42:50,792 --> 01:42:51,625
Is it?

1243
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:54,917
-This is interesting.
-Hey--

1244
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,708
I want all the deets, okay?

1245
01:42:58,542 --> 01:42:59,458
So, buddy…

1246
01:43:00,167 --> 01:43:01,542
did you get my point?

1247
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:02,833
See,

1248
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:07,167
these two had a constant belief in
their instincts about each other.

1249
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:10,458
They didn't change their beliefs instantly
just because the situation changed.

1250
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:11,833
I don't love Ananya.

1251
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:20,292
Had I really been in love with her…

1252
01:43:23,542 --> 01:43:25,750
I would have not let that accident happen.

1253
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:30,917
Yes, Ananya.

1254
01:43:33,667 --> 01:43:34,792
I was standing right behind you…

1255
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,083
to hold you.

1256
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:41,417
I had a few seconds.

1257
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:50,708
If I had worried a little less
about my own life,

1258
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,708
I would have been able to save your hands.

1259
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:00,958
That guilt…

1260
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:07,375
brought me here today.

1261
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:10,083
I was just being selfish.

1262
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,917
He's right.

1263
01:44:15,417 --> 01:44:16,792
He's absolutely right.

1264
01:44:20,417 --> 01:44:21,625
I don't deserve you.

1265
01:44:25,542 --> 01:44:27,500
Can you please do something for me?

1266
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,708
Can you forgive me?

1267
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,417
Shekhar…

1268
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:46,708
I was not mad at you…

1269
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:49,250
and…

1270
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,833
I never will be either.

1271
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:29,292
Today, because of you, we were able
to close Shekhar's chapter forever.

1272
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:33,167
Thank you.

1273
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:35,667
Now, let's talk about you.

1274
01:45:36,542 --> 01:45:37,958
You come here so easily,

1275
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,000
talk about everything so casually,

1276
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,417
and to be honest, that's confusing.

1277
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:45,417
We're just not sure if you're
really serious about Ananya or not.

1278
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:48,000
What should I do for you to believe me?

1279
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:51,542
You accept her the way she is, right?

1280
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:54,125
That makes her feel at ease.

1281
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:57,833
I am also doing the same thing, but…

1282
01:45:58,542 --> 01:46:00,667
you are not believing me.

1283
01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:02,000
Okay, convinced.

1284
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:04,458
Convinced.

1285
01:46:05,833 --> 01:46:10,083
So, let's fix an auspicious date for
the wedding and just get done with it.

1286
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,542
I am serious.

1287
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,500
What is the worst that could happen?

1288
01:46:18,083 --> 01:46:22,208
Maybe, after a few years,
he'll realize that this was a big mistake.

1289
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:24,250
It's fine.

1290
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,292
He'll say sorry and leave me.

1291
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,542
I'll handle it.

1292
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:30,500
It's okay.

1293
01:46:32,542 --> 01:46:34,125
I am strong.

1294
01:46:45,042 --> 01:46:48,583
Mr. Jai Dixit,
marriage is a big deal for me.

1295
01:46:49,667 --> 01:46:51,208
It's not as easy as you think.

1296
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:56,042
Why do you think you love me?
Tell me.

1297
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:58,792
What's so special about me?

1298
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:02,833
Or are you just trying to do something
extraordinary by marrying me?

1299
01:47:04,667 --> 01:47:06,542
Remember one thing.

1300
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:10,667
Tomorrow, if you say that
you regret your decision,

1301
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,583
I'll be completely shattered.

1302
01:47:13,417 --> 01:47:15,375
No one would be able to help me then.

1303
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,042
Not even me.

1304
01:47:20,917 --> 01:47:23,500
You are not doing this because
you feel pity for me, are you?

1305
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:26,292
If that's the case,

1306
01:47:26,375 --> 01:47:29,125
then thank you so much,
but I really don't need it.

1307
01:47:30,667 --> 01:47:31,833
So, Mr. Jai Dixit,

1308
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,208
you'd better not take me lightly.

1309
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:42,833
Instead of telling us what you feel,
tell yourself that.

1310
01:47:42,917 --> 01:47:43,792
Think about it.

1311
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:45,042
And then we'll talk.

1312
01:47:47,542 --> 01:47:48,792
I'm getting late. Bye.

1313
01:48:05,917 --> 01:48:06,875
Okay, I quit.

1314
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:10,917
I quit.

1315
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:14,083
Because I fell in love with that Ananya,

1316
01:48:14,167 --> 01:48:16,792
who had completely forgotten
that she had lost her hands.

1317
01:48:18,042 --> 01:48:19,042
But this Ananya…

1318
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:22,292
can't seem to forget that.

1319
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,208
This Ananya doesn't believe
that a normal guy

1320
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:28,417
who has two eyes, one nose, two legs,

1321
01:48:29,208 --> 01:48:30,792
and especially, two hands…

1322
01:48:32,167 --> 01:48:33,667
can fall in love with her,

1323
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:36,583
can ask her to marry him.

1324
01:48:38,583 --> 01:48:41,250
In fact, she doesn't believe that
he can be happy with her forever.

1325
01:48:44,292 --> 01:48:46,375
I am not interested
in spending my life…

1326
01:48:47,208 --> 01:48:51,500
with someone who is so weak
and has such a negative mentality.

1327
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,375
Bye.

1328
01:49:00,583 --> 01:49:01,625
-He…
-That's Jai, right?

1329
01:49:06,042 --> 01:49:08,083
Ananya, listen. Listen, please.

1330
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,083
Ananya, listen to me! Ananya!

1331
01:49:12,625 --> 01:49:15,250
I never liked anything ordinary.

1332
01:49:15,708 --> 01:49:17,875
I was always looking
for something exceptional.

1333
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:19,958
Then I found you.

1334
01:49:21,875 --> 01:49:22,833
You know what, Ananya?

1335
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:27,042
Photographers wait all their
lives to find their best shot.

1336
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,667
But luckily, I found my best shot
very early in my life.

1337
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,208
And that shot is you, Ananya.

1338
01:49:34,958 --> 01:49:37,417
Now, you tell me,
what do you want me to think about?

1339
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:38,875
And why?

1340
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:42,958
I believe we only rethink our decision
when we have options.

1341
01:49:45,333 --> 01:49:47,250
And I don't want options.

1342
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:52,250
I only know that I love you,
and no one can do anything about it.

1343
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:54,667
Except you.

1344
01:49:56,333 --> 01:49:57,708
You can say yes to me.

1345
01:50:04,708 --> 01:50:06,917
Guys, a little help here?

1346
01:50:07,625 --> 01:50:09,667
-Yes.
-Yes.

1347
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:13,375
Never mind.

1348
01:50:23,625 --> 01:50:24,750
You always say,

1349
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:27,042
"God never makes mistakes.

1350
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:29,333
He makes miracles," right?

1351
01:50:42,292 --> 01:50:43,208
Jai!

1352
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:46,542
Wow. Finally.

1353
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,625
JAI-ANANYA

1354
01:52:23,083 --> 01:52:25,000
Welcome to our newly-made home…

1355
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:26,208
Mrs. Ananya.

1356
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:31,792
I know you liked my surprise.

1357
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:33,750
Just tell me how much you liked it.

1358
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:38,208
I expected something crazy…

1359
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
but this is very sweet.

1360
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:42,875
Sweet?

1361
01:52:45,375 --> 01:52:46,417
You know what, Ananya?

1362
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:48,667
It can be naughty too.

1363
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:24,292
Jai…

1364
01:53:28,458 --> 01:53:31,042
when I think about this,

1365
01:53:32,417 --> 01:53:34,125
I feel scared…

1366
01:53:34,708 --> 01:53:38,667
whether I will be able to do it or not.

1367
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:41,333
What are you talking about?

1368
01:53:45,125 --> 01:53:46,250
I want to be a mother.

1369
01:53:49,333 --> 01:53:51,458
I want to experience motherhood.

1370
01:53:53,833 --> 01:53:56,917
I want to do everything…

1371
01:53:57,458 --> 01:53:59,083
that a mother does for her child.

1372
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:04,833
I'll be able to do it, right?

1373
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:09,542
Of course.

1374
01:54:12,292 --> 01:54:13,333
Everything is possible.

1375
01:54:15,125 --> 01:54:16,833
You just have to set your mind to it.

1376
01:54:17,792 --> 01:54:18,708
Did I say that right?

1377
01:54:22,792 --> 01:54:23,833
Jai…

1378
01:54:25,292 --> 01:54:26,417
would I be able to bathe

1379
01:54:26,917 --> 01:54:28,375
my baby with my feet?

1380
01:54:29,042 --> 01:54:30,000
Yes, why not?

1381
01:54:31,292 --> 01:54:32,292
I will…

1382
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:34,667
also massage it.

1383
01:54:35,167 --> 01:54:36,583
I'll also get it ready.

1384
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:39,167
-What about its clothes?
-I'll change its clothes.

1385
01:54:39,417 --> 01:54:41,125
And then I'll put it to sleep.

1386
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,917
I'll do everything for my baby.

1387
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:46,333
Wait a minute.

1388
01:54:47,208 --> 01:54:48,958
What am I supposed to do then?

1389
01:54:51,375 --> 01:54:52,542
You can change its diapers.

1390
01:54:54,333 --> 01:54:55,458
-Diapers?
-Yes.

1391
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,125
Okay.

1392
01:55:01,708 --> 01:55:02,875
Jai, today,

1393
01:55:04,167 --> 01:55:06,542
I am very happy.

1394
01:55:11,917 --> 01:55:12,833
You're happy, right?

1395
01:55:14,667 --> 01:55:15,875
Then let's dance.

1396
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:18,917
Ananya…

1397
01:55:21,167 --> 01:55:22,375
how about ballroom dance?
