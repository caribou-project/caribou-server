1
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:24,494
Brooklyn: This is a story
about the guy I fell for.

2
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:26,797
But to really
understand why,

3
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:30,702
You have to know
a little bit about
the game he loves.

4
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:36,674
The game has been played
by native Americans

5
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,309
For centuries.

6
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:40,544
It requires speed
and agility,

7
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,647
Teamwork, strategy,

8
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:45,216
And a bit of violence.

9
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:52,022
You may know it
as lacrosse,

10
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:54,490
But native Americans
know it as baaga'adowe...

11
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,359
The little brother of war.

12
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:57,929
Their matches took days

13
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:00,064
And were played
over Miles of terrain.

14
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:03,867
The winners got land,
wives, and sometimes glory.

15
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:11,475
There's a lot
that's different
about the game now.

16
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:14,378
But the thing
a player needs most
hasn't changed at all.

17
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:16,780
And if you find
someone who has it,

18
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,751
I'd tell you
to never let go.

19
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:28,860
(Whistle blows,
crowd cheers)

20
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:46,310
(Overlapping shouts)

21
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,146
Get it over there!
Center it!

22
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:52,582
Swing it!
Watch his pass!

23
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,386
(Shouting continues)

24
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,586
(Whistle blows)

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,155
(Shouting continues)

26
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:09,299
(Whistle blows)

27
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,402
Who's Jimmy's back-up?
Hanson.

28
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,240
We're in trouble.

29
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:17,841
(Whistle blows)

30
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,343
(Sportscast playing
on radio)

31
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,581
Hey, coach says he's
having second thoughts.

32
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:27,952
*

33
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,189
You ready for this?

34
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:33,957
I was born ready,
bro.

35
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,727
Whoa.

36
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,231
A moment with
my player, ref?

37
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,900
Hansen's the backup,
and I don't want to
hear any arguments.

38
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,501
I thought I was getting
a second chance.

39
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,171
You're arguing.

40
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:49,039
There's a delay of game
penalty with your name on it

41
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:51,809
If I don't get
a resolution A.S.A.P.

42
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,778
I can win this.

43
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:55,713
What's it gonna be,
coach?

44
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:00,317
(Whistle blows)

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,756
We'll run a switchblade
first, coach says.

46
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,322
Yeah, sure.

47
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,826
I mean it, man...
Switchblade!

48
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,227
Trying to win the
game by yourself.

49
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:12,797
My play is called
"the iceman".

50
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:16,433
I'm not talking
about your play.

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,002
Do it... switchblade.

52
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:20,872
Bring us all in.

53
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,239
You got no time
for one shot,

54
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,808
And I know wherever
you're going.

55
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,643
15 seconds?
All I need is 10.

56
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:30,481
(Whistle blows)

57
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:32,850
All right, go! Go! Go!

58
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,589
Come on, Conor!
Switchblade!

59
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,691
Run switchblade!

60
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,361
Conor, pass! Sullivan,
that's not switchblade!

61
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:20,030
(Cheering)

62
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,280
Good job out there.
Good job out there.

63
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,952
Hey, Riggins.

64
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:42,887
Hey, did that go in?
I didn't see.

65
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:45,021
Conor, man, let it go.

66
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:47,223
Come on, fighting
means suspension.

67
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,361
That was wonderful.
Yeah, nice, man.

68
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:53,263
You should call
your father.

69
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,499
The only time
he won't pick up

70
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:56,800
Is when he's
on patrol.

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,334
He's okay.

72
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,937
Dad calls that
"being in the shit".

73
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:01,404
Hey, Keegan!
Top-key mushrooms.

74
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:02,906
Maybe he didn't
pick up

75
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:04,375
Because his phone
is turned off.

76
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,643
Or maybe dad flew back
early from Iraq

77
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,312
To surprise his family.

78
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,315
Dad, you're home!
Ha ha ha!

79
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:14,418
You're looking
rather dashing,
colonel Sullivan.

80
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,452
As are you,
Mrs. Sullivan.

81
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,754
Perhaps I could escort you
home after this.

82
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:20,491
Perhaps you should.

83
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:22,359
Heh!
Aww.

84
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:24,227
Perhaps I could
escort you home
right now.

85
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:25,829
Easy, marine.
Get a room.

86
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:27,263
Ahh.

87
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,900
So, how come
you're home?

88
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,367
I'm wondering
the same thing.

89
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,336
Can't a guy just
slip away from the war

90
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,238
Without his family
thinking something's up?

91
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:36,672
No.

92
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:37,942
(Laughter)

93
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,044
I got some news.

94
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,025
I'll be right back.

95
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,860
Where are you going?

96
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,162
30 minutes, Conor.

97
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,500
Conor:
I can win this.

98
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:06,103
Dad: Other than the fact
that you let 14 get
inside your head,

99
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,372
I thought you were
ten tons of awesome.

100
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,973
Why are we
doing this, dad?
You know why.

101
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,574
We're gonna
move again.

102
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:12,977
Then they'll
call you back,

103
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:14,611
And it'll all
be for what?

104
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,380
Sorry, pal, that's
the military life.

105
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:19,582
Sometimes you gotta
just suck it up, son.

106
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:52,683
(Sighs)

107
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,855
Conor... It's
very important

108
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:02,459
That you tone your
attitude down here
on and off the field.

109
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:05,162
I had to pull some
strings to get you
in here.

110
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,666
I want you to promise me
that you'll show humility.

111
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,807
Conor, you listening
to me?

112
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,641
Not really, dad.

113
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,217
(Chuckles) Come on.

114
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,162
He's really cute.

115
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:41,331
Brooklyn: It's funny
what you notice

116
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,034
The first time
you see someone...

117
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,935
Confidence, a nice smile,

118
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,937
A little connection.

119
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,640
What you don't see...

120
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:52,009
What's impossible to know
at first glance...

121
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,078
Is everything else.

122
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,613
At least everything
that counts.

123
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,722
Hey, dad, how many
of those are yours?

124
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,458
That one.

125
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,496
And my name
is on that one.

126
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:16,699
And that was taken
right after the state
championship.

127
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,701
How many of those
did you win?

128
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,037
Four in a row.
Four?

129
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:22,438
Heh heh.
All right.

130
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:24,840
Hey, who's that
one guy you always...

131
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,510
Dave Milligan.

132
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,944
You're about
to meet him.

133
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:34,450
Straighten your tie.

134
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,986
He played on
one of the best
west coast teams ever.

135
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,556
The kid scored
70 goals last year.

136
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:41,391
Look, nobody
plays varsity
their first year.

137
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:43,094
I can't bench somebody
who's paid their dues.

138
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,695
It wouldn't be fair.

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,064
Since when are you
a stickler for propriety?

140
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,166
Why'd you
bring him here?

141
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,000
Because, despite our
considerable differences,

142
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,536
I know your reputation
as a coach,

143
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:54,270
And you turn out
a hell of a lacrosse player.

144
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:59,410
We play real lacrosse
here, not that west
coast field hockey.

145
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,477
Just play him,
see how he does.

146
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,713
I'm not asking
for favors.

147
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,617
I'm doing you
a favor just by
giving him a look,

148
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:10,887
And right now,
that's all I can
give you.

149
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:12,755
Fair enough.

150
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,403
(Indistinct chatter)

151
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,724
Can I help you?

152
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,727
Thanks,
but I'm pretty good
at dressing myself.

153
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,329
No, varsity only here.
Scrubs dress in there.

154
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,969
So, you're what passes
as varsity around here?

155
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,937
Yeah.

156
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:03,740
Heh. Awesome.

157
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,463
Yo, skip,
toss me a ball.

158
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,500
Watch the ball.
Sticks up, sticks up.

159
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,102
Watch that throw.
Watch the ball!

160
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,070
Let's go!

161
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:36,773
Great, guys.
Keep the pace up.

162
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,609
Stay focused.
Really well done.

163
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,477
Good, keep
the ball moving.

164
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,849
Oh, you're late,
west coast.
It's 4:00.

165
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,185
If you're not early,
you're late.
You owe me a lap.

166
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,187
Let's go,
cradle it out.

167
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:52,388
Sticks up. Keep your
feet moving.

168
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:55,259
Nice. Nicely done.
Watch the ball.

169
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:57,160
Get the energy up.
Sticks up.

170
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,595
You okay?

171
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,166
Cradle it out.
Sticks up.

172
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:14,877
Sticks up! Sticks up!

173
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,280
(Overlapping shouts)

174
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,448
Come on,
you can take him!

175
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,986
(Grunting)

176
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:24,688
(Laughs)

177
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,589
You think you can
do better, Sullivan?

178
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:28,792
Only one way
to find out.

179
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,294
Switch up your Jersey
to white.

180
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,862
Coach,
give me a whistle.

181
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,264
You got it, coach.

182
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,765
(Blows whistle)

183
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,301
Braveheart, give me
Bryant! Let's go

184
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:40,237
(Overlapping shouts)

185
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:44,207
Bryant, Sullivan,
let's go!

186
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:48,912
Anytime today, Sullivan!
Here we go!

187
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,213
Joe's gonna crush you.

188
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,947
One-on-one,
go on my whistle.

189
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:55,252
First one to score wins.
It's that simple. Got it?

190
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,220
Down. Keep it clean.

191
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,090
Good luck, brother.
I'm not your brother.

192
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,025
Oh, we're all brothers
in lacrosse, west coast.

193
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:05,861
(Whistle blows)

194
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,068
Come on!
Come on, west coast!

195
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:14,370
(Grunting)

196
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:18,342
No, no, no, no!

197
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,009
Hey!

198
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,076
Yeah!

199
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:23,012
(Cheering)

200
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:28,352
You should've
shot when you
had the chance.

201
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,887
Yeah, I guess so.

202
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:33,357
Welcome to Briarfield,
Sullivan.

203
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,305
Conor.

204
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,373
Conor.

205
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,343
Hey, come on, wake up.

206
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,143
Dad? Is the house
on fire?

207
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,678
No, it's morning.

208
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,617
No, it isn't.

209
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,921
It's close enough.
Let's go.

210
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:12,928
(Laughing and grunting)

211
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:15,264
Not bad, not bad.

212
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,732
(Cell phone rings)

213
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,569
Hang on a sec.
I gotta take this call.

214
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:25,240
Sullivan.

215
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:26,942
Morning, general.

216
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:30,447
Yes, sir.

217
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,019
Right. Okay.

218
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:39,590
Thank you, sir.

219
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,995
What was that about?
Nothing.

220
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,365
Just some advisory work
they want me to do.

221
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:49,966
That it?
Yeah, that's it.

222
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't worry about it.

223
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,003
Let's go.

224
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:57,340
Okay.

225
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,310
Keep your arms
extended, this side.

226
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:02,178
Let's see
what you got. Go.

227
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:04,146
(Grunting)

228
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:05,948
Oh, nice, nice.

229
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,951
Except you gotta
learn how to shoot.

230
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,422
Who's gonna pick up
a guy who shoots
like a drunk woman?

231
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,022
Huh? Come on.

232
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:14,490
*

233
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,030
Brooklyn:
There are a bunch of ways
to find out about someone.

234
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:22,165
You can watch them
around other people,

235
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,468
Find out what
their interests are,

236
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,636
How they react
to new circumstances.

237
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,804
Sometimes, if you
really want to know,

238
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:31,206
It's easiest to just
talk to them yourself.

239
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:33,242
Hey.
Hey.

240
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,145
Hey yourself,
newbie.

241
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,613
Name's Conor Sullivan.

242
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,051
Brooklyn...

243
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:42,553
Milligan.

244
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,155
Ahem.

245
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:49,191
(Mutters)
Coach's daughter. Ahem.

246
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:50,793
(Laughs)

247
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,529
So, my dad says
you come out here

248
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:54,229
To practice
every day at 5 A.M.

249
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:55,765
Oh, does he?
He does.

250
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:59,369
Does that make you wonder
how your dad knows that?

251
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:01,070
Because it sure
makes me wonder.

252
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:02,439
(Laughs)

253
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:03,573
Hey, Joe, think fast!

254
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,108
Ha ha! Hey, babe.

255
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:07,577
Hey.

256
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,111
Hey, this is
my girlfriend Charlie.

257
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:10,380
Hey.
Hey.

258
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,047
Um...

259
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,116
We should probably
get back to practice.

260
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,418
Yeah.

261
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:17,521
See you later.
Bye.

262
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:20,122
See you later.
See you later.

263
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:25,228
Nothing's hotter than
chicks with sticks.

264
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:26,429
Nothing.

265
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:27,931
Just doesn't sound right.

266
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:29,600
I didn't mean it
that way.

267
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:32,735
(Overlapping shouts)

268
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:46,849
Gotta watch the pick!

269
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,818
Ohh.

270
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:52,088
(Grunts)

271
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,322
This kid can play.

272
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:54,890
He most definitely
can play.

273
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,027
So, what do you think?
You want to move him up?

274
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:58,929
We'll see where he is
in a week.

275
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
Hey.

276
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,805
Nice practice.
Thanks.

277
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:13,544
You're not
taking my spot.

278
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,444
Do you play
right-side attack?

279
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:16,946
Damn straight.

280
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:20,950
Then I'm definitely
taking your spot.

281
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:24,887
Let it go.

282
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:32,728
(Chuckles) Ahh.

283
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,867
(Knock on door)

284
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,604
You wanted to see me?

285
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:47,277
Yeah, take a seat.

286
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:50,479
So, uh, you've been
practicing with us...

287
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,616
For, what,
about a week now?

288
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:55,317
What do you think?

289
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,419
Uh...

290
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:00,023
Well, I think you've
got a good system
going on...

291
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,257
Thanks, kid,
but I don't need you
to kiss my butt.

292
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm asking if you can
play with them.

293
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:06,429
Not a one-man dance
out there,

294
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:09,099
But actually working
with them as a unit.

295
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:11,501
I thought you weren't
gonna play me.

296
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,235
Well, that may change.

297
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:14,905
May?
May.

298
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,505
You're not the God's gift
you think you are,

299
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:17,973
But you're better
than I expected.

300
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,546
Yes... I can play
with them.

301
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,281
Good. You'll suit up
on Friday.

302
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:28,317
It's our last game
before the playoffs.

303
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:31,353
Impress me.

304
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,591
(Overlapping shouts)

305
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:37,661
Why isn't he
playing Conor?

306
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:39,428
Relax, he knows
what he's doing.

307
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,931
I don't think Dave's
gonna give him a fair shot.

308
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:45,568
You know
us Sullivans, huh?

309
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,369
We always a way
to get it done.

310
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:49,172
(Laughs)

311
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,707
Move your feet!

312
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:53,576
Let's have some
pressure, defense!

313
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,382
All right, Dupree out!

314
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,551
Sullivan!

315
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,955
Eh-eh.

316
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,657
Remember what
I told you?

317
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:10,060
You got it?
Got it, coach.

318
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,328
Dad: Okay,
here we go.

319
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,929
It's about time.

320
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,832
He just wanted to show
Conor who's boss.

321
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,566
You think that taught
Conor anything?

322
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:18,769
Heh! Doubt it.

323
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,772
(Shouting)

324
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,882
Let's go, baby!
Nice goin'!

325
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:35,786
You gotta get your body
between the ball
and the goal, son.

326
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,519
What is this,
girls' volleyball?

327
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:38,854
(Cell phone ringing)

328
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:41,523
Good scrimmage!
First team, come off!

329
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,259
I'll be right back.

330
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,594
Dave: Nice job,
first team, good work.

331
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:48,832
Good work today. Nice.

332
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:53,068
Good effort.
Let's go, second team!

333
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,604
Let's see some pressure,
let's hear some talk!

334
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,640
That's what I'm talk...
come on, let's hear
some talk!

335
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:00,276
(Shouting)

336
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,611
Come on, let's go!
Keep it moving!

337
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,347
Keep that ball high!

338
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:06,415
(Shouting continues)

339
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:16,727
(Whistle blows)

340
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,394
End of the day.
Hit the showers.

341
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,629
Good work today.

342
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:23,166
Good work today,
everybody.

343
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,777
You didn't
have to wait.

344
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,545
Well, I think
we should talk.

345
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,681
All right.

346
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:45,822
So, who was that
on the phone?

347
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,729
They need me
back in Iraq.

348
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:57,566
Well,
mom needs you here.

349
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,869
So does Keegan.

350
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:04,074
Under six months.
That's it.

351
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,141
That's just
another surge.

352
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,377
We could've just
stayed in California.

353
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:10,345
At least then
I'd have some friends
to hang out with...

354
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:16,086
I know it wasn't
part of the plan.

355
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:19,488
Then this is where
you need to be.

356
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,457
This is your future.

357
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:24,460
Six months.

358
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:30,532
Come on.

359
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,369
*

360
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:46,249
Conor?

361
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:48,583
I've got something
for you.

362
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,718
What is it?

363
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:51,686
A box of roses.

364
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:54,156
Just open it.

365
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,363
That's what you said
they called you, right?

366
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,265
Captain America?

367
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:07,237
Hope you score
a lot of goals
with that, son.

368
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:10,273
But it's important
how you score.

369
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,542
Never put yourself
above the game.

370
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,614
Now, give your
old man a hug.

371
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:21,784
Come on.

372
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:31,660
I'll have my
right hand shot down
when you get back.

373
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,528
Can't wait.

374
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:37,199
Keep your head down
over there.

375
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:40,035
You just keep your
head up over here.

376
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:23,213
(Alarm ringing)

377
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:39,294
*

378
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,519
He's here.

379
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:12,527
You're late,
west coast.

380
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:15,597
Late to my own practice
that you're intruding on.

381
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:16,967
Intruding, huh?

382
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:18,901
We could leave.

383
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:21,870
You can stay.

384
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:24,539
My work here is done.

385
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,778
At least try
to play hard-to-get.

386
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:30,446
Shut up.

387
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,750
You ready?

388
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:38,588
Let's do it.

389
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:39,956
(Grunting)

390
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,568
You okay?

391
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:56,171
Yeah. Fine.

392
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,417
I can't shoot
with this thing.

393
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:09,651
Shooting strings
are a mess.

394
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:12,022
Ahh.

395
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:15,058
Much better.

396
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,659
Maybe if you didn't
shoot so hard.

397
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,670
I heard
about your dad.

398
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:31,806
Yeah?

399
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:33,942
How long
is he gone for?

400
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,612
Six months.
Hmm.

401
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,684
(Car horn honks)

402
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,123
(Sighs)

403
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:53,462
Same time tomorrow?

404
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:57,799
Well, I'd hate
to intrude.

405
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,269
(Chuckles)

406
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:05,641
Uhh!

407
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:08,978
Morning.

408
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:12,147
(Sighs)

409
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:14,016
It's fine.

410
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,052
When your daughter
leaves the house
before dawn,

411
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,652
It's not spying,
it's parenting.

412
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,987
(Scoffs)

413
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:20,455
I'm not sure
it's a good idea

414
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,157
To hang around
that Sullivan kid,
though.

415
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:25,794
Dad, I barely
even know him.

416
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,297
Right.

417
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,969
Everybody gather up!

418
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:37,005
Whole team, gather!
Let's go!

419
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:39,809
Everyone, bring it in!

420
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,311
I've just been informed

421
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,246
That Briarfield has been
selected as the location

422
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:47,183
For the first ever east-west
championship game.

423
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,684
Gentlemen,
it is my intention

424
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,720
That we're not only
hosting that game,

425
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,787
But we're playing in it.

426
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:55,890
Hands in, men.
Warriors on three.

427
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:57,059
(Cheering)

428
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,060
One, two, three.

429
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,495
All: Warriors!

430
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:01,963
Let's go out
and show 'em who we are!

431
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:04,434
Come on!

432
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:09,271
(Overlapping shouts)

433
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:26,221
(Whistle blows)

434
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:31,161
Sullivan, get in there
for Dupree.

435
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:37,233
Uhh!
Uhh!

436
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,405
(Overlapping shouts)

437
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,323
Bounce back up.
Let's go.

438
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,994
(Whistle blows)

439
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,096
We got number 9...
unsportsmanlike
conduct.

440
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:08,531
Two minutes.

441
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,766
That was a stupid play.

442
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,171
He pushed me,
I pushed back.

443
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:17,807
Come on Briarfield!
Man down!

444
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,642
Let's go!

445
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:24,647
(Indistinct shouts)

446
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:53,943
Nice game, Conor.

447
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,278
Except for the penalty.

448
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:57,011
Dad would've been proud.

449
00:27:57,078 --> 00:27:58,180
Thanks, mom.

450
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,615
There's some mail
for you.

451
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:06,088
(Laughs)
What is it?

452
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:11,694
Dad signed me up
for some old-school
lacrosse camp.

453
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,696
Looks good,
doesn't it?

454
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:16,366
Run by native American
players.

455
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:19,269
Your dad used to
love it up there.

456
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,043
"Ha ha, dad.
Indian lacrosse camp.

457
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,847
Hooray east coast."

458
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,722
Your dad knows
how to text?

459
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:42,624
Uh, yeah.
He said he made
his private show him.

460
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,270
(Coughs)

461
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:57,239
* then we went up

462
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:59,308
* we are much older

463
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,411
* you wait like an angel

464
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:05,080
* and I pine
like a soldier *

465
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:08,150
* but I remember love

466
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:11,754
* love don't remember me

467
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,392
* it's been a long

468
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:20,228
* long time

469
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:23,164
* since I've been on

470
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:26,167
* your mind

471
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,403
* but I cannot

472
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,239
* decline

473
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:34,276
* anything for you

474
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:40,483
* I'll drink the whiskey

475
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,453
* you'll drink
gin and tonic *

476
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:46,288
* you got
much more strong *

477
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:48,690
* I got more neurotic

478
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:51,494
* but I remember love

479
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:55,530
* but love
don't remember me *

480
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:25,395
* now that I've been
replaced *

481
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,500
* I have the guts
to face *

482
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:33,668
(Lyrics indistinct)

483
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,340
Mother: Thank you
for coming.

484
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:41,977
Is it cold in here?

485
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:45,615
(Indistinct chatter)

486
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,758
Hey. With all
due respect, son,

487
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,360
I think your mom
needs you here.

488
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,431
I can't stay.
I just can't.

489
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:04,032
A warrior doesn't
run from pain.

490
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:07,301
Do the right thing
by your family

491
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,104
And stick around.

492
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:12,407
I'm sorry,
but I just really need
to get out of here.

493
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:22,452
(Indistinct chatter)

494
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:58,420
Hey, you mind
if I, um...

495
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,210
I'm...

496
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,579
I'm so...

497
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:35,124
It's okay.

498
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,159
I'm so sorry.

499
00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:45,501
I can't go back
in there right now.

500
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,475
Let's...

501
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:55,777
Let's get out of here.

502
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:58,480
Okay?

503
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,850
I'll drive.

504
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:04,186
Yeah.

505
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:07,723
(Grunting)

506
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,827
Arms extended.

507
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,647
Are you better?

508
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:33,716
A little.

509
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:39,521
As good as I can be.

510
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,498
Hey, Brookie.

511
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:53,035
Come on,
we gotta go.

512
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:56,004
(Sighs)

513
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,442
See you tomorrow?

514
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,012
You know the time.

515
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:21,363
I thought I asked you
to stay away from him.

516
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,632
What is your problem?

517
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,233
He just buried
his dad.

518
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:25,935
He's not real stable
right now.

519
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,604
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

520
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,013
*

521
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:10,680
Uhh!

522
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:12,447
What was that?
What?

523
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:14,382
What was that?

524
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:16,285
(Overlapping shouts)

525
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,722
Hey! Hey!

526
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:21,389
Settle down!
Settle down!

527
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,658
Dupree, you're done.
Back off, back off.

528
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,392
Sullivan, get out.

529
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,429
Go, go.

530
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:28,664
Get out of here.

531
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:30,064
Let's go, everybody
back to work.

532
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:32,366
Come on. Get back
to your stations.

533
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,336
Let's go.

534
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:47,115
Mom: Is this
about what happened?

535
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,151
Dave: Believe me,
it's not about that.

536
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:51,286
I have
a responsibility to...

537
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:53,988
Hello, Conor.

538
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:56,225
Coach.

539
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,660
I was just talking
with your mother

540
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,696
About whether
to let you play again.

541
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:06,868
It's been a month
since...

542
00:36:08,537 --> 00:36:10,740
I thought you'd be
a little less
hotheaded by now,

543
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,508
But after today, I...

544
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,309
I need this.

545
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:19,313
Otherwise, I can't play
at the naval academy.

546
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,785
I know. But I need you
to be a player,
not a liability.

547
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:24,253
I'm trying to get
this team

548
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:25,653
In the national
championship game.

549
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:27,489
We could use you.

550
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:28,823
But if you fight again,

551
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,327
That's it...
You are off my team.

552
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:35,930
So, what you're
saying is,

553
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,400
I have to let them
beat on me
and just take it?

554
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:41,035
If you want to come back
as a player, you're welcome.

555
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:43,437
Otherwise,
don't come back at all.

556
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,808
But what you're doing
out there now

557
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,343
Is not lacrosse.

558
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:52,347
Brooklyn: You think
you know someone.

559
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:54,548
You have
a nice connection.

560
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:56,786
But before they can
let you in,

561
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:58,353
They've got to
let themselves in.

562
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,090
They have to learn
their own heart.

563
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:03,457
Come on,
you're gonna be late.

564
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,828
Come on,
you said yourself
you needed to play.

565
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:08,662
Don't waste
this opportunity.

566
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,499
I'm not going.
You've been given
a second chance.

567
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,434
Just leave me alone.

568
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,636
Honey, I know
this is hard for you.

569
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,272
Do you?!

570
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,484
Come on.
You need to
suck it up, mom.

571
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:34,389
That's what this is?
You're sucking it up?

572
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:36,325
Since you've got
it all figured out,

573
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,192
Why don't you
step up and be a man?

574
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,228
Get yourself
to school on time.

575
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:42,096
Maybe you can spend
a little time
with Keegan.

576
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:44,665
Because you know what?
He's not sucking it up.

577
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:46,902
He's gotta learn.

578
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,819
Hey.

579
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:06,821
Hey.

580
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,690
Where were you
this morning?

581
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:10,892
I was up late.

582
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,427
Okay.

583
00:38:13,494 --> 00:38:16,697
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

584
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:22,736
What's the point?

585
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:24,939
You know your dad's
never liked me.

586
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:27,376
Doesn't even want you
around me.

587
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:29,311
Oh, come on.
We both know

588
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:31,981
My dad cares more
about winning the
championship game.

589
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:35,350
But it isn't enough
to be good, Conor.

590
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:38,820
Maybe if you were
more of a team player,

591
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:40,822
He would find a way
to use you.

592
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,258
Wow. So, you're
taking his side now?

593
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:46,095
Are you serious
right now?

594
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,331
I have been on your
side since day one.

595
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:53,167
Frankly,
I don't know what
your side is anymore.

596
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,485
(Whistle blows)

597
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:15,224
Sullivan, Douglas
is banged up.

598
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,027
Get in there.
Left side attack. Yes.

599
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:19,895
All right,
Briarfield, let's go!

600
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,695
Come on!

601
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:22,965
Hey, Sullivan!

602
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:25,066
How you liking
that left side?

603
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,675
(Whistle blows)

604
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:37,913
(Overlapping shouts)

605
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:54,563
Here, here, here!

606
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:57,599
Come on!
Come on!

607
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:58,900
(Shouting continues)

608
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:05,206
Ref, come on!

609
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:10,111
(Cheering)

610
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:23,824
Conor, no!

611
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:26,028
(Whistle blows)

612
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:27,628
You're done.
Get out of my sight.

613
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,011
You all right?

614
00:40:42,077 --> 00:40:45,147
(Indistinct chatter)

615
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:50,585
*

616
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:40,635
(Yells)

617
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,106
What is wrong with you?

618
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:46,740
Hey! Stop right there!

619
00:41:54,482 --> 00:41:58,153
(Sighs) Heck of a way
to start spring break.

620
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,788
Any idea who
might've done this?

621
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:04,992
Um, it all happened
so fast.

622
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,661
I didn't...

623
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:25,280
* in the light of the sun

624
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,683
* is there anyone?

625
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,256
* oh, it has begun

626
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:36,790
* oh, dear,
you look so lost... *

627
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,693
No.

628
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:42,831
* your eyes are red,
your tears are shed *

629
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,768
* this world you must
have crossed, you said *

630
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:49,171
* you don't know me

631
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:54,942
* and you don't even care

632
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:57,945
* oh, yeah

633
00:42:58,011 --> 00:42:59,080
* you said

634
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,184
* you don't know me

635
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,956
* and you don't
wear my chains *

636
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:10,791
* oh, yeah

637
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:16,730
Conor.

638
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,232
I'm going to bed.

639
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:20,602
You're not going
anywhere, Conor Sullivan.

640
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:23,638
* essential, yet appealed

641
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:28,843
* you carry
all your thoughts *

642
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,215
* across an open field

643
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:37,186
* where flowers gaze at you

644
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:41,723
* they're not the only ones

645
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,126
* who cry when they see you,
you said *

646
00:43:45,194 --> 00:43:48,061
* you don't know me

647
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:52,267
* and you don't even care

648
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:56,937
* no, no, no,

649
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:58,773
Sullivan!

650
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:03,111
He doesn't deserve
that name.

651
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:05,980
The kid has no idea.

652
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:08,249
You wear glasses?

653
00:44:08,316 --> 00:44:09,951
No.

654
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:11,252
Any prescription
medication

655
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:12,853
I need to know of?

656
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,255
What? No.

657
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:15,824
Do you have
a cell phone?

658
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,726
No.

659
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,829
From this point on,
you do not speak
unless spoken to.

660
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:23,130
Am I clear?

661
00:44:23,198 --> 00:44:25,033
You're coming with me.

662
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:27,801
Like hell I am.

663
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:31,572
Fine. Spend another
night in jail.

664
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Okay, okay.

665
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:39,248
So, where are we going?

666
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:40,949
The six nations
work camp.

667
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,784
It's where we send
all the reservation kids

668
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,819
Who can't get
their life together...

669
00:44:44,886 --> 00:44:46,855
Kids like you.

670
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,390
Work camp?

671
00:44:48,457 --> 00:45:13,314
Like picking up
litter and shit?

672
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,517
Get out.

673
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,195
(Both speak
native language)

674
00:45:28,263 --> 00:45:29,997
Court papers?

675
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,866
Didn't get that far.

676
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:36,237
Weapons?

677
00:45:37,406 --> 00:45:39,072
Drugs?

678
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,108
Pornography?

679
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:43,278
What? No.

680
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:48,883
I'm gonna frisk you
just the same.

681
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,585
And this will turn
into a court case
if you're lying.

682
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,289
Hands on the counter.

683
00:45:55,324 --> 00:45:57,190
Spread your feet.

684
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:59,260
And your cheeks.

685
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,370
Sit.

686
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:11,239
I'll grab
your counselor.

687
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:14,008
I am
his counselor.

688
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:15,543
Yeah?

689
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,780
Okay.

690
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:22,115
Missionary Ridge.

691
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:24,117
Think you can find
your way back in the dark?

692
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:25,919
Shitfaced and blind.

693
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:29,958
(Both speak
native language)

694
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,469
(Thunder)

695
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:42,235
Not that it matters,

696
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:46,841
But would you mind
explaining to me
this whole thing?

697
00:46:46,908 --> 00:46:50,143
Do not speak
unless spoken to.

698
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,813
Well,
where are we going?

699
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,416
What are we
supposed to eat?

700
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:05,493
You gotta be
kidding me.

701
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:12,866
(Thunder)

702
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,604
Jeez!

703
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:21,376
You need to build
a shelter

704
00:47:21,443 --> 00:47:24,145
If you plan on
getting some sleep.

705
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:25,447
It's impossible.

706
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:27,114
(Thunder)

707
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:31,486
Duke! Duke!

708
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:37,324
Duke!

709
00:47:37,392 --> 00:47:39,561
Duke!

710
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:43,432
* If heaven would
fall down from the sky *

711
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:46,667
* and I'd walk right in

712
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:50,203
* I wouldn't know
where to begin, no *

713
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:54,375
(Lyrics indistinct)

714
00:47:56,445 --> 00:47:59,080
* what did I ever do

715
00:47:59,147 --> 00:48:02,282
* to deserve
to be kicked out? *

716
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,385
* oh, oh

717
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:08,922
* can you remind me?

718
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:11,626
* or can we write
the songs... *

719
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:14,327
Who are you texting?

720
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:17,831
Joe?
Yeah.

721
00:48:17,899 --> 00:48:19,667
Any news
from your felon?

722
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,370
I can't stop
thinking about him.

723
00:48:23,438 --> 00:48:27,909
But how do you
know if someone's
right for you?

724
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:30,779
Obviously, I can't
ask my dad about Conor,

725
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:34,347
And my mom's been gone
for so long.

726
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:36,050
I just don't know.

727
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,553
I guess you just have
to trust yourself,

728
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,556
And if he's right
for you, you'll know it.

729
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,825
Mm-hmm.

730
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:58,973
(Coughs)

731
00:49:05,546 --> 00:49:07,916
(Coughs)

732
00:49:22,497 --> 00:49:24,699
(Coughs)

733
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:28,301
Hey, home slice.

734
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:31,606
How come you slept
out in the rain
last night?

735
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:33,007
I got a great
shelter here.

736
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:35,208
Why didn't you
come get me?

737
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:38,812
Is it noon yet?

738
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:41,983
I don't know.
Aren't you an Indian?

739
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,118
Can't you look up
at the sun or something?

740
00:49:46,187 --> 00:49:48,990
Well, it's gotta be
noon somewhere.

741
00:49:49,057 --> 00:49:51,458
Well, you'd better
get started.

742
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:53,794
Started on what?

743
00:49:55,428 --> 00:49:58,431
Knocking it down.

744
00:49:58,499 --> 00:49:59,500
Why would I want
to knock down

745
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,535
A perfectly good shed?

746
00:50:01,603 --> 00:50:03,204
Don't you live
in this place?

747
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,105
I've got my reasons.

748
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:08,175
I don't even know how
to use one of those.

749
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:13,915
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

750
00:50:13,982 --> 00:50:17,484
Which is
your chicken-choker?

751
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:20,054
My what?
Answer the question.

752
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:23,991
Are you really
asking me that?

753
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:27,128
You could've
killed me, man!

754
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:28,630
Lefty. Interesting.

755
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:31,199
One hand on the bottom,
one on the top.

756
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,702
Swing over
your shoulder,
extend your arms.

757
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:36,070
You get a lot more
power that way.

758
00:50:38,106 --> 00:50:40,575
This place is
a freakin' mansion.

759
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:42,577
How am I supposed
to knock it all down?

760
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:44,613
Board by board.

761
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:48,549
Board by
ever-loving board.

762
00:50:48,617 --> 00:50:50,918
Am ambidextrous.

763
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:53,254
*

764
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,631
* you feel like a candle

765
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:05,466
* in a hurricane

766
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:07,367
* just like a picture...

767
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:10,503
Be sure to extend
your arm.

768
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:13,141
* alone and helpless

769
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:14,708
* like you've lost
your fight *

770
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:17,544
* but you'll be all right

771
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:20,047
* you'll be all right

772
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:22,617
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

773
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:25,218
* you taste what
you're made of *

774
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:27,721
* you might bend
till you break *

775
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:30,692
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

776
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:32,727
* on your knees,
you look up *

777
00:51:32,794 --> 00:51:35,196
* decide you've
had enough *

778
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:37,766
* you get mad,
you get strong *

779
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:40,567
* wipe your hands,
shake it off *

780
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:42,970
* then you stand

781
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,709
* whoo, ooh

782
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:53,080
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

783
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:55,717
* you taste what
you're made of *

784
00:51:55,784 --> 00:51:58,252
* you might bend
till you break *

785
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,789
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

786
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:03,257
* on your knees,
you look up *

787
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:06,394
* decide you've
had enough... *

788
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,830
(Man screaming)

789
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:23,678
Get working.

790
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:30,451
I have blisters.

791
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:33,120
(Laughs)

792
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,906
There's gotta be
a purpose.

793
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:59,680
Crazy Indians got me
knocking down
a stupid shed

794
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,452
'cause it represents me
breaking myself down.

795
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:06,520
Yeah.

796
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:09,690
So stupid.

797
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:14,495
Why am I doing this?

798
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:17,732
You tell me.
You're the one
who screwed up.

799
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:21,168
When do I get
to go home?

800
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:22,836
When you learn
your lesson.

801
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:24,604
When's that
gonna be?

802
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:28,475
When I'm finished
knocking down your
palace here?

803
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,746
Kid, there's dozens of
buildings just like this

804
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:33,782
Waiting for you
and that sledgehammer.

805
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,084
What, Sully's
little boy

806
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,519
Want to come out here
and take a swing?

807
00:53:39,586 --> 00:53:40,889
Temper is good.

808
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,857
It's how you use it
that matters.

809
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:45,860
When you fight,
you quit. Right?

810
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:48,830
In life, in lacrosse...
You know you failed.

811
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:50,663
You know you're not
gonna win.

812
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:54,101
So, you throw a punch.
And you quit.

813
00:53:55,403 --> 00:53:59,407
Get back to work,
you little jerk-off.

814
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,980
(Squawking)

815
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,687
Is it 12:00 yet?

816
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:17,724
Crazy Indian.

817
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,893
Where's your sundial?

818
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,462
Save it.

819
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,833
You work,
I'll talk.

820
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:31,404
You know,
I'm a full-blooded
Iroquois.

821
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:35,276
This may sound
antiquated to you,

822
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:39,246
But the Iroquois
banded with five
other tribes

823
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:41,415
To form
the six nations...

824
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:43,818
A participatory
democracy

825
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:45,820
That lasts
to this day.

826
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:49,122
I have no idea what
any of that means.

827
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:52,994
A participatory
democracy

828
00:54:53,061 --> 00:54:56,297
Means that my people
got the vote

829
00:54:56,364 --> 00:54:59,400
100 years before
Thomas Jefferson

830
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:03,171
Decided all men
were created equal.

831
00:55:04,805 --> 00:55:06,440
So?

832
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:08,709
So, you couldn't be
more authentically

833
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:11,179
And originally American
than that.

834
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:16,550
So, the next time
you call me
a crazy Indian,

835
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:21,322
I will personally
tattoo those words
to your forehead.

836
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:29,363
Do I have to
remind you again?

837
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,867
Do not speak unless
you're spoken to!

838
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:35,536
I was talking
to myself.

839
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:37,204
What?

840
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,239
I'm pretty sure
this is illegal.

841
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:42,877
So is destroying
a trophy case.

842
00:55:44,711 --> 00:55:46,380
Now, work!

843
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:08,401
(Man shouting
in the distance)

844
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:16,009
(Shouting continues)

845
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:23,150
(Shouting)

846
00:56:42,702 --> 00:56:44,737
Heh.

847
00:56:44,804 --> 00:56:47,774
Permission to speak.

848
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,710
Define "warrior".

849
00:56:50,777 --> 00:56:54,714
Someone who spills blood
on the field of battle.

850
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,985
What about...
I know what
you're gonna say.

851
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:58,686
But don't waste
your breath asking.

852
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,622
Turf burns do not now
and never will count

853
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,257
As spilling blood.

854
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:06,427
I'm sure your dad
taught you all this.

855
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:10,030
My dad was never
really around
to teach me much.

856
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:13,700
Well, that's
too bad for you.

857
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:17,070
'Cause my colonel
was there for me
in a big way.

858
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:20,441
Let me tell you
a story.

859
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:24,911
I left the F.O.B.
In a re-supply convoy

860
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:27,448
To the other side
of Fallujah.

861
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:29,984
You know what
we were carrying?
Ammo?

862
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:31,718
Energy drinks.

863
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:34,055
Gatorade and red bull.

864
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:37,324
The bare necessities,
right?

865
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,361
Then, all of a sudden,
we come to a traffic jam.

866
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:47,535
Before I know it,
I'm hit.

867
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,936
And the corpsman
takes one in the head

868
00:57:50,004 --> 00:57:53,607
As he runs to save me.

869
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:56,744
And, I mean...

870
00:57:56,809 --> 00:57:58,411
We can't move.

871
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:01,748
All of a sudden,
we're surrounded.

872
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:03,684
End of story.

873
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:08,856
Then your dad just
comes out of nowhere,

874
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:11,359
Like the cavalry.

875
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:13,626
You know what
he says to me?

876
00:58:15,695 --> 00:58:17,697
"I'll never drink
another Gatorade

877
00:58:17,764 --> 00:58:19,500
As long as I live."

878
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:24,805
And somehow he gets
the medevac.

879
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:27,274
He gets me out.

880
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:33,647
He gets everybody out.

881
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:37,450
I never knew a warrior
better than him.

882
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:59,107
Duke: Well,
you're up early.

883
00:58:59,173 --> 00:59:01,241
Can't sleep.

884
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:03,744
I could swear
I'm hearing things.

885
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,978
Well, all right.

886
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:08,315
Let's go find them.

887
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:11,452
Find what?

888
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,154
The noises.

889
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:16,689
(Men shouting and whooping)

890
00:59:30,503 --> 00:59:32,106
Conor: So, that's
what I've been hearing?

891
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:34,142
(Shouting)

892
00:59:39,347 --> 00:59:41,615
Some of those guys
are the counselors

893
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:43,950
From the six nations
lacrosse camp

894
00:59:44,016 --> 00:59:45,186
Your dad signed
you up for.

895
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:47,188
They come down here

896
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:49,190
To play the counselors
from the work camp.

897
00:59:49,257 --> 00:59:51,292
Who are
the other players?

898
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,060
It's just them.
It's real lacrosse.

899
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:56,730
And, brother,
let me tell you... real.

900
00:59:56,797 --> 00:59:59,267
Your dad played here.

901
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:01,202
He was a counselor?

902
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:04,172
Just a camper.
Hand-picked...

903
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:07,741
For his love of
the game was pure.

904
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:17,285
(Overlapping shouts)

905
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:21,087
You know,
Milligan played at
this game, too.

906
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:23,590
You didn't know that,
did you?

907
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:26,927
He and your dad
played together at Navy
after that.

908
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:30,130
They were cool until
a woman came between them.

909
01:00:30,198 --> 01:00:32,499
Milligan fell hard
for her.

910
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:35,236
Your dad just
stole her away.

911
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:40,540
My mom?

912
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:44,778
My dad did that?
To a friend?

913
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:49,250
You know, every great man
has a weakness,

914
01:00:49,317 --> 01:00:52,885
And Sully's...
It was Claire.

915
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,791
I'm giving up
lacrosse.

916
01:00:57,858 --> 01:01:01,494
Why? Just because
your old man
wasn't a Saint?

917
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:05,299
You don't get it.

918
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:08,536
Every time
I pick up a stick,

919
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:12,104
Every time I hear
the word "lacrosse",

920
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,374
I think of my dad.

921
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:17,644
You know, if I could
say something...

922
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,582
Let him run
in your veins.

923
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:25,652
Let him
make you better.

924
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:30,323
He was proud of you.

925
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,494
Don't forget that.

926
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:44,338
Let's go.

927
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:48,342
(Shouts and laughter)

928
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:51,944
West coast.

929
01:01:53,347 --> 01:01:55,249
Duke,
how you doing, sir?

930
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:56,884
What are you
doing here?

931
01:01:56,949 --> 01:01:58,218
Spring break.

932
01:01:58,286 --> 01:02:00,220
This is where
I learned to play.

933
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,756
Briarfield made
the championship.

934
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:06,560
Good for you guys.
Thanks.

935
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:09,862
Come on,
be on my team.
Let's go.

936
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:17,305
Here we go! Go!

937
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,872
(Cheering)

938
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:26,379
All right, guys,
I found a couple more.

939
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:28,282
This game's faster.

940
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:30,216
Looks the same
to me.

941
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:33,620
Heh. Ready?
Game on!

942
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:35,956
Trash talk out here...
You lose a few teeth.

943
01:02:36,023 --> 01:02:38,292
(Overlapping shouts)

944
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:40,627
Ha ha ha!
You see that?

945
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:42,161
Were you watching
the roll dodge

946
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:43,764
Or were you watching
Joe getting burned?

947
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:45,231
I was watching Joe
get schooled.

948
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:48,035
Iron sharpens iron.

949
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,269
All right?

950
01:02:49,337 --> 01:02:51,638
Joe's getting awfully
sharp today.

951
01:02:54,206 --> 01:02:56,242
Two points down!

952
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,612
(Shouting continues)

953
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:07,054
Go! Go! Go!

954
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,925
(Shouting continues)

955
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:22,370
Go! Go!
Ha ha ha!

956
01:03:25,772 --> 01:03:27,608
Ha!
Yeah!

957
01:03:33,212 --> 01:03:36,048
(Shouting continues)

958
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,319
What the hell, man?

959
01:03:39,387 --> 01:03:40,821
Joe! Joe! Joe!

960
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:44,024
Come on, man!

961
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:47,027
(Shouting continues)

962
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:48,862
Here we go, here we go.

963
01:03:52,164 --> 01:03:53,666
Really?!

964
01:03:57,471 --> 01:04:00,172
(Grunting)
Get off me!

965
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,410
(Grunting)

966
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:17,157
Nighty night.

967
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:19,325
Let's go!

968
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,462
Play on. Here we go.

969
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:37,578
It's more than
a game, west coast.

970
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:41,081
When are you
gonna learn that?

971
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:03,302
Brooklyn: It's hard to say
if warriors are born

972
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:06,039
Or if they're made
by circumstances.

973
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:09,175
I know everyone faces
hardship in life.

974
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:11,879
It just seems like
some people

975
01:05:11,944 --> 01:05:14,748
Are actually
made stronger by it.

976
01:05:22,523 --> 01:05:24,992
Brooklyn:
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

977
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:27,995
Dad: Sometimes in life,
you just gotta
suck it up, son.

978
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,031
What you're doing
out there now
is not lacrosse.

979
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,366
When I was your age,
I could go for hours.

980
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,069
Conor:
Think I don't do that?

981
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:37,638
I never see it.

982
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:39,540
Brooklyn: What is
wrong with you?!

983
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,476
Mom: Why don't you
step up and be a man?

984
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,536
Hey.

985
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:11,070
This place is
starting to bore me.

986
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:13,172
Let's head back.

987
01:06:20,613 --> 01:06:24,617
So, I still
don't get it.

988
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:27,419
Was this supposed
to be a metaphor?

989
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:30,858
Was I knocking down
the walls of my anger?

990
01:06:30,923 --> 01:06:33,193
I mean, what was I
doing up there?

991
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,629
You think too much.

992
01:06:35,696 --> 01:06:38,165
It's a simple
question.

993
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:43,003
How do you feel
right now?

994
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:47,373
Pissed that you
kicked my butt.

995
01:06:47,439 --> 01:06:49,643
Other than that.

996
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:52,646
Honestly?

997
01:06:54,715 --> 01:06:56,382
Confused.

998
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:58,285
It's about time.

999
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,520
What?

1000
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,391
I spent a week...

1001
01:07:04,456 --> 01:07:07,459
Knocking down
a house...

1002
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:10,162
So I could feel
confused?

1003
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:14,434
You spent a week
knocking down a house

1004
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:16,604
So you could feel
at all.

1005
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:30,150
Look, you're
on your own now.

1006
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:32,018
I'm not gonna be
able to be there

1007
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:33,986
To rein in
that temper

1008
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:37,523
Or whisper words
of sweet wisdom
in your ear.

1009
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:40,327
You gotta
hold it together.

1010
01:07:40,392 --> 01:07:42,428
Can you do that?

1011
01:07:42,494 --> 01:07:45,364
Yeah. Sure.

1012
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:49,336
Well... That's
a resounding hoorah.

1013
01:07:49,401 --> 01:07:52,172
You know, if I was
a betting man...
which I am...

1014
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,506
I wouldn't put a single
George Washington

1015
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:55,942
On your self-importance.

1016
01:07:56,008 --> 01:07:59,511
Ahh...
that's just
the way I am.

1017
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:02,348
Now, your old man...

1018
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:05,051
He would've probably
done things differently.

1019
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:09,657
You asked me for the
definition of a warrior.

1020
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,860
A warrior
gets the job done.

1021
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:17,229
That's all I got.

1022
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:25,405
Now get out
of my truck.

1023
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:28,007
Yes, sir.

1024
01:08:33,512 --> 01:08:35,248
Hey, kid.

1025
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:40,019
For the record,
I'm rooting for you.

1026
01:08:41,655 --> 01:08:43,724
Thank you.

1027
01:08:46,525 --> 01:08:48,628
(Starts engine)

1028
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,609
Whoa. What's up, buddy?

1029
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:04,410
Man, you need
a shower.

1030
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:07,047
I try.

1031
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:10,984
Mom... Is it okay
if I go see Brooklyn?

1032
01:09:14,554 --> 01:09:16,123
Here.

1033
01:09:18,557 --> 01:09:20,292
Wish me luck.

1034
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:22,995
(Sighs)

1035
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,704
(Playing classical music)

1036
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,161
(Stops playing)

1037
01:09:56,696 --> 01:09:58,664
(Doorbell rings)

1038
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:00,367
(Resumes playing)

1039
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,738
Help you?

1040
01:10:04,804 --> 01:10:06,539
I'm here
to see Brooklyn.

1041
01:10:06,606 --> 01:10:08,208
I'm not so different
from you.

1042
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:09,876
You're never playing
for me again.

1043
01:10:09,943 --> 01:10:12,311
But I'll play.

1044
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:15,615
Anywhere there's
a couple of goals
and a field,

1045
01:10:15,682 --> 01:10:17,483
I can find a game.

1046
01:10:17,549 --> 01:10:19,252
I'm a lacrosse player.

1047
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:22,389
And that's one thing
no one can ever take
away from me.

1048
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,098
And, with all
due respect,

1049
01:10:31,163 --> 01:10:33,433
Tell Brooklyn
I stopped by.

1050
01:10:44,476 --> 01:10:46,112
Hey.

1051
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:54,888
*

1052
01:10:58,724 --> 01:11:00,760
Brooklyn: The heart's
a funny thing.

1053
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,265
It can break,
it can beat a little faster.

1054
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:08,500
But the most important thing
it can do is heal.

1055
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:10,270
And if you follow it,

1056
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,939
It'll lead you
where you need to go.

1057
01:11:42,668 --> 01:11:44,504
(Beeps)

1058
01:11:44,571 --> 01:11:46,806
*

1059
01:12:06,693 --> 01:12:08,595
(Beeping)

1060
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:10,563
Get up.

1061
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:14,500
(Laughs)
Where'd you come from?

1062
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:20,941
(Indistinct chatter)

1063
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:22,943
Oh.
(Laughs)

1064
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,611
I can do that, too.
Aah! Ha ha!

1065
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:26,947
Goal.

1066
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:28,680
That was cheating.

1067
01:12:28,747 --> 01:12:29,950
(Beeps)

1068
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,651
All right.

1069
01:12:31,718 --> 01:12:33,553
Oh!

1070
01:12:34,888 --> 01:12:37,689
(Indistinct chatter)

1071
01:12:37,756 --> 01:12:39,526
Here, take it. Oh!

1072
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:50,370
(Beeps)

1073
01:12:57,776 --> 01:13:00,013
(Laughs)

1074
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,085
* will you feel
anything at all? *

1075
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:09,989
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

1076
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:13,525
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

1077
01:13:13,592 --> 01:13:18,431
* will you feel better,
better, better? *

1078
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:22,569
* will you feel
anything at all? *

1079
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:24,836
* will you feel

1080
01:13:24,904 --> 01:13:26,473
(Beeps)

* will you feel
anything at all? *

1082
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:34,414
Joe: Good, Sullivan.

1083
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:39,052
Nice to see you,
east coast.

1084
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,054
Nice to be seen,
west coast.

1085
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:44,024
Performing
your penance?

1086
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,791
How'd you know
I was here?

1087
01:13:45,857 --> 01:13:48,160
Word gets out.

1088
01:13:49,728 --> 01:13:52,298
If you don't mind,

1089
01:13:52,364 --> 01:13:54,233
I invited some friends.

1090
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,902
Let's go, guys!

1091
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:59,039
Whoa!
There he is!

1092
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:00,839
The boys took
a little vote,

1093
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:03,943
And we decided
we could use your help
this next game.

1094
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:07,580
In case you didn't hear,
we're, uh...

1095
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:09,648
We're playing
your old school
for the championship.

1096
01:14:09,715 --> 01:14:11,050
Thanks, Dupree.

1097
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:13,085
I won't let
you guys down.

1098
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:15,221
What's up, boys?

1099
01:14:17,524 --> 01:14:20,592
Let's go, guys.
Let's throw some
balls around, huh?

1100
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:22,695
Brooklyn: The beauty
of finding yourself

1101
01:14:22,762 --> 01:14:25,297
And really knowing
who you are

1102
01:14:25,364 --> 01:14:27,534
Is that it allows
the possibility

1103
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:30,703
For others to be a part
of your world as well.

1104
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,940
Hey.

1105
01:14:35,008 --> 01:14:36,976
Heh.

1106
01:14:40,846 --> 01:14:42,682
* do you

1107
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:44,783
* want to get to

1108
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,486
* know me?

1109
01:14:46,553 --> 01:14:50,856
* every little thing that

1110
01:14:50,922 --> 01:14:54,261
* makes me me

1111
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:59,365
* if you want
the best I've got *

1112
01:14:59,431 --> 01:15:03,203
* it'll cost you
a little honesty *

1113
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:08,508
* take a deep breath

1114
01:15:08,575 --> 01:15:11,878
* and tell me what
you're feeling... *

1115
01:15:11,943 --> 01:15:14,414
(Sighs)

1116
01:15:20,919 --> 01:15:23,289
Hey.
Hey.

1117
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,438
What the hell is this?

1118
01:15:42,742 --> 01:15:43,975
We need west coast.

1119
01:15:44,043 --> 01:15:45,712
Out of the question.

1120
01:15:47,147 --> 01:15:50,117
We aren't asking,
coach.

1121
01:15:53,885 --> 01:15:55,387
This isn't a democracy.

1122
01:15:55,454 --> 01:15:58,725
He knows Sierra
better than any of us.

1123
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:02,394
Come on, you guys.
Get back to class.

1124
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:07,700
Brooklyn?

1125
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:10,137
You need to find
a way, coach.

1126
01:16:10,202 --> 01:16:12,204
This is a team issue,
Brookie.

1127
01:16:12,271 --> 01:16:14,706
No. No,
it's personal, daddy.

1128
01:16:14,773 --> 01:16:16,576
So find a way.

1129
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:19,545
Either Conor plays,
or none of us play.

1130
01:16:19,612 --> 01:16:21,913
There's a national
title on the line.
We're a team.

1131
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,650
Remember?

1132
01:16:23,715 --> 01:16:25,784
Sullivan's a good kid,
and he's been
through a lot,

1133
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:27,286
But he's not up to this.

1134
01:16:27,353 --> 01:16:29,822
And he'll take you all
down with him.

1135
01:16:31,324 --> 01:16:33,726
Then we all go down
together.

1136
01:16:35,195 --> 01:16:37,364
Big game today, dad.

1137
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:42,735
I'm sure you'd have something
inspirational to say.

1138
01:16:46,838 --> 01:16:48,808
Well, guess what?

1139
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,144
I met a girl.

1140
01:16:51,211 --> 01:16:53,479
She's beautiful, dad.

1141
01:16:55,148 --> 01:16:57,849
And the best part is...

1142
01:16:57,916 --> 01:17:00,486
She's Milligan's daughter.

1143
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:03,555
I'm sure you got
a kick out of that.

1144
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:09,362
You should see
my right-handed shot.

1145
01:17:13,299 --> 01:17:15,535
I miss you, dad.

1146
01:17:21,174 --> 01:17:23,108
I'm gonna get it done.

1147
01:17:23,176 --> 01:17:25,212
I promise you.

1148
01:17:27,045 --> 01:17:29,481
(Cheering)

1149
01:17:31,049 --> 01:17:33,385
(Overlapping shouts)

1150
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:37,757
Look sharp,
west coast.

1151
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:40,360
Respect the game,
east coast.

1152
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:46,031
You ready
to win this?

1153
01:17:46,097 --> 01:17:47,899
How cute is he?

1154
01:17:47,966 --> 01:17:49,702
He looks
like his father.

1155
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,706
(Whistle blows)

1156
01:17:53,773 --> 01:17:57,176
Let's go!
Sideline, everybody!

1157
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:01,180
Gather up, gentlemen.

1158
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,715
This is it.

1159
01:18:03,783 --> 01:18:06,052
The national championship
is on the line.

1160
01:18:06,117 --> 01:18:08,153
It's yours to win.

1161
01:18:08,221 --> 01:18:10,990
Hands in, gentlemen.
Do or die.

1162
01:18:11,057 --> 01:18:13,059
"Warriors" on three.

1163
01:18:13,124 --> 01:18:14,160
One, two, three!

1164
01:18:14,226 --> 01:18:16,062
All: Warriors!

1165
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:19,866
Let's go, baby!

1166
01:18:19,932 --> 01:18:22,269
To the national high school
lacrosse championship,

1167
01:18:22,334 --> 01:18:24,704
Courtesy of lacrosse-x.Com.

1168
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:27,206
This will be the first ever
national high school
lacrosse championship,

1169
01:18:27,274 --> 01:18:30,710
Featuring the best
of the east...
the Briarfield warriors...

1170
01:18:30,777 --> 01:18:33,380
Versus the best of the west...
The Sierra lions.

1171
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:35,315
Shake hands.

1172
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,182
The captains shake
as we get ready

1173
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,387
For the national championship
high school match-up.

1174
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:45,292
Dude. Midfield,
new team.

1175
01:18:45,358 --> 01:18:47,294
Fresh start,
green hornet.

1176
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,296
What's Riggins
doing here?

1177
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:51,230
Late-season transfer.

1178
01:18:51,298 --> 01:18:53,198
How sweet is that?

1179
01:18:53,266 --> 01:18:55,100
You hear me, Sullivan?

1180
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,635
Did you say
something?

1181
01:18:56,702 --> 01:18:58,203
Both teams at midfield
as we get underway.

1182
01:18:58,271 --> 01:18:59,739
We'll have a chance to see

1183
01:18:59,806 --> 01:19:01,240
If west coast lacrosse
is ready

1184
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,008
For the national stage,

1185
01:19:03,075 --> 01:19:04,744
And whether they can overcome
the transfer

1186
01:19:04,811 --> 01:19:06,279
Of their former
star player...

1187
01:19:06,345 --> 01:19:18,223
Number 9, Conor Sullivan.

1188
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,225
All right, all right!

1189
01:19:20,293 --> 01:19:21,928
(Shouting continues)

1190
01:19:21,994 --> 01:19:23,330
Shot, and a goal!

1191
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:26,031
Briarfield goes
on the board first.

1192
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,770
Possession Sierra,
to number 14...

1193
01:19:30,837 --> 01:19:32,805
That's Riggins moving
the ball up the field.

1194
01:19:32,872 --> 01:19:35,908
Unchallenged
on the outside.

1195
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:38,311
And a nice save
by the Briarfield goalie,

1196
01:19:38,378 --> 01:19:40,780
And the ball's out
the other way.

1197
01:19:40,847 --> 01:19:42,782
These east coast teams
can move the ball well,

1198
01:19:42,849 --> 01:19:44,650
And Briarfield's "d"
is doing just that

1199
01:19:44,716 --> 01:19:46,251
With a diagonal
up the field.

1200
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:49,422
(Shouting continues)

1201
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:54,461
Go to 3!

1202
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:57,128
And a shot!
Goal, Briarfield.

1203
01:19:57,195 --> 01:19:58,465
Late in the second quarter,

1204
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,032
With a 3-1
Briarfield advantage.

1205
01:20:01,099 --> 01:20:02,669
Shot Sierra... score!

1206
01:20:02,735 --> 01:20:05,572
All right, good finish!

1207
01:20:07,206 --> 01:20:08,675
Let's do it!

1208
01:20:13,078 --> 01:20:14,113
Goal, Briarfield!

1209
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,448
Yes!

1210
01:20:20,353 --> 01:20:22,253
Number 9... Sullivan...

1211
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:24,190
Doing it all by himself.

1212
01:20:24,255 --> 01:20:26,525
Sullivan scores!

1213
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,563
This could be
a different game tonight

1214
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,964
If 9 were still wearing
the purple of Sierra.

1215
01:20:42,442 --> 01:20:44,611
(Shouting continues)

1216
01:20:46,045 --> 01:20:48,580
Sierra just needs one
to take the lead,

1217
01:20:48,647 --> 01:20:52,751
And the later in the game
we go, the more the momentum
seems to shift to Sierra.

1218
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,864
Oh, and a huge hit
by number 77!

1219
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:06,532
Next time,
take his head off!

1220
01:21:06,598 --> 01:21:08,534
And Sierra's gonna
have a shot here.

1221
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,536
We're under a minute,
tied at 9.

1222
01:21:10,603 --> 01:21:13,105
(Shouting continues)

1223
01:21:16,074 --> 01:21:19,811
Sierra working it around,
controlling the pace.

1224
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:23,249
They swing it back up top.

1225
01:21:23,314 --> 01:21:24,816
Riggins,
stick somebody!

1226
01:21:24,884 --> 01:21:27,719
They've got time
to set something up.

1227
01:21:30,355 --> 01:21:34,125
And a goal! Sierra has
scored the go-ahead goal!

1228
01:21:34,192 --> 01:21:37,564
Sierra has just silenced
this home crowd.

1229
01:21:37,629 --> 01:21:40,331
28 seconds.

1230
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:41,501
This is embarrassing.

1231
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:43,436
We gotta tie this up.

1232
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:46,038
What you got in mind?

1233
01:21:46,105 --> 01:21:47,440
You're captain America.

1234
01:21:47,507 --> 01:21:49,374
Nah, they know
my moves.

1235
01:21:49,442 --> 01:21:51,209
That's why we
gotta change it up.

1236
01:21:51,276 --> 01:21:52,579
Hey, offense, get in.

1237
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:54,547
Come on, guys.

1238
01:21:56,314 --> 01:21:58,485
Briarfield needs
a big play

1239
01:21:58,551 --> 01:22:00,052
If they hope
to pull this out.

1240
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:01,420
All: Break!

1241
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,523
Let's go, white!
Nice play, white!

1242
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:05,257
Come on, guys.

1243
01:22:05,323 --> 01:22:06,993
Come on, Briarfield!

1244
01:22:07,059 --> 01:22:10,095
Here we go.
National title on the line.

1245
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:11,463
10-9, advantage Sierra.

1246
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,399
Captain America!

1247
01:22:13,465 --> 01:22:16,936
Sullivan! Find Sullivan!

1248
01:22:17,003 --> 01:22:18,870
The ball's down.
The ball's up.

1249
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:21,474
Oh! Possession Briarfield!
That's Joe Bryant.

1250
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:23,842
The long stick is going
across midfield.

1251
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:25,410
He's looking to pass inside.

1252
01:22:25,478 --> 01:22:28,279
Finds Sullivan.

1253
01:22:28,346 --> 01:22:30,215
Sullivan with a great dodge.

1254
01:22:30,281 --> 01:22:32,584
He cuts to the middle,
looking for his big left.

1255
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:35,687
Needs a shot.
No, he dishes back!

1256
01:22:35,754 --> 01:22:39,424
Goal Briarfield!
There's no time on the clock.

1257
01:22:39,492 --> 01:22:41,027
But we are not done yet.

1258
01:22:41,093 --> 01:22:43,496
Hey, we've got overtime.
Don't get kicked out of this.

1259
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:45,430
You east coast guys, man.

1260
01:22:45,498 --> 01:22:48,000
Talk about overrated.

1261
01:22:48,067 --> 01:22:50,435
Did Riggins just
call me east coast?

1262
01:22:50,503 --> 01:22:52,539
You are, aren't you?

1263
01:22:52,605 --> 01:22:55,141
That's not captain America.

1264
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:57,076
It is over here.

1265
01:22:57,143 --> 01:22:59,011
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
by coaches' choice,

1266
01:22:59,078 --> 01:23:01,480
There will be no overtime.
We're still in there.

1267
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,584
The game will be decided
by braveheart.

1268
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:07,119
Why are we doing
braveheart?

1269
01:23:07,186 --> 01:23:08,920
Before the game,
the officials asked,

1270
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:10,589
"do you want to do
overtime or braveheart?"

1271
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:12,959
You agreed
without asking me?

1272
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,626
I didn't know
a west coast team
would be that good.

1273
01:23:14,693 --> 01:23:18,263
Let's go!
This is our game!

1274
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:20,567
All right, guys.
Settle down, it's not over.

1275
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:23,268
Come on, settle down.

1276
01:23:23,334 --> 01:23:28,206
Gentlemen, the game is gonna
be decided by braveheart.

1277
01:23:28,273 --> 01:23:29,508
Dupree, that's you.

1278
01:23:29,576 --> 01:23:31,643
Not me, coach.
Bryant's hurt.

1279
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:34,614
But Conor's not.

1280
01:23:37,448 --> 01:23:40,986
You know these guys
better than Dupree.
It has to be you.

1281
01:23:41,053 --> 01:23:42,622
Sullivan,
you up for this?

1282
01:23:45,725 --> 01:23:48,160
Okay, we know Sullivan's
looking for a fight.

1283
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:50,630
Find it for him.
Hit him, and hit him hard.

1284
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:53,065
Sooner or later,
he'll lose it.

1285
01:23:55,568 --> 01:23:57,836
All right, let's do it.

1286
01:24:01,107 --> 01:24:04,075
Let's do it!
Let's go! Let's go!

1287
01:24:04,143 --> 01:24:05,644
The nets will be brought
to center field.

1288
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:07,379
This is sudden death.

1289
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:09,315
No time on the clock,
no time outs.

1290
01:24:09,381 --> 01:24:12,952
Simple rules. The first
to score wins the game.

1291
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:23,528
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join us on the field
for braveheart.

1292
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,196
Oh, I can't take this.

1293
01:24:25,263 --> 01:24:28,266
We have to go.
(Laughs)

1294
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:32,071
Braveheart may be
a new development
for organized lacrosse,

1295
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:34,573
But its pedigree comes straight
out of the sport's history

1296
01:24:34,641 --> 01:24:37,276
As a true test
of a warrior.

1297
01:24:37,343 --> 01:24:39,578
No rest, nowhere to hide...

1298
01:24:39,646 --> 01:24:41,479
Just man-on-man
sudden death.

1299
01:24:41,546 --> 01:24:45,584
Who has the heart to
battle it out to the finish?

1300
01:24:45,652 --> 01:24:47,620
Down.

1301
01:24:47,687 --> 01:24:50,421
Too bad your dad's
not here to see
you lose.

1302
01:24:50,488 --> 01:24:52,057
Don't worry.

1303
01:24:52,124 --> 01:24:54,661
There's more than enough
of him here.

1304
01:24:54,727 --> 01:24:56,494
(Whistle blows)

1305
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:58,731
Possession Riggins.

1306
01:24:58,798 --> 01:25:01,399
Driving Sullivan
up the field.

1307
01:25:01,466 --> 01:25:03,368
Left hand hold.

1308
01:25:03,435 --> 01:25:04,535
No clean opportunity.

1309
01:25:04,603 --> 01:25:06,438
Come on, Conor.

1310
01:25:06,505 --> 01:25:07,839
Fires. Blocked.

1311
01:25:07,906 --> 01:25:10,308
First chance for Sierra
comes up short.

1312
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:12,210
And now to Sullivan.

1313
01:25:12,277 --> 01:25:13,846
Come on, Sullivan.

1314
01:25:13,913 --> 01:25:17,816
Sullivan looks
for an opportunity.

1315
01:25:19,686 --> 01:25:22,053
And he's down. Riggins...

1316
01:25:22,121 --> 01:25:25,157
Going back the other way.
Sullivan holding ground.

1317
01:25:25,224 --> 01:25:26,993
Riggins lowers
his left shoulder,

1318
01:25:27,058 --> 01:25:28,760
Tries to spin.
No movement.

1319
01:25:28,827 --> 01:25:30,528
Sullivan denies.

1320
01:25:30,595 --> 01:25:32,563
You can take him.
Come on, Conor!

1321
01:25:32,631 --> 01:25:34,801
Come on, get him!

1322
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:38,304
Riggins fires
from the outside,

1323
01:25:38,369 --> 01:25:40,605
And shot blocked.
Easy save.

1324
01:25:40,673 --> 01:25:42,440
Back the other way.

1325
01:25:42,507 --> 01:25:44,375
Let's go, Sullivan.

1326
01:25:44,442 --> 01:25:46,477
Ohh!

1327
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:48,546
Riggins lays into him.

1328
01:25:48,613 --> 01:25:50,249
Get used to that,
Sullivan.

1329
01:25:50,316 --> 01:25:52,017
This contest
is a bit chippier

1330
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:53,853
As time goes on
and tempers flare.

1331
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,554
Sullivan looks fired up
by the contact.

1332
01:25:56,621 --> 01:25:58,123
Come on, come on!

1333
01:26:01,227 --> 01:26:03,561
Sullivan hunting
for the game-winner.

1334
01:26:03,629 --> 01:26:05,063
Working the right side now.

1335
01:26:05,131 --> 01:26:07,166
Come on!
Come on, Sullivan.

1336
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:09,701
Lining up for his big left.

1337
01:26:09,768 --> 01:26:12,004
Fires it!
A clutch save!

1338
01:26:12,071 --> 01:26:14,506
You can't let him
take that, Riggins!

1339
01:26:14,573 --> 01:26:17,943
(Shouting)

1340
01:26:18,009 --> 01:26:20,479
Riggins gets past Sullivan.
He's driving.

1341
01:26:20,546 --> 01:26:22,113
Take him down!

1342
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:24,050
Get him!

1343
01:26:24,115 --> 01:26:25,616
A shot!

1344
01:26:25,684 --> 01:26:27,353
Crowd: Ohh!

1345
01:26:27,419 --> 01:26:30,588
His stick got tangled up
in Sullivan's facemask.

1346
01:26:30,655 --> 01:26:34,625
The shot was wide,
but Briarfield may be
in trouble here anyway.

1347
01:26:34,693 --> 01:26:35,795
You all right, son?

1348
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:37,562
Dad: Conor...

1349
01:26:37,628 --> 01:26:39,298
Hope you score a lot
of goals tonight, son.

1350
01:26:39,365 --> 01:26:41,032
But it's important
how you score.

1351
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:43,202
Never put yourself
above the game.

1352
01:26:43,269 --> 01:26:45,371
Conor: I have to let them
beat on me and just take it?

1353
01:26:45,436 --> 01:26:47,473
Duke: Temper's good.
It's how you use it
that matters.

1354
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:50,209
Dave: If you fight again,
you are off my team.

1355
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:52,278
Dad: Promise me that
you'll show humility.

1356
01:26:52,344 --> 01:26:53,945
Duke: When you fight,
you quit.

1357
01:26:54,012 --> 01:26:55,381
It's more than
a game, west coast.

1358
01:26:55,446 --> 01:26:57,349
When are you
gonna learn that?

1359
01:26:57,416 --> 01:27:00,252
Duke: A warrior
doesn't run from pain.

1360
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:03,956
A warrior
gets the job done.

1361
01:27:09,027 --> 01:27:11,262
9, you okay?
If you can't continue,

1362
01:27:11,329 --> 01:27:13,132
I'm gonna have to
call a forfeit.

1363
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,036
Nah.

1364
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:20,571
We've got business.

1365
01:27:20,638 --> 01:27:21,873
All right,
play on!

1366
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:24,442
(Blows whistle)

1367
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:25,778
Come on, boy!

1368
01:27:25,845 --> 01:27:28,347
Sullivan attacks, powers.

1369
01:27:28,414 --> 01:27:29,916
Come on, Sullivan!

1370
01:27:29,982 --> 01:27:31,818
(Grunting)

1371
01:27:33,752 --> 01:27:35,153
Ride him, Sullivan!

1372
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,122
Push him out!
Push him out!

1373
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:39,724
Riggins giving nothing away.

1374
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:41,293
Come on, come on.
Take the shot!

1375
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,296
Sullivan spins,
he's got an opening.

1376
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:50,302
It's in! It's in!

1377
01:27:50,369 --> 01:27:53,439
Briarfield wins!
Briarfield wins!

1378
01:27:55,307 --> 01:27:58,277
The first national high school
lacrosse championship

1379
01:27:58,344 --> 01:28:01,280
Will go to the east coast
Briarfield warriors.

1380
01:28:01,347 --> 01:28:05,484
Thanks for being part of
a great championship game.

1381
01:28:35,381 --> 01:28:37,449
Congratulations
on the game, Conor.

1382
01:28:37,516 --> 01:28:40,920
Coach, thanks again
for the second chance.

1383
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:42,955
I could say
the same to you.

1384
01:28:44,622 --> 01:28:46,458
Great job.

1385
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,830
Good job, Conor.

1386
01:28:51,898 --> 01:28:54,065
Coach,
congratulations.

1387
01:28:54,132 --> 01:28:55,467
Thanks. You played
a hell of a game.

1388
01:28:55,534 --> 01:28:57,802
Impressive...
Captain America.

1389
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,906
Nice right-handed shot.

1390
01:28:59,972 --> 01:29:03,342
Yeah? Well, now I'm
ambidextrous, too.

1391
01:29:03,409 --> 01:29:05,544
Way to go.
Your boys played well.

1392
01:29:08,614 --> 01:29:09,748
Thank you, honey.

1393
01:29:09,814 --> 01:29:12,483
Congratulations.

1394
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:16,121
Go ahead.

1395
01:29:17,723 --> 01:29:18,789
You heading back?

1396
01:29:18,857 --> 01:29:21,928
Unfinished business.

1397
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:23,595
Sergeant major.

1398
01:29:23,662 --> 01:29:25,796
Hey.

1399
01:29:25,864 --> 01:29:27,433
I gotta ask you...

1400
01:29:27,498 --> 01:29:29,868
Hammering down
the house...

1401
01:29:29,936 --> 01:29:32,404
Metaphor or not?

1402
01:29:34,805 --> 01:29:37,608
Hey. Are you okay?

1403
01:29:37,675 --> 01:29:39,011
Yeah.

1404
01:29:39,078 --> 01:29:42,613
Well done, honey.
Thanks, mom.

1405
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,984
Hey, Sullivan.

1406
01:29:45,051 --> 01:29:46,518
You got a minute?

1407
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,321
With all due respect, sir,

1408
01:29:50,389 --> 01:29:52,857
I need a few minutes
with my family.

1409
01:29:52,925 --> 01:29:54,593
All right. Nice job.

1410
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:06,004
Brooklyn: It isn't easy
watching people you love
get hurt,

1411
01:30:06,071 --> 01:30:07,638
And it's impossible
to replace

1412
01:30:07,705 --> 01:30:09,507
Some things in life
that are lost.

1413
01:30:09,574 --> 01:30:11,509
But everything I look for
in a person...

1414
01:30:11,576 --> 01:30:14,012
Someone who stands up
when they're knocked down,

1415
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:15,914
Can work with a team,

1416
01:30:15,982 --> 01:30:18,249
And has strength
and humility...

1417
01:30:18,316 --> 01:30:20,351
Can be found
through this game.

1418
01:30:20,419 --> 01:30:23,155
Maybe that's why lacrosse...
Or baaga'adowe...

1419
01:30:23,222 --> 01:30:26,624
Is known by another
even older name...

1420
01:30:26,691 --> 01:30:28,160
The creator's game.

1421
01:30:28,227 --> 01:30:30,429
Native Americans
believe they play

1422
01:30:30,496 --> 01:30:32,563
For the pleasure
of their creator.

1423
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:36,635
Sometimes I think that's
why we do anything at all.

1424
01:30:39,938 --> 01:30:43,174
(Cheering)

1425
01:31:00,925 --> 01:31:03,494
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise

1426
01:31:03,562 --> 01:31:06,298
As we honor the memory
of lieutenant colonel
Sully Sullivan

1427
01:31:06,365 --> 01:31:09,101
With a missing man
formation.

1428
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,910
You do your dad
a great honor.

1429
01:31:19,978 --> 01:31:22,081
Respect the game.

1430
