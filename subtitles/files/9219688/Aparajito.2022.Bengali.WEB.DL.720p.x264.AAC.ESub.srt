1
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,921
'All India Radio.'

2
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:22,595
[playing on radio continue]

3
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,276
Please increase the sound, Vinku.

4
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:27,360
Okay?
- Yes.

5
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,881
'Now we start with 'Mukho-Mukhi.'.'

6
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,596
In All India Radio, Kolkata's

7
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:37,079
'Mukho-Mukhi' program,
- Keep quiet.

8
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,115
sitting with us,

9
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,245
is someone, whose first movie

10
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,213
took Bengali and Indian movie scene

11
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:51,014
to a permanent place
in the international movie scene.

12
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,918
With an apt name, 'Aparajito'.

13
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,540
Welcome, Aparajito Ray.

14
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,280
Greetings.

15
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:10,837
APARAJITO (THE INVINCIBLE)

16
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,633
Screenplay, Background music,

17
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:50,897
illustration, dressing,
while working on so many things,

18
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,916
why suddenly

19
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,608
you were excited to
make a film like this?

20
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:00,284
I was an avid movie watcher.

21
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:04,450
But I never thought
about making a film.

22
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:09,536
But the main attraction of seeing
a film was constantly increasing.

23
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,086
I still remember. In Kalaniketan,

24
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,880
I was working on the sketch
of Palash and Silk-cotton tree.

25
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:19,450
And at that time, Citizen
Kane had released in Kolkata Halls.

26
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,813
And it was just in
the theatre for seven days.

27
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,605
I couldn't see it.

28
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:28,098
Okay, sir?
- Try with lesser strokes.

29
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,078
Later I started with a fun exercise.

30
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:36,486
For example,
if I learned that a famous novel

31
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,670
is being turned into a film,

32
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,690
I used to draft

33
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,340
a skeleton screenplay from
that book before seeing the movie.

34
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:48,980
And while seeing the movie,
I used to match

35
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,610
what the director
thought and what I did.

36
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,356
You used to see movies,

37
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,738
but how did you
think of film society?

38
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,164
Well...
- Is dad inside the radio?

39
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,730
Basically,
we had the trend of watching

40
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,333
Hollywood movies.
- Quiet, quiet.

41
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:05,432
Sit quietly.

42
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,729
From various nations
like Russia, Japan...

43
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:09,890
And, of course,
the numerous countries of Europe,

44
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:14,149
amazing work was happening
there in the local languages.

45
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,793
And we were deprived
of seeing those works.

46
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,001
And few such like-minded friends

47
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:23,360
became increasingly
curious to see these works.

48
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,296
You can also call them Cinephiles.

49
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:32,307
Around that time I got hold of
a book called Film by Roger Manvell.

50
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,472
And it mentioned why
not make a film society?

51
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:38,026
And we all banded together to make

52
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:40,205
film society of Calcutta.

53
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,182
How long will it take?

54
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,843
We could have gone to Russia
and watched a movie and be back.

55
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,229
Just wait, Sir. The projector looks
like something from the Cold War.

56
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,277
If you had shown

57
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:55,306
this excitement and curiosity for
your studies instead of a bioscope.

58
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:58,370
My father is to be credited
for my interest toward films.

59
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,395
I don't need it.
- What?

60
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:00,300
Yes.

61
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,568
From my childhood, movies
were restricted in my household.

62
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:06,622
Going to a cinema was
like going to a bordello.

63
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,463
Thus, I was extremely curious.

64
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:11,278
We were only allowed
to see mythological films.

65
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:12,970
No adult films.

66
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:17,673
Even other mythological films
were not completely for kids.

67
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,095
The way Gods and
Goddesses were dressed...

68
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,110
Exactly.

69
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,965
And the divine dancers,
no less than cabaret singers.

70
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,248
This stigma related
with cinema is still there.

71
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:29,442
Trying to arrange a place to see
films has led us to this condition.

72
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,424
Either his house,
or his uncle's verandah...

73
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:36,210
And upon hearing the word film,
they try to kick us out.

74
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,730
A gentleman said.
Cinema? What are you saying, Sir?

75
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,875
Good people stay here
with their wives and families.

76
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,023
You're not really.

77
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,769
And then he looked at me and said...
listen, he looked at me and said.

78
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:46,636
Even you look like
you come from good family.

79
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,171
And that was the
day I was de-classed.

80
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,597
And these houses are surrounded
with so much ambient noise.

81
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,597
Reciting poems,
practicing songs, radio, news.

82
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:59,281
A great thing happened that day.

83
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,388
Along with the sound of
a church bell in a silent film,

84
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,887
nearby Kali temple's bells
sound was completely In Sync.

85
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,201
I am expecting Mr. Barin today,

86
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,950
who might give us a permanent
solution to our problem.

87
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,750
Not just a place,
we need so much more.

88
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,321
Shubho, why don't you tell

89
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,253
the story of prints of
the film Battleship Potemkin?

90
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,525
So I wrote a letter to
the British Film Institute.

91
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:21,600
To send a print of
the film battleship.

92
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,027
They were instantly ready
and the film came as well.

93
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,297
But we didn't know police
would accompany the film as well.

94
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:27,600
Police?
- Police?

95
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,914
Why was the police there?

96
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,170
Why else, they must have received
news from the postal department?

97
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,893
And that launched an interrogation.
What did you get from Russia?

98
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,410
What movie? Whose movie?
What is the subject of the film?

99
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,400
I don't blame the police.

100
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,357
Who knows if they heard of Einstein,

101
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:43,110
Eisenstein is completely
out of syllabus.

102
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,456
And hearing that the film
was based on naval mutiny,

103
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,910
they were completely shocked.

104
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,361
Yes. It took a lot to convince them
that this won't be shown publicly.

105
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,140
Before leaving,
they warned me multiple times, see,

106
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,800
we have strict orders.
Are you a communist?

107
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,283
Let's be careful, dear.

108
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,275
I hope seeing the movie
on October Revolution

109
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:02,724
doesn't lead us to prison.

110
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:05,261
Be careful.

111
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:07,315
Communist Party would
be banned any day.

112
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:08,198
Yes, done.

113
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:09,147
What?
- When?

114
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:10,812
What?
- Not a ban, the projector is ready.

115
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,595
Okay.
- Let's start, then?

116
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,645
I'll say let's wait a little,
Mr Barin should be very shortly.

117
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,220
He might be stuck
due to some protest.

118
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:20,821
There.
- The Devil is here.

119
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:22,281
See. Go.

120
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,280
Am I too late?
- No, please come.

121
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
We welcome you to this
mini auditorium of ours.

122
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,936
Every seat is a balcony seat.
- You're not late at all.

123
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,200
It was just news reel till now.

124
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,390
Okay. I hope
I don't need to introduce him anew.

125
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,692
Barin Bhowmick,
the encyclopaedia of global movies.

126
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,382
Nothing as such.

127
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,493
Watching Bioscope
is an addiction of mine,

128
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,090
obsessive compulsive disorder.

129
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,829
He's a Reputed member
of our Film society from today.

130
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:48,060
He is Chandragupta Kichlu all the
way from heaven on earth, Kashmir.

131
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,375
But he is a naturalized Bengali now,
an artist.

132
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,860
He has also worked as an
art director in the film industry,

133
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,168
but nothing noticeable, I assume.

134
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:57,820
He's the famous
Radhakanta Gupta, aka RK.

135
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,580
Aka Mr. Bantul, Bibliophile,
gastronome and the Kolkata antiquity.

136
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,820
That's enough. Everyone knows him.
He's a famous person.

137
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,886
And he's the man

138
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,076
behind the inception
of the Film Society of Calcutta,

139
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:09,540
Aparajito Ray, Apu.

140
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,811
Aparajito?
Son of Srikumar Rai, right?

141
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,412
Yes, his son.

142
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,990
He's the grandson of
Birendra Kishore Raychaudhuri.

143
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,440
And we are sure that he will carry
the legacy of his clan forward.

144
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:23,970
What do you think, Shivananda?
- Absolutely agreed.

145
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,050
I remember your name
because it is very unusual.

146
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,380
I have never heard
of this name before.

147
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,657
And I would also heard
of that famous height of yours.

148
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,779
Then listen to this Mr. Barin,
a friend of ours, a family man,

149
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,260
Mr. Kamaleshwar Majumdar,

150
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,184
has named him Orient Longman.

151
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,363
Even he's very interested
to make his film.

152
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:43,700
Really?
- And we also work together

153
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,310
in an advertising agency.

154
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:48,679
Good afternoon, sir.
- Afternoon. Apu?

155
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:51,907
Hey, Apu? How long?

156
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,990
Almost done.
- Okay.

157
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,700
We have client meeting at 4:00 PM.

158
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,030
Yes.
- You will have it.

159
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,144
Thank you, brother Munshi.
Thank you.

160
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,490
Always yesterday deadline.

161
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,155
Didn't you leave a little
bit more room for logo?

162
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,297
Client will create a problem.

163
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,009
I can.

164
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,870
But that will be an issue
for the main illustration.

165
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,136
Then we have body copy,
baseline, brand name.

166
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,010
There will be less space for these.

167
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:20,071
Wow, great!

168
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,226
Your calligraphy
is improving day by day.

169
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,438
Really?

170
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,730
It's all poetic knowledge,
Mr. Munshi.

171
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,007
Really?

172
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,434
What record is that?

173
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,033
I brought it for you.

174
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:36,679
I went to Free school
street last Sunday.

175
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,630
I suddenly found this while looking
around the vintage record shop.

176
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,989
Do listen to it.
- Oh, my!

177
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,216
This is Wagner's Daipin.

178
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:48,636
German Opera.

179
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:53,135
But I hope you know Wagner
was a devout anti-semitic.

180
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,530
Anti-semitic.

181
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,917
But brother Munshi,

182
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,870
do music and politics always...

183
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,586
Of course, there's a connection.

184
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,868
But you should listen to everything.

185
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:06,162
Mr Rai?
- What?

186
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,517
DD sir is calling for you.

187
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:09,323
Go.

188
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:10,514
Aparajito?
- Yes.

189
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:13,121
There's a very interesting job.

190
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,049
From Vignette,
I am releasing Bibhuti Mukherjee's

191
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,094
'Pather Padabali's' children edition.
- Okay.

192
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,886
I named it
'Taalpatar Banshi' (The Palm Flute)

193
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:25,713
Can you quickly make
the illustrations?

194
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:27,832
We don't have time.

195
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:29,983
I want to release the
book on first of 'Baisakh'.

196
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,743
And about the cover,

197
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,208
If you could think something
along the lines of the siblings

198
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:38,730
running through the Kans Forest.

199
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,364
Siblings? I...

200
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,288
What? Haven't you
read 'Pather Padabali'?

201
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:46,750
May I come in, sir?
- I couldn't, brother Dileep.

202
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,853
What?

203
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:52,700
The son of Sri Kumar Rai, grandson
of Birendra Kishore Raichaudhary,

204
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,340
and you haven't heard such an
amazing piece of Bengali literature?

205
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,490
Strange!

206
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,026
Brother Dileep, as you know,

207
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:02,302
cinema and music
are my choice of entertainment.

208
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,178
And among books I read
those detective novels.

209
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,114
That too, mainly in English.

210
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:10,060
It's not that I don't
read Bengali novels.

211
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,143
But I have recently
developed a new tendency.

212
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,850
Thank you.
- Welcome.

213
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,923
If I can't find film
worthy materials from a book,

214
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:19,782
then I lose interest.

215
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,566
Really?

216
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,730
Then you must read this book.

217
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,528
This can be made
into a very good film.

218
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:29,626
Film?

219
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,680
Yeah, your film.

220
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:36,623
Although, you don't like anything
other than the Hollywood types.

221
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:51,234
Do a thing, quickly read this novel.

222
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,313
This is a galley proof.

223
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,239
Pass the fire, please.
- Is it out?

224
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:00,230
See, the cover,

225
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,460
I won't let anyone else design this.

226
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:07,102
People do just the
book by its cover.

227
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,382
Brother Dileep, I want to say,

228
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:15,068
after reading this book,
I have to make the cover in a hurry.

229
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,616
Along with home, if I read
this in office, alongside work,

230
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:19,920
That's not a problem.

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,310
In an advertisement agency,
such moonlighting is not a crime.

232
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,690
And Brown knows the work.

233
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,297
The one who knows their work,
Brown doesn't meddle with them.

234
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,940
For example, your brother Munshi,

235
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:37,416
do you think Brown doesn't
know of his day-drinking?

236
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,176
If you had any native brown person,

237
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:44,350
it would have been chaos by now.

238
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:48,330
Fine, that solves it.
I'll start reading this then.

239
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:49,829
Get started.

240
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:02,441
Brother, move aside.
- Okay.

241
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:26,862
Apu, it's quite late. Go to bed.

242
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:36,348
Brother, here's your tea.

243
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:00,671
"TAAL PAATAR BANSHI"
(THE PALM LEAF FLUTE)

244
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:07,970
AFTER FEW YEARS

245
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,005
Books and books everywhere.

246
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,329
Are you reading this book again?
How many times will you read it?

247
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:26,940
You know, DD was right.

248
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:30,682
This book can be
made into a great film.

249
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:33,173
Will you make Bengali movie?

250
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,575
Why?
- Don't you remember?

251
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,072
You remember you went to a Bengali
movie with Uncle Lebu and declared,

252
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:39,900
no more Bengali movies?

253
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,672
Oh yes, we didn't get
tickets for the Tarzan movie

254
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:47,229
and went to see some
random Bengali movie.

255
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,750
And in the middle of the movie,
Uncle Lebu kept quipping.

256
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,262
Bogus. Bogus.

257
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,831
But that's quite long ago, Vinku.

258
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,414
Though you can't say Bengali movies
have changed a lot in the meanwhile.

259
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:02,321
Is that why you're listening

260
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,870
to Indian drupadi music
rather than Western classical?

261
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:09,126
If I'm to make this film,
I've to be familiar with the music.

262
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,801
Classical, folk, everything.

263
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:15,980
And DD asked me to be more Bengali.

264
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:21,369
But my weakness for this
high-class western music,

265
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,290
is hard to overcome.

266
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,240
What do you think?
- Right.

267
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,555
From Sonata in D-minor.

268
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:02,710
Fransesco Maria Veracini.

269
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,540
Give me your hand.

270
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:07,120
Live long, dear, live long.

271
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,132
You're...

272
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,381
deprived of this nectar.

273
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,270
Brother Munshi,
I'll take your leave.

274
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,930
Sure, you may go.

275
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,591
But do get some old

276
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:22,637
Western classical records for me.

277
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:24,890
I'll make you a list.

278
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,050
From where?

279
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,260
Why? From abroad.

280
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,166
Do you assume I don't know anything?

281
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,958
Oh, you are talking
about trip to London?

282
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:36,402
That's still in infancy.

283
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:40,410
No Mr. Ray, you can start planning.

284
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,813
I know it all, dear.

285
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:44,780
Five months of training,
and one month Europe tour.

286
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:48,751
Although whether you will train
them or be trained is to be seen.

287
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:49,926
That's a question.

288
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,933
Mr. Brown hasn't confirmed it yet.

289
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:56,848
But yes, if I get the chance,

290
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,112
I'll enjoy a lot of European
movies in those few months.

291
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,004
This I have decided.

292
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:06,633
Cinema fever has you in its grips.
- Sorry for the interruption.

293
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,998
Please come.
- No, I'm leaving.

294
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:12,430
It's evening for me too.

295
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,050
Do you need a lift?
- That would be good.

296
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,251
Okay, come.
- I'll leave, brother Munshi.

297
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,400
Sure.

298
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,432
Brown will give the official notice
in two or three days.

299
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:20,485
Let's see.

300
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:24,150
So you'll be soon selling to the
first city of the British Empire.

301
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,402
From the second?

302
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:27,380
Hey, Mr. Dutta?
- Hello.

303
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,047
Hello, how are you?
- Good. Greetings.

304
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,431
Greetings.

305
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,646
Didn't I tell you,
you'll go a long way?

306
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,021
I thought you meant
it metaphorically.

307
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,954
Hey...

308
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,440
Yes, sir. He's here, sir.

309
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,330
Mr. Ray, you may go in now.

310
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:46,989
Thank you.

311
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,340
Did you ask for me, Mr. Brown?

312
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,440
Yes, yes, I certainly did.
Come in, Aparajito, be seated.

313
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,518
Thank you, sir.

314
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:59,561
So, when is the treat, Mr. Ray?

315
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:00,501
Treat, sir?

316
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,240
Yes, of course.

317
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,099
This calls for nothing less than
dinner and drinks on your behest.

318
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,628
The head office has
given the final nod.

319
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,580
Congratulations.

320
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:12,094
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

321
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,480
Did you get your passport done?
- Yes, I did.

322
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:17,744
Excellent, now submit
your passport to Mr. Kutty,

323
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,004
for your Visa and
other paraphernalia.

324
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:22,149
Let's raise a toast
to your London visit.

325
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:24,206
At the club, this Friday, shall we?

326
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,366
Sure, sir.

327
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:29,088
Yes, of course...

328
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:30,724
Good evening, sir.
- I've asked in the office

329
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,688
to look for accommodation
near the Grand Central.

330
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:34,207
Probably easier,
if you commute that way.

331
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:35,223
Thank you, Sir.

332
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:37,728
Sir, this is your...
- Thank you.

333
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:40,081
Fresh lime soda, salted.

334
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,695
You can't be a teetotaller
in advertising,

335
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,540
that's nothing short of sacrimony.

336
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:45,991
Sir, ice?

337
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,262
Yes, please.

338
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,514
Just one.

339
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,381
Did you submit your VISA and papers?

340
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,088
I'll submit them next week.

341
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,559
Thank you.
- Welcome, sir.

342
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,670
It's your trip, Aparajas.

343
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,703
Oh, to be in London!

344
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,542
Cheers.
- Cheers.

345
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:18,137
What's all this?
What are these papers?

346
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,319
You need visa to go abroad.

347
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,037
Who knows, man?

348
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:26,107
You just got married.

349
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:29,150
And then you're going abroad
for five or six months?

350
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,600
And she would sit here,
sad and dejected.

351
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,820
I don't like this.

352
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:36,278
Mother, don't you
want me to go to London?

353
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,970
When did I say that?

354
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,430
Can't you ask your boss
that you want to take her along?

355
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,800
Is it so easy?

356
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,530
Do you know how costly
it is to go abroad?

357
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:48,195
And then staying there for
five or six months? And the food?

358
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,550
Would you have a place to live?

359
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:53,730
Vimala can stay there too.

360
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,718
Didn't you say you'll
have a higher salary there?

361
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,479
Just ask your higher officers
that only Vimala's travelling costs

362
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,309
would need to be incurred by them.

363
00:23:05,978 --> 00:23:07,756
Okay, I'll ask DD once.

364
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:10,487
But when I'll be making the film,

365
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:13,638
I'll make you the
production manager.

366
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,650
Prahlad?

367
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:22,080
This is from stone ages,
my first coat.

368
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,270
Hand me down.

369
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,565
That means,
my uber-companion Tweed Jacket,

370
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,417
and that cardigan sweater.

371
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:32,300
All the others are tight.
I'm thinking from Arlington,

372
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,840
I'll make a blazer.
- Hold on.

373
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,390
I've asked uncle Basu
to manage something.

374
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,923
Would you also need an overcoat?

375
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:40,160
Even if not now,
I'll need in two or three months.

376
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,488
During winters.
- We can see then.

377
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:44,417
You don't need to buy it right away.

378
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:48,330
What was mom telling you then?

379
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:50,976
To take me to London?

380
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:52,879
Oh, you heard it?

381
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,458
Mom's scared, I believe.

382
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,368
Her son is handsome,

383
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:00,387
if any foreigner traps him abroad...

384
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,240
Really?

385
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:05,410
Is mother scared
or her daughter-in-law?

386
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,590
Oh, please!
- Oh, please!

387
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,455
Thanks a lot for giving
me this backhanded compliment.

388
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,503
You do deserve a gift for that.
- What?

389
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,282
I'm thinking the matter
of taking you with me,

390
00:24:18,755 --> 00:24:20,105
I'll put it up to DD.

391
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:24,071
There's a possibility he might talk
with Mr. Brown and make it reality.

392
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,661
What?

393
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,255
I'm obliged.

394
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,120
Brown Sir sent it for you.
- Oh, thank you.

395
00:24:38,382 --> 00:24:39,893
There he is.

396
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:43,336
Mr. Aparajito,
I was looking for you.

397
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:47,455
The proposal you gave for
taking Vimala on a second honeymoon,

398
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:48,920
head-office has approved that.

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,871
Really?
- Yes.

400
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:51,578
Great.
- Confirmed.

401
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,631
Company will bear all the costs

402
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:55,292
of transportation, accommodation
and everything.

403
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:57,608
Thank you, brother Dileep.
How do I...

404
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:00,731
Don't belittle me by thanking me.

405
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,257
So I'll inform it
to Vimala and mother.

406
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,425
Right away.

407
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:07,990
It took us a total
of 16 days to reach London.

408
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:10,650
Good morning.

409
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:12,875
Good morning.
- Taxi?

410
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,695
Thank you.

411
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,832
'I joined work
as soon as I reached there.'

412
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,730
Hello.
- Morning. Good morning.

413
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,824
Hello. Good morning.
- Good morning.

414
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:27,391
'Our training was held in Primordial
London Office Conference Room.'

415
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:28,771
Yeah, absolutely.

416
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:30,659
'First day, after going
through the introductions,'

417
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,440
'we started studying.'
- Please be seated.

418
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,378
But brother Munshi's
words came true.

419
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:38,372
There wasn't a lot
of new new stuff to learn.

420
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:41,989
'Kinda like learning the alphabet
after learning sentence structure.'

421
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,626
'The things I was doing
for the last few years,'

422
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:47,425
'they were just revising that.'

423
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:49,320
This is in-part.

424
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,448
'Naturally, I was losing patience.'

425
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:53,456
'What's that? It's a body part.'

426
00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:56,273
'So I used my time in other things.'

427
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,710
'This, what catches
the attention of...'

428
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:05,332
I first saw a Television in London.

429
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:08,565
I also learned how to write
the script for TV commercials.

430
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:09,940
Hello.

431
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,433
Oh, there was another
important thing I learned.

432
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:13,919
Story-board.

433
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:16,167
Let's play and say it.

434
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:17,684
Hello biscuits.

435
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,950
'Later, that helped
me a lot to make films.'

436
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:27,519
'In fact, during 'Pather Padabali','

437
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,757
'I used to make story-boards
rather than short description.'

438
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:35,134
'And I would just
write the dialogues.'

439
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,741
'Sometimes, I would directly'

440
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,440
'underline the words
in the book with red ink.'

441
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,749
'Would be artist.'

442
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,908
Me and Vimala used
to travel a lot in London.

443
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:46,831
And we enjoyed a lot of films.

444
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:51,017
We had seen 99 firms
in those six months.

445
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,530
Look at that, Orion theatre.

446
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,872
What's running?
- Sunset Boulevard.

447
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:59,210
Oh, Billy Wilder?
- Yes.

448
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,442
But there's a day I'll never forget.

449
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:04,655
The day our landlord and his wife

450
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:07,310
took us to the film
'The bicycle rider'.

451
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,566
Okay.
- I know.

452
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:10,981
Oh, really?

453
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,511
This way, sir.

454
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:13,969
This row.
- Here?

455
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:15,835
Yeah, first row...
- Thank you.

456
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:19,675
We'll get the row...
- Yeah, I think...

457
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:21,593
I'll take it.
- One second. Yeah.

458
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:22,864
Come.

459
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:24,611
Yeah.
- There will be some time.

460
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:27,863
I guess.

461
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,935
Come, the film is about to begin.

462
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:35,820
Excited, right?
- A little.

463
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:41,753
Does it have subtitles?

464
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,712
I hope so.

465
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:54,599
While seeing the movie, I felt,

466
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,457
I was watching the right
film at the right time.

467
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:01,470
After the movie,
we went to Hyde Park for a walk.

468
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,724
There I told my companions
the things I want to do for my film,

469
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:07,924
Rossi did exactly that
for his movie.

470
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,920
And he succeeded.

471
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,944
The matter was so realistic.

472
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:14,363
This style is called neo-realism.

473
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,541
Thus, six months passed.

474
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:18,997
We climbed the ship
to come back to India.

475
00:28:23,072 --> 00:28:24,202
I had decided

476
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:27,293
I would draft the script of
'Pather Padabali' on the film.

477
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,610
What are you busy doing?

478
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:33,786
Oh, wow!

479
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,741
You would draw the entire
movie like comic script.

480
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:38,583
This is called story-board.

481
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:41,745
To make TV advertisements,
this helps a lot.

482
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:44,256
So your London training
is coming to use?

483
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,989
Yes, but the way

484
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:47,918
I learned to sketch

485
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:50,700
with minimal strokes from
the teachers at Kala Niketan,

486
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:52,549
that's proving to be
quite handy too.

487
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:55,156
And then you were
Mr. Khirat's favourite student.

488
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:59,353
I am reminded of someone else.
- Who?

489
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,518
Our Tollygunge government
school's drawing sir.

490
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,158
Mr. Bishu,
he's the one who taught me to draw.

491
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,080
Once he saw something I draw
and got really happy and said,

492
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:13,699
you are indomitable
both in your name and your work.

493
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:18,790
Do you plan to spend the whole day

494
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,762
in this locked room
with your sketches?

495
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:24,556
See,
the original text is so detailed,

496
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:28,161
I don't think
a script is very necessary.

497
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:29,692
But still,

498
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,186
I've underlined a few places,
and then I have my notes.

499
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,741
First, I am drafting
the story with this,

500
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:39,440
and then I will write the dialogues.
- Fine, that'll be done.

501
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,590
Come, let's go out,
see the sunset, it's so peaceful.

502
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,180
Go ahead, I'll be there.

503
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:55,685
"In this sky,"

504
00:29:56,063 --> 00:30:01,156
"the stars stayed hidden..."

505
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:09,141
"The things I had to say,"

506
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:14,657
"are now done!"

507
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:21,560
"In this sky,"

508
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:26,955
"the stars stayed hidden..."

509
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:34,482
"Maybe listening, you never did."

510
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:41,646
"And goodbye, you easily bid."

511
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:43,457
Why did you stop the song?

512
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,960
See, how dramatic the sky is.

513
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,860
Yeah, but the dramatic
scenes in my film,

514
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:54,915
one of them is Manik and Uma
going to see the train.

515
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:57,520
The earlier night,

516
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:00,941
they were discussing
to see the train,

517
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:03,491
but I am thinking,

518
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,339
if it came out of nowhere,
it feels forced.

519
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:11,759
It might not, how far is
the rail-line from their house?

520
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:13,090
Around...

521
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,113
Got it, Vinku.

522
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:20,805
Thank you. Thank you very much.
- For what?

523
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:22,269
Great, great!

524
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,860
Very impressive, I loved it.

525
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,260
But the most important
thing for making a film is...

526
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,600
What? Camera?

527
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,438
That can be arranged. We have Sunil.

528
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,810
Sunil is in catering service
in our film production.

529
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,330
He knows a lot of producers.

530
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,860
Wasn't there a producer,
Mr. Basu, or something?

531
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,722
What was his name...
Anyway, can't you get a hold of him?

532
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:44,110
I'd have to check,
but you know what?

533
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,426
It's not so easy
to manage that producer.

534
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:48,174
You'll ruin your shoes
running after him.

535
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,289
First, we need to make
a schedule using the script.

536
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:54,271
And then, make a budget.

537
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,879
Then Producer...

538
00:31:56,187 --> 00:31:57,640
That's a lot of hassle.

539
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,791
So brother Apu, your unit...

540
00:31:59,871 --> 00:32:03,904
Have you decided who
would be in your main team?

541
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,660
Yes, I have.

542
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,400
You'll handle the production.
- Okay.

543
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:12,956
Chandra,
he's the most experienced of us.

544
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,294
Chandra, see,
matching with the village backdrop,

545
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,287
we have to make the set in studio.

546
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,550
The difference between real
location and set shouldn't be clear.

547
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,100
Mr. Director, you have to
give me the time what I need.

548
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,460
And then see,
match the photos of real and fake

549
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,500
and see if you can get it.

550
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,702
I talked with few of
the industry's assistant directors.

551
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:36,483
They have a few conventional ideas

552
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,001
and they don't want
to step out-of-the-box.

553
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:41,838
Debashish, will you assist me?
- Who, me?

554
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,134
Yes?
- Me as assistant director?

555
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:46,413
What are you saying, brother Apu?
Can I do it?

556
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:47,896
You have seen so
much of world cinema.

557
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:50,278
You know film sense,
film form very well.

558
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:52,328
Don't you want to
apply that practically?

559
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:53,688
Don't worry.

560
00:32:53,768 --> 00:32:55,922
I hired an experienced
industrial assistant

561
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:57,548
to handle the technical side.

562
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:59,908
He can manage the schedule
and shot division,

563
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:02,472
Thankfully, I served
you chicken sandwich for lunch

564
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:04,168
while I was in Cramer.

565
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,907
Else, neither would I have met you,
nor would my luck be so good.

566
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:10,767
So the most important thing,
who would be the cameraman?

567
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,418
The people regularly working
in studios as camera men,

568
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:16,954
in this natural light,
without professional actors,

569
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:20,036
with no makeup,
and these experiments,

570
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:21,718
I don't think they'll agree.

571
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:25,578
I'm telling you,
they've very fixed ideas.

572
00:33:25,658 --> 00:33:27,903
And they are very much
resistant towards something new.

573
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,983
And then you are new.

574
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:31,627
They won't value you.

575
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:35,258
Yes, it's very difficult to unlearn
what you have been doing for years.

576
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:38,810
I talked with Nitai Ghosh.

577
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,098
Nitai?

578
00:33:41,408 --> 00:33:42,534
Oh, that...

579
00:33:42,614 --> 00:33:44,518
The director of 'Udbaasto' film,
he makes good films.

580
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:45,738
Yeah, the same.

581
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:49,775
Yes, I talked with him.
He's going away for a shooting.

582
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:51,259
And I was wondering

583
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:53,028
if we could take someone new.
- Who?

584
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,145
I saw someone as observer
in Jack Renoir's Ganges.

585
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:59,868
The name... you were there, you know.
- That...

586
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:02,318
Subir? The young guy? New one?

587
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:04,450
Young, very young,
much younger than he looks,

588
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,695
but very strong sense of aesthetics.

589
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:10,847
Due to office pressure, I couldn't
even see Mr. Renoir's shooting.

590
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,588
Later this guy told me everything
about the shooting in vivid details.

591
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:17,938
He's very sharp.

592
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:21,158
Apu, What are you saying?
This is your first film.

593
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:23,225
And you want a new guy for camera?

594
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:26,908
Don't you think new
cameraman would be too risky.

595
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:29,955
I thought I'll take him
as camera assistant first.

596
00:34:30,644 --> 00:34:32,620
I haven't even talked
with Sudheer yet.

597
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:34,558
Let's see. Let's see.

598
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:45,998
Hello?
- Hello, Subir?

599
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:47,778
This is brother Apu.

600
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:49,288
Yes, brother Apu?

601
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,338
I heard you're making a film.

602
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,508
So you heard the news?

603
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:54,638
Yes, absolutely.

604
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,515
I even know a little bit
about the people in your team.

605
00:34:57,758 --> 00:34:59,779
But you could have
thought about me as well.

606
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:02,128
As an assistant
cameraman or something.

607
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:05,012
I can't take you on
as assistant cameraman

608
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:07,048
as I have already
hired someone else.

609
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:08,510
He's quite competent.

610
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,698
Can I at least get the permission
to see the shooting?

611
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,238
As a camera apprentice.

612
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:18,358
No, I don't need
apprentice or anything.

613
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,532
Just directly come for the shooting

614
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,864
as a cameraman.

615
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:27,058
Are you joking?
- Absolutely not.

616
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:30,589
You are this film's lead cameraman.

617
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:32,971
Of course, only if you agree.

618
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:37,902
What? I have never
even touched a film camera.

619
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:39,968
You take still pictures, don't you?

620
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:41,954
And you take great pictures.

621
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,638
And compared
to the professional camera-man here,

622
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:48,973
your composition, sense
of light aesthetics are amazing.

623
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,978
The basics are the same, optics.

624
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:55,411
See, brother Apu,
I'm a still photographer.

625
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:56,929
The technical side...

626
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:58,865
I mean, there's a huge difference

627
00:35:58,945 --> 00:36:02,288
between still camera
and a movie camera.

628
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:05,272
I'll give you an experienced
assistant to help you

629
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:07,498
with all the technicalities.

630
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,998
And the only difference
between a still camera

631
00:36:10,078 --> 00:36:11,458
and a movie camera is that

632
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:13,577
in the movie came, the film moves.

633
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,577
This is a huge camera.
Can we take it outside?

634
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:18,148
Yes, you can.

635
00:36:18,528 --> 00:36:20,731
All we would need
are two extra attendant.

636
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,368
Subir,
won't a wall camera be better?

637
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,218
No, what are you saying?
This is good.

638
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:28,508
Who gives permissions to outsiders
to enter the shooting premises?

639
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,285
So I've been seeing these people

640
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:32,838
in the studio premises
for the last few days.

641
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,510
What is their intention?

642
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,428
They're making a revolutionary film.

643
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:40,581
And that neither has hero,
heroine nor love or romance.

644
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,305
Mad men!

645
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:46,918
Hey Sanjay? Isn't that Sunil?

646
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:49,258
Who?
- The one in grey Panjabi and Dhoti.

647
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:52,188
He has worked in the production
for few days with Bhupi.

648
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:53,521
Yes, right.

649
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,374
And who is that tall banyan tree?

650
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,876
So damn tall.

651
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:00,986
Is he a new hero?
- Oh, no.

652
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,270
He's their leader, the director.

653
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:05,478
Director? I haven't seen him before.

654
00:37:05,988 --> 00:37:08,248
Whose assistant?
- None's.

655
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:10,868
He hasn't assisted anyone.

656
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:13,987
A Foreigner came to make a movie.

657
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:16,628
He went around with him for a while.
He's Shrikumar Ray's son.

658
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,398
Shrikumar Ray?

659
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,220
From the silent era?
- No man.

660
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,138
The one who wrote
that weird poem book.

661
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:25,798
So he could write poems
why make bioscope?

662
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:28,142
No experience and all...
- To hell with your experience.

663
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:31,019
That fat man behind the camera.

664
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,858
He's never held a camera in
his life. Just think of the daring.

665
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:36,678
Not daring, stupidity.

666
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,670
Hey, Sunanda's coming here.

667
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,818
Move, move.
- Greetings.

668
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:43,289
Greetings, madam,
- Greetings, sister.

669
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:46,618
Brother Apu,
Sunanda sister, big heroine.

670
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:47,789
Madam's here.

671
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:49,928
Open the lock.

672
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:53,151
Action!
- This tree is blocking the light.

673
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:56,728
That side.

674
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,306
Greetings.

675
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:02,666
Good morning, madam.

676
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:08,548
See, Ms. Sunanda came, we wished
good morning, then greeted her.

677
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:10,283
And they didn't even pay attention.

678
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:12,978
Oh please,
they value themselves too high.

679
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,360
Stupid!
- Let's go.

680
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,621
It's all fine.

681
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,934
Ajit Sen said he
has a Solo wall camera.

682
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,773
He won't even take much,
you can test it.

683
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:27,917
As you can understand,
we don't have much.

684
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:30,016
Sunil,
you've to make the final budget now.

685
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:30,910
Yes, brother.

686
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,838
That's fine, but first
take writer's wife's permission.

687
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:35,865
See if she has any demands?

688
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:38,328
Yeah, I'm supposed to
go to Rama Devi tomorrow,

689
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:39,740
I talked with her on call.

690
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:42,078
Let's see.
- Okay.

691
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:45,328
See, I don't have the money
to pay you at the moment.

692
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:47,152
If the producer gives me the money,
I can do so.

693
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,008
If till then...

694
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,636
See dear many people
have talked with me.

695
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:55,620
There was someone just yesterday.

696
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,525
If I say yes,
they will send the money.

697
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:01,669
What was the name?
- Premanshu Sanyal.

698
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:05,358
The other producer, Mr. Ganguly.

699
00:39:05,438 --> 00:39:07,086
Mr Ganguly?
- Yes.

700
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,518
Alpana Movie?
- Yes.

701
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:13,698
What? I told him the story
and he is doing it on his own?

702
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:15,348
Dangerous, strange!

703
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:18,528
He said, he'll get Dev Kamal Basu
for the film.

704
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,113
See, we have went quite
ahead with the story.

705
00:39:23,516 --> 00:39:25,739
We have worked a lot
on this as well.

706
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:29,128
We have been working
on this movie for a long time.

707
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:32,819
We are totally ready.
- Don't worry, dear.

708
00:39:33,668 --> 00:39:35,411
You are Mr. Srikumar's son.

709
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,887
My husband used to revere him a lot.

710
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:43,038
I have seen the cover of
'Taalpatar Banshi' you drew.

711
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,325
Quite amazing!

712
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:48,034
The money's not everything, dear.

713
00:39:48,863 --> 00:39:52,268
I want this novel to be turned
into a good film.

714
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,659
And I believe you can do that.

715
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:58,436
Ask our lawyer,
Mr. Shashidhar, to make an agreement.

716
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:01,469
I'll give the rights to him.

717
00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:04,998
You can pay me
as per your convenience.

718
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,619
Thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

719
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:12,738
That's all fine,
but, do you have a producer?

720
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:15,078
Yes, we're talking. It will be done.

721
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:16,298
There's nothing to worry.

722
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:19,779
We even take restoration
projects sometimes. Please come.

723
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:25,416
See, we have been doing distribution
since the era of silent movies.

724
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:27,698
We've recently done
four, five movies.

725
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:29,799
We have a rich history.

726
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:32,642
And all these film equipments
you see,

727
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:34,516
quite old.

728
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:37,018
And this camera?

729
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,586
Even I don't know how old this is?

730
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:44,442
We don't just do films for profit.

731
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:47,674
We do come from various
subjects like society,

732
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:50,393
patriotic, revolutionary,

733
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,085
and then the biographies
of various people.

734
00:40:53,608 --> 00:40:57,911
Mr. Bibhuti's Pather Padabali
is a very great novel,

735
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:00,152
I have to agree, but,

736
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:02,938
the way you want to make the film,

737
00:41:03,018 --> 00:41:07,495
well, it is our business.
We can't take this all the time.

738
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,879
But I can tell you this,

739
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,638
if you can somehow gather
the money to make the movie,

740
00:41:12,718 --> 00:41:14,875
distribution will be
my responsibility

741
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:18,928
Thanks a lot, Mr. Amiya.

742
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,974
It's all fine,

743
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:26,139
but can't the movie
have some romance, some fun?

744
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:27,907
Wouldn't it have

745
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,692
been better if it had that?

746
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,734
I hope you understand?
- Yes, it does.

747
00:41:33,146 --> 00:41:35,078
Take this scene, for example.

748
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:36,966
Srinivas, the sweet-seller,

749
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:40,108
is asking Uma, if she wants sweets?

750
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:44,188
But Uma said no because she knows
they don't have that money.

751
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:46,748
And then, chasing Srinivas,

752
00:41:47,314 --> 00:41:51,796
while running around the pond
they are finding their happiness.

753
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:56,641
Where are the tea and sweets?

754
00:41:57,371 --> 00:41:59,638
Please go ahead.
- Next, Manik and Uma

755
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,074
are running through the Kans forest.

756
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:04,429
To see a train
for the first time in their lives.

757
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:07,963
Uma tumbled down,
but Manik kept running.

758
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,401
The train's coming closer

759
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:12,236
running through the Kans forest
and white clouds,

760
00:42:12,316 --> 00:42:14,387
billowing steam all around...
- And the steaming tea is here.

761
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,714
Did you go to Darjeeling
for getting the tea? Seriously?

762
00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:19,548
Sweets please?
- No.

763
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:22,936
This is the local Bheem
Nag's Sandesh, try this.

764
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:25,478
No, I'm not so fond of sweets.

765
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:28,018
What? Do you already
have sugar at this age?

766
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:30,213
No, no, please have sweets.

767
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:33,084
Me? I'm diabetic.

768
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,697
Such a vile disease.

769
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:37,168
I better go to the toilet once.

770
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:40,207
Don't worry,
daughter-in-law told me,

771
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,904
famous writer's famous story.

772
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:45,942
But, at least have some two,
three songs.

773
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:47,628
This is bioscope, right?

774
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,316
Okay, I'll be back.

775
00:42:57,148 --> 00:43:00,085
What? All the money's gone?

776
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:05,091
Okay, do a thing.
Take stuff worth 1,00,000 rupees.

777
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,682
Okay?

778
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,197
This is a tragedy.

779
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:15,877
No.

780
00:43:15,957 --> 00:43:17,768
No hero, heroine,

781
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:20,766
so?

782
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:23,897
Without romance,

783
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,243
what'll audience see?

784
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:29,010
And why would they come to the hall?

785
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:33,903
Do a thing.

786
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:40,247
Write something fresh and come over.

787
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:45,706
Social drama or love story,

788
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:48,009
something like 'Jeebon Jigyasa'.

789
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:51,073
The film has to be emotional.

790
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,438
But modern.

791
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:55,213
New!

792
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:57,959
Keep this.

793
00:43:58,565 --> 00:43:59,738
Yes.

794
00:44:00,158 --> 00:44:02,333
She's a new heroine.

795
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,618
Give her a good role.

796
00:44:06,362 --> 00:44:07,814
But a major part.

797
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:27,207
Apu? What's this?

798
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,143
My insurance policy.

799
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,251
This would get me some 7000 rupees.

800
00:44:34,288 --> 00:44:36,759
What? And these?

801
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:39,044
Are you going to sell these too?

802
00:44:39,124 --> 00:44:41,555
It would hurt me
a little bit to sell these.

803
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,293
I'll buy them back in
installment with my salary.

804
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:48,605
And what would these
books and records fetch you?

805
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:50,451
No what I am trying
to do is shoot a small part,

806
00:44:50,531 --> 00:44:51,899
show that and then
gather some money.

807
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:54,504
That won't do Apu, wait.

808
00:45:02,428 --> 00:45:03,300
Here.

809
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:06,100
If you mortgage these,
you can at least start the movie.

810
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,122
This is your wedding jewellery.

811
00:45:08,592 --> 00:45:11,133
What about mom?
- I'll manage her.

812
00:45:11,213 --> 00:45:12,684
And why do we even need to tell her?

813
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:14,108
Once you get a producer,
we'll get these out.

814
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:15,896
No Vinku, these...
- Apu.

815
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:18,180
Just listen to me.

816
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:20,207
I'm taking this chair.

817
00:45:20,604 --> 00:45:22,118
There's Debashish.

818
00:45:22,198 --> 00:45:24,420
So brother Apu, is Kamaldighi
place done? - Hey, brother Ravi?

819
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,618
One more round.
- No, no, completely.

820
00:45:25,698 --> 00:45:28,998
Yes, sure.
- Brother Apu, that place Kamaldighi,

821
00:45:29,078 --> 00:45:31,595
should be named a swamp not a place.

822
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,149
A muddy swamp named Kamaldighi.

823
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,677
Everywhere you see you have
knee level water, see my condition.

824
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:39,991
And how would you
have a Lotus without mud?

825
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:42,291
That's Mr. Bibhuti's village.

826
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:44,058
The book refers
to that at Shantapur.

827
00:45:44,138 --> 00:45:45,877
No, we can't shoot there.

828
00:45:45,957 --> 00:45:49,073
Tripod and mud is not a good combo.

829
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:53,982
Brother Apu, I invited
a friend of mine a month ago.

830
00:45:54,062 --> 00:45:55,621
The village was named Saral.

831
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:58,946
A nice and serene village,
ideal country-side.

832
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:01,878
This matches your story-board,
you can check that out.

833
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,414
Sure, but how far is it?

834
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,728
Not too far, might be
four, five miles from Kolkata.

835
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:07,728
Then, it's quite close.

836
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,289
And I've a friend there,
Manoj, quite an efficient man.

837
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:12,288
They have ancestral land there,

838
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:13,748
it won't be a problem,
let's check it out.

839
00:46:13,828 --> 00:46:15,200
Good.
- Come, let's check it out.

840
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,117
I can't do it in weekdays,

841
00:46:17,368 --> 00:46:20,222
let's check out your ideal
country-side next Sunday.

842
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:24,997
It is full of Kans trees,
just like this.

843
00:46:25,862 --> 00:46:27,074
All right, great.

844
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:32,427
Yes, this one.

845
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,740
There we are.
- Wow!

846
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:40,137
Amazing, such an awesome place!
- Yeah, sure.

847
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:41,910
Perfect!

848
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,893
The Kans forest cover
such a lot of area.

849
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:48,678
What is this?
- You haven't seen this?

850
00:46:48,758 --> 00:46:50,458
One mm movie camera.

851
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:53,021
My friend,
Cloth Renoir gifted me this.

852
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:55,369
Oh, Renoir sir's nephew?
- Yes.

853
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:58,228
He's here to shoot
Hari Sahab's documentary.

854
00:46:58,308 --> 00:46:59,790
Here?
- Yeah, in Kolkata.

855
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,935
So he rented me for one day.

856
00:47:02,323 --> 00:47:04,539
Even the rail-line's pretty close.
- Just here.

857
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:07,850
Wow, perfect!

858
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:12,583
Such a beautiful
place so close to home?

859
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,046
Yeah, brother.
- Amazing Debu, very good.

860
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:17,488
Just 40 minutes from Tollygunge.

861
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,478
And Mr. Sunil would be happy
with low costs.

862
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,419
You know when I was a kid,

863
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:27,147
Rabindranath signed
my autograph book,

864
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:29,273
and wrote a few lines of poetry.

865
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,478
I couldn't realize the meaning now,

866
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,772
but now I am reminded
of these lines here.

867
00:47:36,282 --> 00:47:38,992
I know the poem
you're talking about.

868
00:47:39,497 --> 00:47:41,627
"For a long while,
a distance of miles,

869
00:47:42,282 --> 00:47:44,247
I spend a lot,
spending nations around..."

870
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:48,268
"The mountain range I saw,
I saw oceans blue..."

871
00:47:49,193 --> 00:47:53,292
"The thing I couldn't see, home,
a few steps along,"

872
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:57,883
"a drop of dew resting
atop a grain of wheat."

873
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:05,761
Vinku?
- Yes?

874
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:09,480
The ad I gave for the guy,
that's published.

875
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:23,171
Hey?
- O mister?

876
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:26,597
"Check the Qutub Minar of Delhi,"

877
00:48:26,677 --> 00:48:28,798
"the miracles of the city Bombay..."
- Hey Apu?

878
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:30,696
Come here, once.
- What?

879
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:32,881
Just come.

880
00:48:36,402 --> 00:48:37,688
Come.

881
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:43,207
The Manik you're looking all over,
he's playing here.

882
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,447
What do you think?

883
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,048
There, that guy. See.
- That one?

884
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,288
No, I can't, show me once.

885
00:48:50,368 --> 00:48:52,022
Hey? Hey boy?

886
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,567
Who, me?

887
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:56,993
Not you, the one next to you,
in check-shirt?

888
00:48:57,414 --> 00:48:59,685
Hey, he's calling for you.

889
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:01,878
You. Yes, you.

890
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:04,045
What's your name?
- Prabir,

891
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,538
Prabir Banerjee.

892
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:07,290
Prabir?

893
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:10,648
Would you come upstairs once?
That's the stairs.

894
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:13,574
"Check the miracles of city Bombay."
- Come, come...

895
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:16,525
"For your money..."

896
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:30,578
Hey, Debashish?
- Yes?

897
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,762
Can you speak dialogues?

898
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:37,344
I surely can.
- Yeah.

899
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:40,189
Such huge parts
had to be said in a breath.

900
00:49:40,668 --> 00:49:42,488
Okay, can I hear one, two lines?

901
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:45,278
No, I don't remember
anything as such.

902
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,178
That was so long back.

903
00:49:47,258 --> 00:49:49,558
Theatres, plays,

904
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:51,595
I have also done few bioscopes.

905
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:53,598
Historical, Social,

906
00:49:53,678 --> 00:49:55,688
would you listen to a poem?

907
00:49:55,768 --> 00:49:57,085
Fine, sure.

908
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:01,625
"O my aunts dear,
come to house mine."

909
00:50:01,894 --> 00:50:03,948
"Not a bed, or Diwan either."

910
00:50:04,028 --> 00:50:06,404
So dear, how much would you pay me?

911
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,372
How much do you want?

912
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,028
I'll take 20 rupees daily.

913
00:50:12,378 --> 00:50:13,586
Okay, fine, that'll be done.

914
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:17,125
She needs a little opium daily.

915
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:21,088
Actually, at the end of the day,

916
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:25,308
without that, and a little milk.

917
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:27,118
Okay, that'll be done, don't worry.

918
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:29,101
Okay, okay.

919
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:31,099
Okay, fine.

920
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:34,291
What are you writing?

921
00:50:34,747 --> 00:50:37,387
We had few letters wishing new year,
just replied to those.

922
00:50:37,706 --> 00:50:40,186
How did it go?
- You won't believe it, Vinku.

923
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:41,838
She's just right, perfect in fact.

924
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:45,428
She fits the role to a T, as if
she's one Mr. Bibhuti wrote about.

925
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:47,505
That's great news, Apu.

926
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:50,507
I thought it would be very
difficult to get someone like that.

927
00:50:50,587 --> 00:50:52,168
But I must say,
you are very lucky, Apu.

928
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:53,948
The luck is surely a factor.

929
00:50:54,028 --> 00:50:55,615
But we have looked everywhere.

930
00:50:55,695 --> 00:50:58,278
And then we found this precious gem.

931
00:50:58,358 --> 00:50:59,778
Got it?
- Yes.

932
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:02,398
And this precious gem
can act naturally?

933
00:51:02,478 --> 00:51:05,232
It does seem so,
she seemed like a true professional.

934
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,784
Who said they won't work
with professional actors?

935
00:51:08,864 --> 00:51:11,348
I was talking about big stars.

936
00:51:11,428 --> 00:51:13,879
Their acting style
is full of mannerisms.

937
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:15,544
First the sing-song delivery,

938
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:17,738
and they can't work
without full makeup.

939
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:18,998
They won't listen either.

940
00:51:19,078 --> 00:51:20,588
I can't afford them.

941
00:51:21,557 --> 00:51:23,748
I will hire some character actors,

942
00:51:24,178 --> 00:51:25,616
who are very talented.

943
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:28,708
And the rest have
to be amateurs, like,

944
00:51:29,076 --> 00:51:31,463
Rossi did in 'the bicycle rider'.

945
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,206
And did you find someone like that?

946
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:37,722
The character of 'Sarvamangala'
is very important.

947
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,938
My friend, Sambid Bandopadhyaya,
his wife will do that.

948
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,510
An active member of communist party.

949
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:47,718
I have seen her act in Picos
theatre, very powerful actress.

950
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:49,373
Has she done cinema before?

951
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,817
Leftists,
they are a bit snobby, Vinku.

952
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:56,158
They consider Bengali
commercial film to be low-grade.

953
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,620
They don't consider cinema
as a valid art format.

954
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:03,185
I will take that girl.
Open the door, I'll just change.

955
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:08,678
Sing that song, dear,
"Chaander Hasir Baandh Bhenge."

956
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:11,502
No need,
I don't need songs for my film.

957
00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:13,436
She can dance too, dance.

958
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:15,558
"Aye Tori Sahchari",
what you did at home.

959
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:19,413
Listen, I don't need dance either,
I have seen what I had to.

960
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:23,924
See, she doesn't match
what I am looking for.

961
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:26,670
She's a bit too
city-like for this movie.

962
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:29,566
If needed,
I'll tell you later. Okay?

963
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:33,098
And immense thanks for
taking the pains to find my house.

964
00:52:33,178 --> 00:52:35,077
Will you have tea?
- Apu?

965
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:38,205
One minute, let me...
- What will you do?

966
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,448
Will you come inside with me?

967
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:42,331
Vinku?
- You too, just a minute.

968
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,981
Come.

969
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:48,820
This side.

970
00:53:15,934 --> 00:53:17,223
Come.

971
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:22,063
Look at her.
Does she look like your Uma?

972
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,125
Absolutely.

973
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,608
Keep some loose change with you.

974
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:30,886
Today, is the first
day of the shoot.

975
00:53:30,966 --> 00:53:32,238
It would have been great if you
also came. - Even I wanted to go.

976
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:34,948
But I have to take Mother
to the doctor today positively.

977
00:53:35,028 --> 00:53:36,436
Take blessings by bowing
down to Father's picture

978
00:53:36,516 --> 00:53:38,216
and go meet Mother once.
- Okay.

979
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:40,421
You all be seated.

980
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:42,183
I'll be back soon.
- Sure.

981
00:53:42,263 --> 00:53:44,634
So, everyone ready?
- Absolutely.

982
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,190
Ready for war.
- Great.

983
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,534
It would be great. All the best.
- Thank you.

984
00:53:47,614 --> 00:53:48,681
It's been so long
you haven't cooked anything for us.

985
00:53:48,761 --> 00:53:49,598
Say something, Subir.

986
00:53:49,678 --> 00:53:50,644
Yes, especially that
'luchi' and mutton curry

987
00:53:50,724 --> 00:53:52,384
Yes.
- You all win the war and come back.

988
00:53:52,464 --> 00:53:53,430
Then you can have it tonight only.

989
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,723
Prahlad, they will be
having dinner with us tonight.

990
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:58,298
Okay. Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

991
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:00,358
Brother Apu, here.

992
00:54:01,274 --> 00:54:02,208
All the best.

993
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:03,563
Thank you.
- Thank you.

994
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:16,496
Be careful.

995
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:31,623
We anyhow found
the Kans Grass forest

996
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:33,301
and the railway track beside it.

997
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,468
But, when I went there to shoot,
I saw...

998
00:54:36,868 --> 00:54:38,518
the fields were empty.

999
00:54:38,878 --> 00:54:40,334
There wasn't a single
Kans Grass there.

1000
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:42,773
We got completely shattered.

1001
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:44,458
Someone cut it all off?

1002
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:46,245
No, apparently the cows grazed it.

1003
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:50,881
Of course,
we shot a small sequence there.

1004
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,712
And for the rest of it,
we had to shoot it the next year.

1005
00:54:58,189 --> 00:55:01,663
Cut, cut, cut.
What did I tell you, Prabir?

1006
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,488
When you'll come here,
come while looking around.

1007
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:07,308
Why would you keep looking around?

1008
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,068
You are searching for your Sister.
Aren't you?

1009
00:55:09,148 --> 00:55:09,983
Understood?
- Yes.

1010
00:55:10,063 --> 00:55:11,988
Let's start again quickly.

1011
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:14,232
Going for another take.

1012
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:16,078
Okay. Let's go.

1013
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:17,586
One more time.
-Yes, let's go.

1014
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,649
Prabir ready?

1015
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,151
Roll sound.
-Rolling sir.

1016
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:22,478
Roll camera.

1017
00:55:22,558 --> 00:55:27,199
Rolling. 'Pather Padavali'.
Scene 42/2. Take 14.

1018
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:29,039
And action.

1019
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:39,426
No, no. Cut, cut, cut.

1020
00:55:39,847 --> 00:55:42,298
How would it happen?
He is marching like the military.

1021
00:55:42,378 --> 00:55:44,878
No. It won't happen this way.

1022
00:55:45,662 --> 00:55:47,368
We have to plan it differently.

1023
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:50,275
Okay, Prabir?
- Check the sound.

1024
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,678
You go and take some rest.

1025
00:55:53,758 --> 00:55:55,576
Is anyone there?
Please give some water.

1026
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:56,878
Hey, give him some water.

1027
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:59,218
You all please come this side.
-Yes.

1028
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:01,133
Only you come.
- Yes.

1029
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:09,528
Give me the spinning top.

1030
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:12,582
How many people do we have?

1031
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:16,065
Five people.
- Five people?

1032
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:18,349
What?

1033
00:56:26,786 --> 00:56:28,199
Okay? Come, let's check again.

1034
00:56:28,407 --> 00:56:29,738
We'll go again.

1035
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:31,938
Camera?
- Rolling.

1036
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:33,753
And action!

1037
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:39,460
Manik?
- Manik.

1038
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:41,174
Prabir?

1039
00:56:41,254 --> 00:56:42,579
Prabir?
- Prabir?

1040
00:56:44,928 --> 00:56:47,054
Got it. Excellent.

1041
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:50,533
Very good. Very good.

1042
00:56:50,613 --> 00:56:53,008
Everyone has done very good.
- Very good. Very good.

1043
00:56:53,088 --> 00:56:55,143
You can do it, dear.

1044
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,068
Slowly, slowly.. Go there, go there.

1045
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:00,605
I'll change the reading.

1046
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:04,888
Brother Apu, please check
if the position of Uma is alright.

1047
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:07,220
Subir, make Devi sit in such a way,

1048
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,738
that the distance is maintained.

1049
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:11,348
So that she could cover
his mouth with her hands.

1050
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,603
Check once if you can cover
your Brother's mouth

1051
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:14,340
with your hand properly.
- Prabhir!

1052
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:16,918
You have to make sure that
the sugarcane is pointed...

1053
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:18,116
Where is the sugarcane?

1054
00:57:18,196 --> 00:57:19,838
Who will take care of the continuity?
- Where is the sugarcane?

1055
00:57:19,918 --> 00:57:21,951
Do I have to check everything?
Get me the sugarcane.

1056
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:23,000
Take this.
- Okay.

1057
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,838
Show me how will
you have the sugarcane?

1058
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,005
Hold it like a flute.
- Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:30,490
Not like that. Give it to me.

1060
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:33,928
Hold it like this.
Hold it like a flute. Okay?

1061
00:57:34,008 --> 00:57:35,984
Like this. Okay? Hold it.

1062
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:38,778
Devi, do you remember the dialogues?
- Yes.

1063
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:40,700
Deliver them once.
- You start it.

1064
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,032
Say it.
- Where did we come, dear?

1065
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:45,354
Just eat it.
- What are those?

1066
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:47,038
Say it properly.

1067
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:48,103
Point at them
and ask what are those?

1068
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:50,400
What are those, dear.
- Say it loudly. What are those?

1069
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,808
What are those? Repeat after me.

1070
00:57:51,888 --> 00:57:53,532
What are those, dear?
- Very good.

1071
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:55,737
Then?

1072
00:57:58,906 --> 00:58:01,373
If Mother gets to know about it...

1073
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:05,267
Okay Devi. This is the time
when you would hear the noise. Okay?

1074
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:08,938
You'll cover his mouth in between
when he would be speaking.

1075
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,988
You'll try to hear it and figure out
where is the noise coming from.

1076
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:13,439
Okay?

1077
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:15,458
You'll stand up.

1078
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:17,616
And once Sister stands up,
what will you do, Prabir?

1079
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:18,972
I'll also stand up.
- Very good.

1080
00:58:19,052 --> 00:58:20,268
You'll also stand up. Okay?

1081
00:58:20,348 --> 00:58:22,186
Then paying your complete attention,

1082
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:24,338
you'll try to figure
out the noise of the train.

1083
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,628
That where is it coming from?

1084
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,087
Keep looking around.
- Keep looking around.

1085
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:28,630
Very good. Let's go for a rehearsal.

1086
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:30,658
Let's go for a rehearsal.
- Yes, let's go.

1087
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:32,620
Let's go for a rehearsal.
- Sure.

1088
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:34,818
It has to be okay
in one single take. Okay?

1089
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:36,548
We have some time.
Do the rehearsal nicely.

1090
00:58:36,628 --> 00:58:38,548
Yes.
- Yes.

1091
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:43,066
Should I give it?

1092
00:58:44,248 --> 00:58:46,027
Should I give you a blanket?
- Brother Apu?

1093
00:58:46,866 --> 00:58:48,177
This...

1094
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:52,075
Will this entire film
be wasted on one shot?

1095
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:55,427
So much action,

1096
00:58:56,043 --> 00:58:57,517
dialogues,

1097
00:58:57,828 --> 00:59:00,036
and the train...

1098
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:02,101
Can you do it in one take?

1099
00:59:02,761 --> 00:59:05,520
If it doesn't work,
if it becomes NG, then another tape.

1100
00:59:05,772 --> 00:59:06,870
Another hour.

1101
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:10,813
No Subir, you are right...

1102
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,055
What can we do?
How long for the train?

1103
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:17,089
Still 45 minutes.

1104
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:19,345
45 minutes?

1105
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:23,831
Hey Debashish,
please bring the script once.

1106
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,633
Hey.
- Shut up.

1107
00:59:27,713 --> 00:59:28,935
Quick, quick!

1108
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,561
Please hold.
- Give it to me.

1109
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:35,586
And focus from here...
- Hey Subir?

1110
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:36,649
Yes.

1111
00:59:37,455 --> 00:59:38,952
I don't know,
what will happen after two days?

1112
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,377
What if we break it up
into two shots?

1113
00:59:42,691 --> 00:59:44,558
Yes?
- Suppose,

1114
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,002
first shot is cut when they stand.

1115
00:59:48,082 --> 00:59:48,912
Okay.

1116
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:53,218
And for the second shot,
we raise the camera to a height.

1117
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,130
Yes.

1118
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:57,458
They enter on a blank frame,
from below the camera.

1119
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,623
And then we show
the shot of the train,

1120
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:03,788
they can see here
and there on the frame

1121
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:05,841
then frame out, won't it be easier?

1122
01:00:06,192 --> 01:00:07,673
And it will mitigate the risk too.

1123
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:09,074
Good idea.

1124
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:11,729
Then let's start?
- Yes. Brother Jadav, let's go.

1125
01:00:12,168 --> 01:00:14,273
Come, let's go.
- Yes, we are ready.

1126
01:00:14,592 --> 01:00:16,672
Come. Order.

1127
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:18,889
Yeah...

1128
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:21,277
Roll sound.
- Rolling.

1129
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,838
Roll camera.
- Rolling.

1130
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:29,090
Pather Padabali,
scene 43/1, take one.

1131
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:31,175
And action.

1132
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,070
Where are we?

1133
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:34,802
Just eat.

1134
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:38,968
What's that?

1135
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,227
If mother learns of it, she'll...

1136
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:49,770
Cut it.

1137
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,066
Such amazing scene.

1138
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,160
And it's impact,

1139
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:19,963
this train scene
will be an iconic scene.

1140
01:01:20,859 --> 01:01:25,755
See, honestly, we didn't have any
experience of shooting before this.

1141
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:28,426
We didn't have a concrete
idea of the technicalities

1142
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:30,088
and the nitty-grity of cinema.

1143
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:32,038
For example, the scene where

1144
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,035
Manik sees the train
and runs towards it.

1145
01:01:35,998 --> 01:01:38,568
If you notice it carefully,
you'll see,

1146
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:41,861
the train, billowing steam is coming
from the right side of the frame.

1147
01:01:42,257 --> 01:01:43,957
And the camera's behind Manik.

1148
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:45,788
Back to the camera.
- Is this sir?

1149
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,518
Softly...
- So I couldn't see Manik's reaction,

1150
01:01:48,598 --> 01:01:51,462
but I wanted to
catch his expression.

1151
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,054
So I took the camera
to the opposite end.

1152
01:01:54,302 --> 01:01:56,570
And then, the train, comes from left

1153
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,148
on the foreground, instead of right.

1154
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:02,589
This was a huge error
in the grammar of film.

1155
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,303
See, in the film definition, there's
a concept of 180 imaginary line.

1156
01:02:08,512 --> 01:02:11,527
Suppose, we are sitting here,
and the camera's here,

1157
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,018
you are on right of camera,
and I'm on left.

1158
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:16,846
If I take the camera
to the opposite end,

1159
01:02:16,926 --> 01:02:18,629
our sitting position changes.

1160
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:20,409
You go to the left, and I on right.

1161
01:02:20,968 --> 01:02:24,636
And if you use those shots
consecutively in editing,

1162
01:02:25,015 --> 01:02:28,023
it creates a jerk,
audience will get a shock.

1163
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:29,410
This is an error.

1164
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:33,078
But later, some film critics,
specially abroad, started saying,

1165
01:02:33,158 --> 01:02:36,057
the impact created
due to breaking this rule,

1166
01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:38,017
is amazing, incredible!

1167
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:42,926
But this wasn't intentional,
rather due to our lack of knowledge.

1168
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:45,008
We did it by mistake.

1169
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,059
It was a hassle to educate Apu.

1170
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:50,392
He learned to draw in Kala Niketan.

1171
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:53,068
Why? To rot away in a bioscope?

1172
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:55,260
Is Apu the type of man to rot away?

1173
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:57,859
He's very talented and innovative.

1174
01:02:58,773 --> 01:03:00,618
Else, such a movie,

1175
01:03:00,698 --> 01:03:04,306
has anyone ever taken
their own picture?

1176
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:09,628
You tell me, how much does Apu earn?

1177
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,519
Around 75 rupees.
- Then?

1178
01:03:11,749 --> 01:03:14,384
Is this a meagre
amount in this time?

1179
01:03:15,145 --> 01:03:16,848
That's why I am shouting.

1180
01:03:17,363 --> 01:03:18,865
Leaving behind such a great job....

1181
01:03:19,574 --> 01:03:21,685
Surma, you are not getting it.

1182
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:25,721
When Apu entered the work force,
he started at 35 rupees.

1183
01:03:26,075 --> 01:03:29,246
And that has increased
to 75 rupees in these few days.

1184
01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:30,578
Can you imagine that?

1185
01:03:30,658 --> 01:03:34,918
You see, he'll gain international
fame with this cinema.

1186
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:38,748
The shooting went
on for few days, then?

1187
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:42,301
What then? Looking for money?

1188
01:03:42,908 --> 01:03:45,997
But a generous man,
whose name I won't take,

1189
01:03:47,093 --> 01:03:48,978
agreed to produce.
- Wow!

1190
01:03:49,678 --> 01:03:51,214
Why not take the name?

1191
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:56,638
See, that producer used to roll
money from one movie to another.

1192
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:57,978
As luck would have it,

1193
01:03:58,058 --> 01:04:01,488
one of that producer's
film was a massive flop.

1194
01:04:01,568 --> 01:04:02,567
Then?

1195
01:04:02,647 --> 01:04:05,442
What else? Producer went missing.

1196
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:07,638
Shooting stopped, no money.

1197
01:04:08,113 --> 01:04:09,944
The shooting was stopped
for a whole year.

1198
01:04:14,914 --> 01:04:17,798
Nave.
- Nave? You mean, naive?

1199
01:04:18,658 --> 01:04:19,658
Naive.

1200
01:04:19,738 --> 01:04:21,483
That's naive, this is nave. N-A-V-E.
- That's...

1201
01:04:21,563 --> 01:04:23,468
That's K-N-A-V-E.

1202
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:25,785
Why would it be K-N-A-V-E?
This is N-A-V-E, nave.

1203
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:27,759
That's not a word, Vinku.

1204
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,268
Who said so? I read it in convent.

1205
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:30,749
N-A-V-E means... - No. Just
because you studied in convent,

1206
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,828
doesn't mean you would
know better English.

1207
01:04:32,908 --> 01:04:34,320
Why are you talking like this?

1208
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,593
That's not what I mean.

1209
01:04:35,673 --> 01:04:36,843
There's something called N-A-V-E,

1210
01:04:36,923 --> 01:04:39,168
it's something to do with
the church, I studied in convent.

1211
01:04:39,477 --> 01:04:40,798
Wait, let me check the dictionary.

1212
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:44,230
Just criticism..

1213
01:04:47,757 --> 01:04:50,077
Where's the Oxford one?
- I don't know.

1214
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,460
N-A-V-E, nave.

1215
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:56,748
Here,

1216
01:04:57,255 --> 01:04:59,855
nave is the long
central part of a church

1217
01:04:59,935 --> 01:05:01,048
where most of the seatings are.

1218
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:04,182
I told you.
- Okay, you know everything, okay.

1219
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,275
Why are you reacting like this, Apu?
What happened?

1220
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:11,769
You are so high strung lately.

1221
01:05:12,235 --> 01:05:16,272
As you like board games, I thought
Scrabble might relax you a bit.

1222
01:05:16,764 --> 01:05:18,204
It's just a game, Apu.

1223
01:05:19,627 --> 01:05:21,607
I can realize that....
- No, you don't realize anything.

1224
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:23,522
Vinku, nothing.

1225
01:05:24,328 --> 01:05:26,319
The shooting has been
stopped for so long.

1226
01:05:26,399 --> 01:05:27,856
Aunt Sheila has put her money here.

1227
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:29,719
And so did Kiran.

1228
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:32,024
I have no idea how
I'll pay them back.

1229
01:05:32,418 --> 01:05:33,377
And the worse thing is

1230
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:36,268
I have no idea whether I'll
even be able to resume shooting.

1231
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:38,836
We even had to
mortgage your jewellery.

1232
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,644
Did I ever say a word about jewellery?

1233
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:42,312
You'll get it out
once you have money.

1234
01:05:42,392 --> 01:05:44,714
I haven't been able to shoot
even a day in the last year.

1235
01:05:45,636 --> 01:05:47,161
And with Nonibala Devi's age,

1236
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:48,993
God forbid,
if something happens now,

1237
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:50,415
all the efforts
will come to a naught.

1238
01:05:50,495 --> 01:05:51,799
Nothing will come to a naught.

1239
01:05:52,213 --> 01:05:56,059
There was a white owl outside this
window that day. That's a good omen.

1240
01:05:57,329 --> 01:06:00,089
Vinku, I'm not amused,
it's a cruel joke.

1241
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:01,969
It's not a joke.

1242
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:04,342
Don't get so depressed
and don't lose hope.

1243
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:09,824
Aunt Sheila said,
they know Bimaan Roy quite well.

1244
01:06:09,904 --> 01:06:12,229
Maybe we can talk to
him and come to a solution.

1245
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:15,309
Who? Bimaan Roy? Chief minister?
- Yes.

1246
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,309
Have you lost it?
- Why?

1247
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:19,229
He is worried about
our entire state.

1248
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,289
And you expect him
to drop everything

1249
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:23,213
and tell us how to
resume 'Pather Padabali'?

1250
01:06:23,575 --> 01:06:26,719
And I have heard he's
a very strict person.

1251
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:29,293
He doesn't value art, most
probably he doesn't understand it.

1252
01:06:29,373 --> 01:06:30,836
Don't talk rubbish, Apu.

1253
01:06:31,223 --> 01:06:33,380
It is true that he is a
little cut and dry type of person,

1254
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,393
but that doesn't mean
he doesn't understand anything.

1255
01:06:35,473 --> 01:06:38,026
He's a very learned man.
I'm sure he will appreciate it.

1256
01:06:38,388 --> 01:06:40,355
And even he is a Bengali like us.

1257
01:06:40,435 --> 01:06:43,581
So he might just....
- You have weird ideas, Vinku.

1258
01:06:44,073 --> 01:06:46,996
Aunt Sheila's daughter,
Archita, is my school junior.

1259
01:06:47,076 --> 01:06:50,256
She'll take you there,
just see how it goes. Please.

1260
01:06:50,336 --> 01:06:53,244
Sarvamanagla informed
Harimadhav of Uma's death.

1261
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:57,282
I want to make this
scene quite impactful.

1262
01:07:03,143 --> 01:07:04,323
Yes, go ahead.

1263
01:07:05,038 --> 01:07:06,467
Carry on, I am listening.

1264
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:10,841
And then Sarvamangala
told their neighbours,

1265
01:07:11,387 --> 01:07:12,929
they're leaving the village.

1266
01:07:13,514 --> 01:07:15,829
Because there's no scope
of livelihood here.

1267
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:17,243
And if they stay here,

1268
01:07:17,323 --> 01:07:19,839
they won't be able to recover
from the shock of Uma's death.

1269
01:07:21,408 --> 01:07:24,724
The neighbours did express sorrow,
but they didn't agree with them.

1270
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:28,060
The village elders
came to Harimadhav's house,

1271
01:07:28,662 --> 01:07:32,327
to try to stop Hari from
leaving his ancestral house.

1272
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,318
But he, Harimadhav, I mean,

1273
01:07:35,054 --> 01:07:38,643
had decided
that he'll go to Kashi by then.

1274
01:07:39,275 --> 01:07:42,119
The packing's done,
the kitchen's wrapped up.

1275
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,382
He couldn't even offer
the guests tea and smoke.

1276
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:46,916
Harimadhav...
- Oh, my...

1277
01:07:47,536 --> 01:07:50,647
I asked you for tea,
but forgot to order it.

1278
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:52,397
Please.
- I'll take care of it, Sir.

1279
01:07:52,729 --> 01:07:54,695
We can have the tea later,
Uncle Viman.

1280
01:07:55,032 --> 01:07:57,151
Rather, you listen
to the end of the story.

1281
01:07:57,231 --> 01:07:58,829
It's just a little bit more.

1282
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,553
Send four cups of tea in a pot,

1283
01:08:01,959 --> 01:08:03,753
sugar and milk separately.

1284
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,388
Sorry, go ahead.

1285
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:13,138
Harimadhav had decided that he'll
go to Banaras to earn a living.

1286
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,463
Why Banaras?
What's wrong with Kolkata?

1287
01:08:15,749 --> 01:08:18,739
No, that's famous
for the priestly works.

1288
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:20,302
Okay, okay, go on.

1289
01:08:20,634 --> 01:08:24,314
Harimadhav had decided that he'll
go to Banaras to earn a living.

1290
01:08:25,062 --> 01:08:29,000
He didn't even have the money
to repair his house.

1291
01:08:29,483 --> 01:08:32,959
He decided to sell whatever
he had to pay back the debt.

1292
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:36,367
And the last scene, where we'll show

1293
01:08:36,843 --> 01:08:38,474
Harimadhav and his family

1294
01:08:38,777 --> 01:08:41,718
are leaving Shantipur
village in a bullock-cart.

1295
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,141
Sarvamangala's eyes were teary,

1296
01:08:44,707 --> 01:08:47,032
Their house is in
a dilapidated state.

1297
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,647
A snake enters the house.

1298
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:51,729
And then?

1299
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:53,871
Then End.

1300
01:08:54,482 --> 01:08:57,726
What? Why would Harimadhav
leave the village?

1301
01:08:58,025 --> 01:09:01,514
There are so many community
development projects in the villages.

1302
01:09:01,956 --> 01:09:03,132
No, that can't be.

1303
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:05,319
Change the ending.

1304
01:09:05,912 --> 01:09:10,039
Harimadhav,
with the other villagers,

1305
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:12,764
took a loan from the government
to run a tractor.

1306
01:09:13,301 --> 01:09:14,909
Yes, he can't go to Kashi.

1307
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:16,580
Then,

1308
01:09:17,543 --> 01:09:19,433
the movie will end on a happy note,

1309
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,081
there will be hope.

1310
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:24,559
Audience will leave
the hall on a happy note.

1311
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:27,938
Yes, change it.
- Yes, very good idea.

1312
01:09:28,227 --> 01:09:31,452
No, Will such a drastic
change be possible?

1313
01:09:32,014 --> 01:09:35,161
And this is based on the very
famous novel by Bibhuti Mukherjee.

1314
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:38,138
Almost all of us know the ending.

1315
01:09:38,218 --> 01:09:41,216
In this case, without the writer's
consent, how can we suddenly...

1316
01:09:42,699 --> 01:09:45,609
Request Mr Bibhuti to change
the ending, take my name.

1317
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:49,111
Else I won't be able to take
the money out from community funds.

1318
01:09:49,445 --> 01:09:52,199
No, that's a bit difficult.

1319
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:53,265
Why difficult?

1320
01:09:53,741 --> 01:09:56,851
He left.

1321
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:59,636
So tell him when he returns.
When is he coming back?

1322
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:02,269
He's not in this world anymore.

1323
01:10:03,084 --> 01:10:05,592
Oh, sorry! See...

1324
01:10:06,006 --> 01:10:10,719
I forgot about the death
of such a renowned writer.

1325
01:10:10,799 --> 01:10:11,942
Very sorry.

1326
01:10:13,234 --> 01:10:15,459
Keep the tea there, we'll take this.

1327
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:17,659
Then what can we do here?

1328
01:10:17,939 --> 01:10:19,396
What can we do in this case?

1329
01:10:19,713 --> 01:10:21,859
I.. I...

1330
01:10:21,939 --> 01:10:24,645
There's no way
other than the community funds.

1331
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,222
What can I do here?

1332
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:28,111
Can I suggest something, sir?
- Yes.

1333
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:31,660
The name of the story is Pather...
- Pather Padabali.

1334
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:34,368
Ballad of the road.
- Yes, yes.

1335
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:36,294
So I was thinking,

1336
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:39,539
from road department, I mean PWD,

1337
01:10:39,619 --> 01:10:41,987
if we release a fund?

1338
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,981
Excellent!

1339
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:47,999
Do a thing,

1340
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:51,764
give them the fund reserved
for making highway in Siliguri.

1341
01:10:52,824 --> 01:10:56,766
I'll arrange something
for the land in the next quarter.

1342
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:01,717
Menon will pay you something,
use that to start.

1343
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:04,122
What did you say was your name,
Aparajito?

1344
01:11:04,202 --> 01:11:06,305
The name is quite unique...

1345
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,068
Go with him,
he will explain the formalities.

1346
01:11:09,148 --> 01:11:12,307
Okay? First, you'll get an advance,

1347
01:11:12,646 --> 01:11:13,953
and then after your account for it,

1348
01:11:14,617 --> 01:11:16,534
the next part, so you will
get the money in installments.

1349
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:18,149
Go with him, take them.

1350
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:20,181
Thank you so much.
- That's fine.

1351
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:22,035
Thank you, uncle Vimaan.

1352
01:11:22,335 --> 01:11:23,821
Apu's a very talented boy.

1353
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:27,025
You see, he'll never disappoint you.

1354
01:11:27,105 --> 01:11:28,491
I know that.

1355
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,227
Hey, please have the tea.

1356
01:11:32,509 --> 01:11:34,449
Sit. Please give them the tea.
- Yes, sir.

1357
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:39,329
Aparajito?

1358
01:11:40,552 --> 01:11:41,896
Who is it?

1359
01:11:43,144 --> 01:11:44,949
What is happening here?

1360
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,491
Where is this light coming from?

1361
01:11:48,927 --> 01:11:51,125
This has fallen down.
- Okay silence.

1362
01:11:51,205 --> 01:11:53,309
What are you even shooting,
Debashish?

1363
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:55,169
Tank will be over.
- He's conscious.

1364
01:11:55,249 --> 01:11:57,733
What's happening here?
- Okay, fine, sit.

1365
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:03,311
Pather Padabali, scene 43/1.
Take One, action.

1366
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:06,326
Hey, this wasn't part of the script.

1367
01:12:06,977 --> 01:12:11,188
Why are you shooting
without informing me?

1368
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:16,379
This wasn't there.

1369
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:20,439
"Spend a lot,
roaming nations across.."

1370
01:12:20,519 --> 01:12:23,879
"Mountains I went to see,
went to see oceans blue."

1371
01:12:23,959 --> 01:12:26,109
"Just couldn't see my home..."

1372
01:12:26,189 --> 01:12:30,059
Stop the shooting. Can you hear me?

1373
01:12:31,676 --> 01:12:33,257
Who?

1374
01:12:36,635 --> 01:12:37,946
Apu?

1375
01:12:38,995 --> 01:12:40,579
Apu, it's me, Vinku.

1376
01:12:40,659 --> 01:12:42,742
Who? Vinku?

1377
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,081
Come.

1378
01:12:45,626 --> 01:12:50,288
Where? Where are you going, Vinku?

1379
01:12:50,368 --> 01:12:52,830
Vinku!

1380
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:56,094
See there.

1381
01:13:00,548 --> 01:13:03,515
Is this the owl you were talking...

1382
01:13:04,175 --> 01:13:05,622
Vinku?

1383
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:26,142
Fire.

1384
01:13:27,156 --> 01:13:28,755
Hey, Apu?
- Apu.

1385
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:30,578
What are you mumbling?

1386
01:13:31,176 --> 01:13:32,280
Huh?

1387
01:13:32,798 --> 01:13:34,068
What happened?

1388
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:36,141
No, nothing.

1389
01:13:37,165 --> 01:13:38,646
Just a nightmare.

1390
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:40,959
No more.

1391
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:44,374
It seems your advance
cheque is here.

1392
01:13:44,905 --> 01:13:46,084
What? Let me see.

1393
01:13:55,089 --> 01:13:56,315
Correct.

1394
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,938
Let me give my clients
this good news.

1395
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:00,661
Hey.
- What?

1396
01:14:00,741 --> 01:14:02,009
There's another news.

1397
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:03,543
What?

1398
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:06,795
A new family member
is coming to our house.

1399
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:09,858
Most probably,
he got your work done.

1400
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:12,983
What?

1401
01:14:15,612 --> 01:14:17,577
Finally, the lady luck

1402
01:14:17,942 --> 01:14:19,698
was happy on me.

1403
01:14:20,597 --> 01:14:21,626
How?

1404
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:26,758
I realize that if I only
shoot on Sundays and holidays,

1405
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:29,907
it'd be years before
this shooting is over.

1406
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:33,003
So, either I have to leave the job,

1407
01:14:33,358 --> 01:14:37,575
or I had to apply for a long leave.

1408
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:40,724
I had a new boss by then,
Mr.Newman.

1409
01:14:41,503 --> 01:14:44,783
Whether he'll be generous
towards me, like Mr. Brown,

1410
01:14:45,262 --> 01:14:46,451
I had no idea.

1411
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:48,479
I don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Newman.

1412
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:50,803
I shall always be
obliged to you for this.

1413
01:14:51,277 --> 01:14:52,689
You're welcome, Mr. Ray.

1414
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:54,954
And I wish you all
the best in your venture.

1415
01:14:55,551 --> 01:14:57,442
You've got a great story to tell.

1416
01:14:57,942 --> 01:15:00,919
And I hope you remember to come back
to us when your shooting is done.

1417
01:15:00,999 --> 01:15:02,147
Certainly, sir.

1418
01:15:02,227 --> 01:15:03,601
Thank you once again.
- You're welcome.

1419
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,030
Hey Apu?

1420
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,049
What happened?

1421
01:15:10,558 --> 01:15:12,805
Done.
- Congratulations.

1422
01:15:12,885 --> 01:15:15,324
He's even a step ahead of Mr. Brown.

1423
01:15:15,404 --> 01:15:16,833
I really couldn't imagine,

1424
01:15:16,913 --> 01:15:20,092
that he'd give me such a long,
extended leave.

1425
01:15:20,172 --> 01:15:21,456
And that too, leave with pay.

1426
01:15:21,536 --> 01:15:23,420
This is a gift in disguise.

1427
01:15:23,848 --> 01:15:26,619
Yeah, so kind of him...
- Nothing kind as such.

1428
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:29,051
They don't want to
lose an asset like you.

1429
01:15:29,131 --> 01:15:33,187
By the way, I don't want
to lose my cover designer.

1430
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:36,199
Keep that in mind, later
you'll be the film director and..

1431
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:38,235
A lot could have
happened in this year.

1432
01:15:38,469 --> 01:15:41,114
With Manik's age,
his voice could have broken.

1433
01:15:41,614 --> 01:15:44,487
And with Nonibala Devi's age
and physical condition,

1434
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:46,612
anyday, she could have...
- Please keep your head down.

1435
01:15:46,949 --> 01:15:48,609
Please keep your head down.

1436
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:50,617
Between your knees, okay?
- Yes.

1437
01:15:50,697 --> 01:15:52,281
Here, look at me.

1438
01:15:53,035 --> 01:15:54,023
Bend now, bend.

1439
01:15:54,395 --> 01:15:56,081
Bend completely, completely.

1440
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:57,549
This is not a problem, right?

1441
01:15:57,629 --> 01:15:59,179
No.
- Fine.

1442
01:15:59,532 --> 01:16:00,614
Subir?
- Yes?

1443
01:16:00,694 --> 01:16:03,244
Let's go, let's go to the ground.
- One minute.

1444
01:16:04,009 --> 01:16:05,310
Come.
- Wait.

1445
01:16:05,713 --> 01:16:07,276
Going for take.
- Okay, yes.

1446
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,034
Yes, blanket.

1447
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,827
Hey!

1448
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:13,179
First position, please.

1449
01:16:13,533 --> 01:16:15,358
Brother, is it fine?
- Yes, fine.

1450
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:19,063
Yeah, yeah, fine.

1451
01:16:19,143 --> 01:16:20,687
That's enough.
- This is first one.

1452
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:22,269
Order please.

1453
01:16:22,349 --> 01:16:23,797
Roll sound.
- Rolling.

1454
01:16:24,052 --> 01:16:25,601
Roll camera.
- Rolling.

1455
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,930
Pather Padabali, scene 70, take one.
- And action.

1456
01:16:36,442 --> 01:16:37,356
Cut it.
- Okay.

1457
01:16:37,436 --> 01:16:39,331
Okay. Good, quite good.

1458
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:49,193
Aunt? Hey Aunt?

1459
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,744
Hey Aunt? Aunt?

1460
01:16:52,076 --> 01:16:53,006
Aunt?

1461
01:16:56,698 --> 01:16:59,159
I was saying,
- "O sister, you..."

1462
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:03,698
what about payment?
- "Give me salvation."

1463
01:17:03,778 --> 01:17:05,231
Hey, Debashish?
- "O sister..."

1464
01:17:05,311 --> 01:17:07,469
Keep a note of this song...

1465
01:17:07,549 --> 01:17:09,179
"Give me salvation..."
- I can incorporate it later.

1466
01:17:09,259 --> 01:17:10,477
"O mine...."
- Keep this horizontally.

1467
01:17:10,557 --> 01:17:11,929
The head should be there.

1468
01:17:12,009 --> 01:17:16,436
Listen, I was wondering,
let's talk with Subir,

1469
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:19,369
and keep the camera
at an elevated level.

1470
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:22,451
Then...
- Don't I need to get on the pyre?

1471
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,322
Why did you come?
No, no, I was saying,

1472
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:27,269
I'm using the dummy for this shot.

1473
01:17:27,349 --> 01:17:28,709
You don't need to.

1474
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:30,239
Please sit.
- No, no

1475
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:31,982
You don't need all that dummy.

1476
01:17:32,062 --> 01:17:33,507
Put me on the pyre.

1477
01:17:33,922 --> 01:17:37,163
Who can experience
such a thing alive?

1478
01:17:37,545 --> 01:17:39,538
I'm not losing this chance.

1479
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:40,949
Can you do it?

1480
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:43,195
Of course.
- You need to keep your eyes closed.

1481
01:17:43,911 --> 01:17:45,446
And stop your breath as well.
Can you do it?

1482
01:17:45,526 --> 01:17:47,203
Just check if I can.

1483
01:17:47,283 --> 01:17:49,939
I'll anyway be on
the pire in a few days.

1484
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:51,739
This might be a rehearsal.

1485
01:17:53,015 --> 01:17:55,947
Okay, fine, let's go. Debashish?
- Yes.

1486
01:17:56,341 --> 01:17:59,641
But that one year had
helped me in a different way.

1487
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:00,974
How so?

1488
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:04,439
Growing up in a city,
the rural lifestyle,

1489
01:18:04,519 --> 01:18:07,413
and the customs were
something I had no idea about.

1490
01:18:09,442 --> 01:18:11,902
But in this one year,
for making Chandra Seth,

1491
01:18:11,982 --> 01:18:13,837
I had to go to the Saral
village a lot of times.

1492
01:18:14,246 --> 01:18:15,195
Thus,

1493
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:19,190
the real character of rural Bangla,

1494
01:18:19,484 --> 01:18:24,794
and their mannerisms, lifestyle,
and a million other things,

1495
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:26,801
I was enriched by that.

1496
01:18:27,396 --> 01:18:30,754
And their excitement was palpable.

1497
01:18:31,038 --> 01:18:34,873
Brother Apu,
so we are starting 21/B, right?

1498
01:18:35,718 --> 01:18:38,769
So Debashish, I had an idea.

1499
01:18:39,035 --> 01:18:40,026
Yes?

1500
01:18:40,496 --> 01:18:41,940
I need a bald head.

1501
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:44,911
Bald head?
- Yes, bald head.

1502
01:18:45,685 --> 01:18:48,439
See, I wanted,
in the starting of the rainy scene,

1503
01:18:48,904 --> 01:18:52,198
the first drop would fall
on the bald head of a man,

1504
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,659
who was catching fish by the pond.

1505
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:56,767
How would that be?

1506
01:18:57,387 --> 01:18:58,565
Good idea.

1507
01:18:58,923 --> 01:19:00,169
Should I call Sunil?
- Yeah, yeah.

1508
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:01,296
Sunil?
- Hey Sunil?

1509
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:02,908
Come here, please.
- Yeah, brother Apu.

1510
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,549
I want a bald man.

1511
01:19:04,629 --> 01:19:05,930
Bald?
- Bald man, bald.

1512
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:06,939
Okay, let me see.

1513
01:19:07,019 --> 01:19:09,721
Brother, please come here once.

1514
01:19:10,438 --> 01:19:13,253
Do you have any bald-headed
man in your village?

1515
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:15,799
Of course,
is there any dearth of bald men?

1516
01:19:15,879 --> 01:19:17,999
Wow, can you call someone like that?

1517
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:19,712
Of course, he's right here.

1518
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,021
Hey Kartik?

1519
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:23,702
Here, will he do?

1520
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:25,182
Yeah.

1521
01:19:25,589 --> 01:19:29,018
I saw a bald man, of your village,

1522
01:19:29,378 --> 01:19:31,179
and he was perfect.

1523
01:19:31,259 --> 01:19:32,521
Do you know the name?

1524
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,658
Name?

1525
01:19:34,787 --> 01:19:36,089
I don't know the name.

1526
01:19:36,169 --> 01:19:38,119
Then, how would I look for him?

1527
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:40,432
Right. How would you know?

1528
01:19:40,512 --> 01:19:42,389
Listen, give me a paper and pen.

1529
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:44,415
Do it on the blank page. Here.

1530
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:51,659
No. no.

1531
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,353
See.

1532
01:20:04,558 --> 01:20:06,049
This is Haru, the washer-man.

1533
01:20:06,329 --> 01:20:07,473
Yes, yes. Haru, the washer-man
- That does it, call him.

1534
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,969
Do you know him?
- Yes.

1535
01:20:09,049 --> 01:20:10,109
Please call him then.
- Call him.

1536
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:12,588
Go and call Haru, the washer-man.
- Such a perfect drawing.

1537
01:20:12,868 --> 01:20:14,489
Wow, just amazing.

1538
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:15,886
Bald,

1539
01:20:16,524 --> 01:20:18,320
What bald head? Tak Duma Dum Dum.

1540
01:20:19,007 --> 01:20:20,179
Brother Apu, come, let's go.
- Let's go.

1541
01:20:20,259 --> 01:20:21,710
Okay?
- One second.

1542
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:24,670
It should be on the centre.

1543
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,299
Here, right? Here.

1544
01:20:26,379 --> 01:20:27,749
Come, let's go?

1545
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:29,629
Roll camera?
- Rolling.

1546
01:20:29,709 --> 01:20:32,663
Pather Padabali, scene 54/1, take 4.
- Action.

1547
01:20:34,181 --> 01:20:35,093
Cut, cut, cut.

1548
01:20:35,173 --> 01:20:38,229
Debashish, just one drop
and exactly at that point.

1549
01:20:38,309 --> 01:20:39,649
Okay.
- In the centre.

1550
01:20:39,729 --> 01:20:41,531
Once more, I'm doing it once more.

1551
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:42,958
Is it ready?
- Give it to me.

1552
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:43,878
Yes.

1553
01:20:44,289 --> 01:20:46,749
Please keep the head down, okay?

1554
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,089
I'm out of frame, right?

1555
01:20:48,169 --> 01:20:50,018
Yes, raise your hand a little.
- Okay?

1556
01:20:50,098 --> 01:20:51,929
Yea, fine.
- Fine, right?

1557
01:20:52,419 --> 01:20:53,889
Come.
- Roll camera.

1558
01:20:54,094 --> 01:20:57,099
Rolling. Pather Padabali,
scene 54/1, take five.

1559
01:20:57,923 --> 01:20:58,886
Going.

1560
01:21:10,104 --> 01:21:12,321
The first drop of rain,

1561
01:21:12,745 --> 01:21:14,694
starting from that dramatic scene,

1562
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:18,232
to the huge rain scene,

1563
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:20,035
which you created,

1564
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:23,638
I am very interested to know
the story of its building.

1565
01:21:24,771 --> 01:21:25,795
I heard,

1566
01:21:26,078 --> 01:21:28,409
this was the first time in world,

1567
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:30,554
and most probably just once,

1568
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:32,449
the actual rain

1569
01:21:32,903 --> 01:21:36,016
was used in an actual rain scene.

1570
01:21:36,397 --> 01:21:38,765
See, I can't talk
of the whole world,

1571
01:21:38,845 --> 01:21:40,296
but I can assure you,

1572
01:21:40,902 --> 01:21:43,257
in our nation, before this movie,

1573
01:21:43,603 --> 01:21:46,051
outdoor shooting
was not so prevalent.

1574
01:21:46,738 --> 01:21:49,448
And rain was a main
subject of our film.

1575
01:21:49,873 --> 01:21:51,962
And that has to happen outdoor.

1576
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:53,592
So, no choice but to wait for rain.

1577
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:57,132
Yes, like the Jacobin cuckoo,
we waited for rains for two days.

1578
01:21:57,429 --> 01:21:59,302
There's no sign of rains.

1579
01:22:00,099 --> 01:22:03,597
And the wait had tired my unit too.

1580
01:22:04,084 --> 01:22:06,325
But the day the rains came,

1581
01:22:06,865 --> 01:22:11,293
due to an important office work,
I couldn't do the shooting.

1582
01:22:11,373 --> 01:22:14,816
Subir, Chandra and the
others did the shooting that day.

1583
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:15,973
Debashish?
- Yes?

1584
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:17,400
Come here once.

1585
01:22:19,038 --> 01:22:20,289
Subir?
- Yes?

1586
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,305
Subir?

1587
01:22:21,385 --> 01:22:22,333
Yes?
- Come here.

1588
01:22:22,413 --> 01:22:24,929
See, Apu wanted a frame like this.

1589
01:22:25,009 --> 01:22:26,974
I mean...
- Yeah, got it.

1590
01:22:27,054 --> 01:22:29,839
But will the centre compass
look good in whiteshot?

1591
01:22:29,919 --> 01:22:31,834
Wouldn't it be better
if it were a little off center?

1592
01:22:32,146 --> 01:22:33,839
But this is exactly
what he scribbled.

1593
01:22:34,063 --> 01:22:36,910
Else when the girl's hair swings,
it will go out of frame.

1594
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:40,226
When she'll be staring at the sky,
we should take a closer.

1595
01:22:40,306 --> 01:22:41,569
Hey, you are sitting
here and there...

1596
01:22:41,649 --> 01:22:45,589
Come, come,
it will rain, brother Janak, quick!

1597
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,469
Yeah, yeah, go there, call him.

1598
01:22:48,549 --> 01:22:50,507
You can't trust rains.

1599
01:22:50,587 --> 01:22:51,794
Hold this.
- Take this.

1600
01:22:51,874 --> 01:22:53,613
Quickly, put it back.

1601
01:22:53,693 --> 01:22:55,819
What happened?

1602
01:22:55,899 --> 01:22:59,103
Hey, hey, hold that.
- Hold it on outside.

1603
01:22:59,983 --> 01:23:02,539
Come, come. Take it there, there.

1604
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:04,831
Yeah, yeah... take it to the front.

1605
01:23:04,911 --> 01:23:06,946
Hey, brother, where are you going?

1606
01:23:07,026 --> 01:23:08,132
Come, come.

1607
01:23:08,212 --> 01:23:09,638
Be quick.

1608
01:23:12,143 --> 01:23:14,909
Listen, run there, and come here.

1609
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:16,829
Okay, okay.

1610
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,229
Camera rolling? Right, to the right.

1611
01:23:19,309 --> 01:23:21,489
Turn around, turn around? Yes.

1612
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:38,209
Yeah, fine, that's fine.

1613
01:23:38,289 --> 01:23:39,416
Feeling cold?
- What?

1614
01:23:39,496 --> 01:23:41,827
Feeling cold? Shawl, shawl...

1615
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:43,127
Give her the umbrella.

1616
01:23:43,207 --> 01:23:45,991
Yeah, do it like this, yes.
- Yes, yes.

1617
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:49,639
Softly, softly, don't fall.

1618
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:51,433
Softly, yes.

1619
01:23:52,332 --> 01:23:54,785
Yeah, cover him.

1620
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:57,124
Hold your brother, hold him.

1621
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:58,728
Hold your brother.

1622
01:23:58,808 --> 01:24:00,297
And then...

1623
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:05,343
Subir?
- Yeah.

1624
01:24:05,423 --> 01:24:07,572
Got it?
- Yeah, I'm almost there, almost...

1625
01:24:07,652 --> 01:24:10,760
"Rain, rain, go away..
Come again, another day..."

1626
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,154
"Rain, rain, go away...
Come again, another day.."

1627
01:24:13,234 --> 01:24:15,146
"Rain, rain, go away...
Come again, another day.."

1628
01:24:15,226 --> 01:24:16,799
"Rain, rain, go away...
Come again, another day.."

1629
01:24:16,879 --> 01:24:18,732
This is a very interesting story.

1630
01:24:19,276 --> 01:24:21,599
So, we know,

1631
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:24,437
that shooting is another
name of austerity.

1632
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:26,098
But,

1633
01:24:26,385 --> 01:24:29,971
there are a lot of interesting
incidents there.

1634
01:24:30,296 --> 01:24:33,284
And we, the outsiders,
never know of that.

1635
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:35,604
If you're reminded
of any such incident?

1636
01:24:36,078 --> 01:24:38,106
There are many such incidents.

1637
01:24:38,186 --> 01:24:40,768
For example,
Srinivas, the sweet-seller,

1638
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:44,214
Seeing the water reflection scene,
a gentleman thought,

1639
01:24:44,294 --> 01:24:45,877
it was printed in
reverse by mistake.

1640
01:24:47,563 --> 01:24:49,783
Behind Srinivas and Uma and Manik,

1641
01:24:50,024 --> 01:24:51,587
and the dog following them.

1642
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:56,183
It was a huge trouble
to take this shot.

1643
01:24:56,655 --> 01:24:59,162
There's the reflection, yes.

1644
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:01,715
Is there a telephone nearby?

1645
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:04,346
Telephone? In this remote village?

1646
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:06,574
Have you lost it? And why?

1647
01:25:07,671 --> 01:25:09,625
Babushona is not well since morning.

1648
01:25:11,477 --> 01:25:13,017
Why did you come today?

1649
01:25:13,097 --> 01:25:14,447
You could have come any other day.

1650
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,072
I don't want to miss this shooting.

1651
01:25:17,298 --> 01:25:19,051
But where would you
find the telephone now?

1652
01:25:19,893 --> 01:25:22,279
You might find it in the
post office, but that's quite far.

1653
01:25:23,103 --> 01:25:25,308
Mother is at home.
She'll surely handle it.

1654
01:25:25,388 --> 01:25:27,080
Now let me concentrate on this shot.

1655
01:25:28,147 --> 01:25:29,506
It has both kids and animal.

1656
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:31,596
A dangerous situation,
just wait right here.

1657
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:33,416
Hey, are you done?
- Replay it.

1658
01:25:34,169 --> 01:25:37,185
Debashish? The dog's waiting.

1659
01:25:38,652 --> 01:25:39,692
Debashish, can you hear me?

1660
01:25:39,772 --> 01:25:40,793
Here, say it.

1661
01:25:41,813 --> 01:25:43,610
Debashish, can you hear me?
- Yes, brother Apu.

1662
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:45,591
The dog's waiting.

1663
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:47,355
And he loves you.

1664
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:48,551
Get him up.

1665
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:51,098
And get them on position.

1666
01:25:51,178 --> 01:25:52,725
Okay, fine.
- Bring them back.

1667
01:25:53,312 --> 01:25:54,143
Hey, Subir...
- Yeah.

1668
01:25:54,223 --> 01:25:56,697
Brother Apu, one second, I just
thought of an interesting thing.

1669
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,009
Let me do the composition.

1670
01:25:58,089 --> 01:26:00,009
Tilt down, tilt down.

1671
01:26:00,089 --> 01:26:01,609
Move, move.

1672
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:02,860
Yes.
- Yeah, I see the reflection.

1673
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:03,909
See, brother Apu.

1674
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:07,955
Take the camera to that side.
It'll go there.

1675
01:26:08,035 --> 01:26:09,817
Yeah, the reflection's better there.

1676
01:26:14,713 --> 01:26:16,429
Are you only trying
to get the reflection?

1677
01:26:16,509 --> 01:26:17,327
Yes.
- Good frame, here.

1678
01:26:17,407 --> 01:26:18,526
Yes, check that.

1679
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:19,801
Then let's do this,

1680
01:26:20,825 --> 01:26:23,080
we'll plan the master differently.

1681
01:26:23,586 --> 01:26:24,623
Okay?
- Yes.

1682
01:26:24,703 --> 01:26:26,749
Hey, come, let's go.
- Careful, careful.

1683
01:26:26,829 --> 01:26:28,095
Brother Apu, just coming.

1684
01:26:28,175 --> 01:26:29,309
Yes, careful.

1685
01:26:29,389 --> 01:26:30,688
Okay, okay?

1686
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:32,960
Let's go.
- Yeah. Then let's go.

1687
01:26:33,844 --> 01:26:34,651
There are three locks,

1688
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,939
open the first one.
- Okay, roll sound.

1689
01:26:36,465 --> 01:26:37,968
One second, let's go.

1690
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:39,136
Roll camera.

1691
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,714
Rolling.

1692
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:43,432
Pather Padabali, scene 22, take one.

1693
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:46,121
And action.

1694
01:26:48,285 --> 01:26:49,729
Follow him, follow.

1695
01:26:49,809 --> 01:26:51,496
Come, come.

1696
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:00,643
Cut, cut, cut.

1697
01:27:01,298 --> 01:27:03,013
The dog's not moving, ask him to go.

1698
01:27:06,835 --> 01:27:08,616
Apu?
- Yes? Wait.

1699
01:27:08,995 --> 01:27:10,444
Hold this, what?

1700
01:27:11,134 --> 01:27:14,229
Give the girl something in her hand,
that'll attract the dog.

1701
01:27:14,309 --> 01:27:15,519
Food? Yes, right.

1702
01:27:15,599 --> 01:27:16,823
Hey, listen.

1703
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:19,307
Give her some sweets
from the sweet pot.

1704
01:27:19,387 --> 01:27:20,449
Damn!

1705
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:21,590
Sweets will cause him
to lose his fur.

1706
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,533
Something plain,
biscuits or something.

1707
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,595
Something...
- Man, he'll lose fur.

1708
01:27:25,675 --> 01:27:27,203
Hey, give it.

1709
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:29,489
Do you have some biscuits?

1710
01:27:29,569 --> 01:27:31,466
Yes.
- Give it to Devi.

1711
01:27:32,019 --> 01:27:34,351
Ask her to show that,
so the dog will follow.

1712
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:35,824
Okay.
- Will the reflection work?

1713
01:27:35,904 --> 01:27:37,182
Yes, yes.
- Then, fine.

1714
01:27:37,262 --> 01:27:39,473
Mr. Kartik...

1715
01:27:39,759 --> 01:27:41,534
Come, come, let's go.

1716
01:27:41,818 --> 01:27:43,379
Should we go?
- Should we go?

1717
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:45,449
Roll camera.
- Rolling.

1718
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:47,725
Pather Padabali, scene 22, take 10.

1719
01:27:48,324 --> 01:27:49,465
Action.

1720
01:28:06,945 --> 01:28:08,789
And cut it, excellent.

1721
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:10,315
Excellent, excellent shot.

1722
01:28:11,001 --> 01:28:12,573
Great!
- Oh, man!

1723
01:28:13,024 --> 01:28:14,490
Thank God, Sarameya.

1724
01:28:14,867 --> 01:28:16,909
One shot made me sweat bullets.

1725
01:28:16,989 --> 01:28:18,129
Thank you.

1726
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:20,234
Hey listen, give him some biscuits.

1727
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:21,768
He deserves it.

1728
01:28:23,828 --> 01:28:25,209
And then there was another problem.

1729
01:28:26,141 --> 01:28:28,772
The duty of waking
Manimala Devi at dawn,

1730
01:28:29,094 --> 01:28:33,107
and escorting her to shooting spot,
was given to a Punjabi driver.

1731
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,183
He didn't have the alarm clock.

1732
01:28:35,558 --> 01:28:37,412
So he made up a solution himself.

1733
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:52,522
What's happening here?

1734
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:55,069
Hey brother?

1735
01:28:55,149 --> 01:28:57,300
Why did you stop the car
at Tram line? Are you an idiot?

1736
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,449
Sorry, a mistake.
- A idiot.

1737
01:28:58,529 --> 01:28:59,453
Forgive me.
- What can I even say?

1738
01:28:59,533 --> 01:29:02,834
He stopped the car at tram line
and is snoring away, move it.

1739
01:29:03,306 --> 01:29:04,819
Quick.
- Yeah, I'm leaving.

1740
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:09,237
Later, Sajjan Singh came
to an understanding with them.

1741
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:11,529
He used to keep the car
next to tram line.

1742
01:29:11,609 --> 01:29:14,638
And while passing, they would
ring the bell and wake him up.

1743
01:29:16,294 --> 01:29:19,705
Oh, my door is open.
Don't do roaming around in noon.

1744
01:29:20,183 --> 01:29:23,976
Keep in mind and cook some rice for
yourself, and something for Mini.

1745
01:29:24,056 --> 01:29:26,180
Don't forget it.

1746
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:29,474
Wait.

1747
01:29:48,362 --> 01:29:50,646
Outdoor shooting
is somehow finished.

1748
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:53,711
After this the biggest
challenge for us was...

1749
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:58,143
to construct the Manik's
house on the set as it is.

1750
01:29:58,603 --> 01:30:00,503
So, this is the plan. Okay?

1751
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:01,946
This is Harimadhav's entire house.

1752
01:30:02,558 --> 01:30:04,536
And this door is this one in here.

1753
01:30:04,768 --> 01:30:06,045
And what is the name
of that old woman?

1754
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:07,509
Nonibala.
- Nonibala.

1755
01:30:07,589 --> 01:30:09,254
Even Nonibala will sit right here.

1756
01:30:09,334 --> 01:30:11,892
The rest you can figure out.
- You have done a good job.

1757
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:13,674
We'll get so much space.

1758
01:30:14,065 --> 01:30:17,426
Yes, it'll be easier for me to place
trolleys, lights, etc. as well.

1759
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,548
The pillars would
be made of wood. Right?

1760
01:30:20,628 --> 01:30:22,054
Yes. Definitely.

1761
01:30:22,134 --> 01:30:24,869
And I'll make a 'Kalongi'
in the house.

1762
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:25,934
'Kalongi?'

1763
01:30:26,014 --> 01:30:28,243
Hey!
- It looks something like this.

1764
01:30:29,987 --> 01:30:32,209
Where we keep Lord Ganpati.

1765
01:30:32,598 --> 01:30:34,451
'Kulungi'?
- 'Kulungi' isn't it?

1766
01:30:34,531 --> 01:30:35,469
Kulungi.

1767
01:30:35,549 --> 01:30:36,759
I couldn't even figure it out.

1768
01:30:36,839 --> 01:30:38,563
That the Manik's house
was constructed on the set.

1769
01:30:39,044 --> 01:30:40,543
See, I don't think much people

1770
01:30:40,623 --> 01:30:43,563
outside the production
unit could figure that out.

1771
01:30:43,994 --> 01:30:47,044
But all the credit
goes to our art director,

1772
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:48,793
Chandragupta Kichlu.

1773
01:30:49,164 --> 01:30:52,548
Not only the detailed
set construction...

1774
01:30:52,896 --> 01:30:55,708
in some cases, if it weren't
for a few improvisations,

1775
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:58,311
this masterpiece would
not have been possible.

1776
01:30:58,754 --> 01:31:01,479
For example, in Saral,
the door in the real location,

1777
01:31:01,559 --> 01:31:02,958
the lower part of the door
is broken and withered.

1778
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:06,098
As the weathering techniques
we have here is not too good.

1779
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:07,893
And it wouldn't have
been realistic as well.

1780
01:31:08,098 --> 01:31:13,146
Chandra studied set construction
and he innovated...

1781
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:15,109
by bringing such an effect,

1782
01:31:15,189 --> 01:31:19,372
which made it impossible to
figure out if that is real or fake.

1783
01:31:19,452 --> 01:31:21,516
We are left with a doubt.

1784
01:31:21,966 --> 01:31:23,585
Even after having a house
in the real location,

1785
01:31:24,262 --> 01:31:28,371
why did you have to construct
it later on the set to shoot?

1786
01:31:28,619 --> 01:31:29,649
We don't have the lightings

1787
01:31:29,729 --> 01:31:33,914
required to shoot night scenes
in outdoor locations.

1788
01:31:34,219 --> 01:31:38,160
On this context, I would
like to tell our cameraman Subir

1789
01:31:39,529 --> 01:31:41,509
He has made some
miraculous innovations

1790
01:31:41,589 --> 01:31:43,149
regarding the lighting
systems in that movie.

1791
01:31:44,025 --> 01:31:46,771
That is literary revolutionary.

1792
01:31:47,951 --> 01:31:49,520
Not only in our country.

1793
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,275
I have rarely seen

1794
01:31:51,355 --> 01:31:54,488
the natural lights of that
sort even in foreign movies.

1795
01:31:55,295 --> 01:31:58,895
He didn't let the light
fall directly on the actor.

1796
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:01,118
He used to bounce it on them.

1797
01:32:01,499 --> 01:32:03,624
Just how it happens in real.

1798
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:06,750
This camera work of Subir.

1799
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,993
Changed the World cinema in itself.

1800
01:32:09,073 --> 01:32:10,754
A little back, a little back.

1801
01:32:10,834 --> 01:32:12,419
Yes, yes. That is the last.

1802
01:32:12,499 --> 01:32:14,179
Give me the mark.
- Okay, fine.

1803
01:32:14,259 --> 01:32:15,394
Do you need this light?

1804
01:32:15,474 --> 01:32:17,140
Should I turn on this light?
- We'll rehearse once.

1805
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,056
About this fan, Brother.
- That light...

1806
01:32:19,136 --> 01:32:20,729
Put it up.
- Come on, push the trolley.

1807
01:32:20,809 --> 01:32:21,919
We'll do it with dialogues.

1808
01:32:21,999 --> 01:32:23,509
The brick, fast.

1809
01:32:23,589 --> 01:32:26,139
Keep moving. Come on...

1810
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:27,903
Have you ever boarded a train?
- Hey, brother Apu?

1811
01:32:28,789 --> 01:32:29,669
Yes, you give it.

1812
01:32:29,749 --> 01:32:30,842
Brother Apu,
we would need a light in that room.

1813
01:32:30,922 --> 01:32:31,739
It's looking pretty dark.

1814
01:32:31,819 --> 01:32:32,686
Keep it there.

1815
01:32:32,766 --> 01:32:33,860
This is the last position.
- That's it.

1816
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,226
We just need a light
in that room right there.

1817
01:32:35,306 --> 01:32:36,351
Okay.

1818
01:32:36,769 --> 01:32:38,769
It seems dark in there.
- You all take some rest.

1819
01:32:38,849 --> 01:32:41,726
Hey Jhontu? Hey Jhontu?

1820
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:44,269
Why have you kept this light here?
Keep it behind the door.

1821
01:32:44,349 --> 01:32:45,409
Make the light bounce.

1822
01:32:45,489 --> 01:32:47,439
There is no space here, sir.

1823
01:32:47,519 --> 01:32:49,820
Oh, no! Is there really no space?

1824
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,552
Wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah, here.

1825
01:32:51,854 --> 01:32:54,698
Do one thing.
The truck that we have.

1826
01:32:55,088 --> 01:32:56,559
Get a headlight from the truck.

1827
01:32:57,899 --> 01:32:59,169
Bring the battery too.

1828
01:32:59,249 --> 01:33:02,199
And keep it inside that pot.

1829
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:04,877
Go, go, quick!
- I'll just get it.

1830
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:08,137
Hey brother, get the light.

1831
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:11,409
Okay, sir?

1832
01:33:11,489 --> 01:33:12,680
Wow, good!

1833
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,797
Pather Padabali,
scene 37, take four.

1834
01:33:15,718 --> 01:33:17,344
And action.

1835
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:19,009
Trolley.

1836
01:33:19,313 --> 01:33:20,904
You heard the train outside.

1837
01:33:21,999 --> 01:33:23,097
Tell your sister.

1838
01:33:23,661 --> 01:33:24,711
Sister?
- Yes?

1839
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:25,989
Have you seen a train?

1840
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:28,759
Yes.
- Pure rubbish.

1841
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:31,250
Do you know where the train line is?
- There.

1842
01:33:31,789 --> 01:33:35,127
Saral danga ground,
then wheat fields, then rail line.

1843
01:33:35,207 --> 01:33:36,557
Will you go once?
- Sure.

1844
01:33:36,637 --> 01:33:37,548
Mr Bhanu.

1845
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:40,031
Show me what you wrote, dear?

1846
01:33:41,862 --> 01:33:43,786
Wow, quite good.

1847
01:33:44,154 --> 01:33:46,006
Now write 'Oibhoot'.

1848
01:33:46,343 --> 01:33:47,604
Oh, God!

1849
01:33:49,579 --> 01:33:52,923
A demoness came then,

1850
01:33:53,587 --> 01:33:56,447
"Hau Mau Khau"

1851
01:33:57,142 --> 01:33:59,817
Who's the human I smell?

1852
01:34:00,486 --> 01:34:03,425
Who lies awake in my temple?

1853
01:34:03,505 --> 01:34:07,304
Neelkamal sleeps
and Lalkamal lays awake.

1854
01:34:07,951 --> 01:34:11,499
And then, during noon,

1855
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,629
the demoness came again.

1856
01:34:14,032 --> 01:34:16,549
"Hau, Mau, Khau..."

1857
01:34:16,629 --> 01:34:19,470
Who is the human I smell?

1858
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:22,453
Who lies awake in my temple?

1859
01:34:22,533 --> 01:34:24,742
Give me the news...
- Uma?

1860
01:34:25,265 --> 01:34:26,465
Let's go.

1861
01:34:29,751 --> 01:34:31,379
Go, go.

1862
01:34:31,459 --> 01:34:32,656
Mr. Aparajito?

1863
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:35,698
I'm very curious about one scene,

1864
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:38,754
an unforgettable scene.

1865
01:34:39,489 --> 01:34:43,019
Harimadhav is returning
home after Uma's death.

1866
01:34:43,338 --> 01:34:44,467
Without knowing anything,

1867
01:34:44,985 --> 01:34:47,642
Sarvamangala is informing him.

1868
01:34:48,027 --> 01:34:50,011
The frame...

1869
01:34:51,622 --> 01:34:53,119
I am thinking it like this.

1870
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:56,302
This is the frame.

1871
01:34:56,851 --> 01:34:58,699
Sarvamangala is standing here,

1872
01:34:58,779 --> 01:35:00,469
and Harimadhav is sitting here.

1873
01:35:00,549 --> 01:35:01,639
See, Subir.

1874
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:04,842
Do you want topish?
- A little topish, 50?

1875
01:35:06,508 --> 01:35:07,697
Maybe 35.

1876
01:35:09,242 --> 01:35:10,186
Is Tarpa here?

1877
01:35:10,266 --> 01:35:11,447
Subir just went to get them,
they'll be here.

1878
01:35:11,527 --> 01:35:13,352
Listen, there was a storm.

1879
01:35:13,432 --> 01:35:15,218
So the straw on top,

1880
01:35:15,487 --> 01:35:18,336
I am reducing it a little.

1881
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:21,252
Yes, just a little,
don't make it a cyclone.

1882
01:35:22,189 --> 01:35:25,814
And the props to be kept inside
Harimadhav's bag, are they ready?

1883
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:28,147
Yes, everything is checked.

1884
01:35:28,227 --> 01:35:30,221
That's like Chandragupta Kichlu.

1885
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:32,699
Debashish, get the artist
ready with their lines.

1886
01:35:32,779 --> 01:35:34,589
Magazine?
- Up, up.

1887
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:37,089
Get up, get on the roof.

1888
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:38,854
Yes.
- Put him there.

1889
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:39,781
Here, here.
- Okay.

1890
01:35:39,861 --> 01:35:41,368
If you put it up,
I'll put Harimadhav there.

1891
01:35:41,448 --> 01:35:43,539
Do you want Harimadhav there? Then..
- Yeah, where is Tarpa?

1892
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:44,787
Hey, brother.

1893
01:35:44,867 --> 01:35:46,199
Hey Tarpa, this is bigger than me.

1894
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:48,505
Bring it here.
- Let me see.

1895
01:35:48,585 --> 01:35:51,438
I already told Apu,
I'm not good with crying.

1896
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:54,078
You need a professional
actor for that.

1897
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:55,569
Why are you worrying?

1898
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,013
He'll surely get it done.

1899
01:35:57,578 --> 01:35:59,639
Would you please check the props?

1900
01:35:59,719 --> 01:36:01,299
When you'll take it out of your bag,

1901
01:36:01,379 --> 01:36:03,861
when you take out the saree,
she'll cry holding that.

1902
01:36:03,941 --> 01:36:06,636
Okay?
- Bring Mr Harimadhav's props.

1903
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:31,849
Man, couldn't it have
been green for a while longer,

1904
01:36:34,733 --> 01:36:36,869
Here, from the Charak fair,

1905
01:36:36,949 --> 01:36:38,587
genuine Jackfruit wood.

1906
01:36:38,933 --> 01:36:41,060
And you wanted a plate for Lakshmi.

1907
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:44,202
Here, I got it framed in glass.

1908
01:36:45,969 --> 01:36:49,649
And this, for my dear Uma.

1909
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:51,582
A saree.

1910
01:37:00,701 --> 01:37:01,529
What happened?

1911
01:37:02,804 --> 01:37:03,748
What happened?

1912
01:37:05,197 --> 01:37:06,269
Not happening.

1913
01:37:07,351 --> 01:37:08,169
Cut it, cut it.

1914
01:37:08,249 --> 01:37:09,419
Let's do it again, quickly.

1915
01:37:09,499 --> 01:37:11,148
No, I know, it's not working.

1916
01:37:11,578 --> 01:37:14,055
As I told you, I can't cry.

1917
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:16,522
Give me 5 minutes please.

1918
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:23,351
Another camera.

1919
01:37:24,029 --> 01:37:26,240
What to do?
- Let me see, reset the props.

1920
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,933
Let me see.
- Sure.

1921
01:37:28,522 --> 01:37:29,568
Come.

1922
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:32,668
Varuna, any problem?

1923
01:37:33,893 --> 01:37:35,433
Problem, for sure.

1924
01:37:35,872 --> 01:37:38,093
I'm wasting so many camera reels.

1925
01:37:38,173 --> 01:37:41,743
Actually,
as I told you, I just can't cry.

1926
01:37:41,823 --> 01:37:44,116
You don't need to worry,
you are doing good.

1927
01:37:44,196 --> 01:37:45,944
It's just about tears, right?

1928
01:37:46,024 --> 01:37:48,184
You just need to stare
at the sun for that.

1929
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:49,997
Even Mr. Bhanu was saying,

1930
01:37:50,077 --> 01:37:52,313
you just need to press
a gland to cry tears.

1931
01:37:52,764 --> 01:37:54,624
Tears are fine,

1932
01:37:54,704 --> 01:37:58,463
but the shock,
that needs to come from within.

1933
01:37:58,543 --> 01:38:00,183
And I just can't feel that.

1934
01:38:00,263 --> 01:38:02,320
What are Stanislavski's
opinions on that?

1935
01:38:03,028 --> 01:38:03,950
Nothing.

1936
01:38:04,353 --> 01:38:05,991
Method acting fail.

1937
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:07,921
How about we try a Bangla method?

1938
01:38:08,835 --> 01:38:09,657
Okay.
- Let's go.

1939
01:38:09,737 --> 01:38:11,116
And a saree for Uma.

1940
01:38:11,428 --> 01:38:13,330
See, look at that.

1941
01:38:35,052 --> 01:38:36,217
Cut.

1942
01:38:37,131 --> 01:38:38,483
Great, amazing.

1943
01:38:38,563 --> 01:38:39,904
Mr. Bhanu, amazing.

1944
01:38:40,133 --> 01:38:41,515
Really, was it good?

1945
01:38:41,852 --> 01:38:44,163
Thank you, so relieved.

1946
01:38:44,243 --> 01:38:46,101
Good, good!

1947
01:38:46,303 --> 01:38:49,311
It was very necessary to
evoke emotions in this scene.

1948
01:38:49,553 --> 01:38:52,123
I was a bit apprehensive
while watching this scene.

1949
01:38:52,473 --> 01:38:56,491
But when the scene was complete,
with music, it felt

1950
01:38:56,768 --> 01:38:59,580
if we left out Sarvamangala's
heart-piercing cry

1951
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:01,913
completely from the scene,

1952
01:39:02,184 --> 01:39:04,853
and just use wired Shehnai,

1953
01:39:04,933 --> 01:39:08,775
it will be better for the emotions
I'm trying to achieve.

1954
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:12,892
And it will make the scene
more telling and poignant,

1955
01:39:13,285 --> 01:39:15,403
without being
unnecessarily sentimental.

1956
01:39:37,786 --> 01:39:38,855
Amazing. Amazing!

1957
01:39:38,935 --> 01:39:40,173
Wow, great!

1958
01:39:40,393 --> 01:39:41,973
The impact you are looking for.

1959
01:39:42,053 --> 01:39:45,275
This Raga 'Patdeep' that you played,
is much more impactful.

1960
01:39:45,703 --> 01:39:49,477
And the ones you played before,
Purya Dhanshri, Todi,

1961
01:39:49,832 --> 01:39:51,936
these are good but very common.

1962
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:55,953
Okay, Mr. Surya,
let's do the rain sequence now.

1963
01:39:56,033 --> 01:40:01,521
Yes, but I am not using
'Malhaar' in rain seqeunce.

1964
01:40:01,907 --> 01:40:03,638
Rather, I am...

1965
01:40:04,662 --> 01:40:06,384
using 'Desh' Raga here.

1966
01:40:33,019 --> 01:40:36,678
Wow, this is quite celebratory.
Can we hear it whole?

1967
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,958
It goes great with the theme too.

1968
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,656
Mr. Aparajito,

1969
01:41:27,736 --> 01:41:30,633
it is virtually impossible
to finish it in such little time.

1970
01:41:30,713 --> 01:41:34,069
And with your busy schedule, you
can't even give us more than a day.

1971
01:41:34,149 --> 01:41:35,423
That's true.

1972
01:41:35,503 --> 01:41:37,634
But with the tight
deadlines you have,

1973
01:41:37,714 --> 01:41:40,803
and you also want
the music to match the scene.

1974
01:41:40,883 --> 01:41:43,169
Okay, okay, do a thing.

1975
01:41:43,249 --> 01:41:45,833
Just play the musical
pieces a bit longer.

1976
01:41:46,264 --> 01:41:50,459
I will cut and use it
as per the scene needs.

1977
01:41:50,539 --> 01:41:55,702
We had to finish the music in
tremendous hurry, in just 11 hours.

1978
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:57,693
But it was still
lacking in few places.

1979
01:41:57,773 --> 01:41:59,759
For example, the sweet-seller scene.

1980
01:42:00,273 --> 01:42:02,123
Luckily, Subir can play Sitar.

1981
01:42:03,331 --> 01:42:06,004
But this pressure,
of fighting against time,

1982
01:42:06,465 --> 01:42:07,616
didn't spare us.

1983
01:42:07,903 --> 01:42:09,534
And Morgan Wheeler
came during this time,

1984
01:42:10,113 --> 01:42:14,062
who's one of the directors
of New York's Museum of Modern arts.

1985
01:42:14,483 --> 01:42:17,223
He had somehow heard of our movie.

1986
01:42:17,723 --> 01:42:19,981
The movie was not
fit to be shown then.

1987
01:42:20,251 --> 01:42:22,960
So we had to make
do with shooting stills.

1988
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,543
No, no,
this is such a silly painting.

1989
01:42:25,623 --> 01:42:27,855
Here, these are the photographs.

1990
01:42:27,935 --> 01:42:28,933
Have a look.

1991
01:42:30,446 --> 01:42:31,776
I must say,

1992
01:42:32,765 --> 01:42:34,944
They don't look
like shooting stills,

1993
01:42:35,185 --> 01:42:36,878
they are absolutely life-like.

1994
01:42:37,581 --> 01:42:39,109
I wish I could show you the phone.

1995
01:42:39,455 --> 01:42:41,794
Oh, I will, in New York.

1996
01:42:42,682 --> 01:42:46,511
We are going to have a festival
of films at MoMA,

1997
01:42:46,877 --> 01:42:48,413
from all over the world.

1998
01:42:48,949 --> 01:42:51,261
I want your film
to be premiered there.

1999
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:54,462
Oh, so kind of you, Sir.
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler. Thank you.

2000
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:57,073
And after a few days,
a famous Hollywood director,

2001
01:42:57,153 --> 01:42:59,697
John Hudson came to Kolkata
while on his way

2002
01:42:59,777 --> 01:43:00,817
to scout a location in Nepal.

2003
01:43:01,407 --> 01:43:04,625
Morgan Wheeler had
sent him to enquire,

2004
01:43:05,153 --> 01:43:07,418
how far along are we with the film?

2005
01:43:21,241 --> 01:43:23,686
Very good. Very nice.
- Thank you.

2006
01:43:24,332 --> 01:43:26,564
This lady had a fight
and she left the house.

2007
01:43:26,644 --> 01:43:28,353
Yeah, yeah. I understand.

2008
01:43:28,903 --> 01:43:30,014
That's all.

2009
01:43:32,829 --> 01:43:35,613
So, did it pass master, Mr. Hudson?

2010
01:43:35,693 --> 01:43:37,095
Oh, it certainly did.

2011
01:43:37,175 --> 01:43:39,133
In fact,
it's quite masterful, Mr. Ray.

2012
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,393
Monroe chose the right film
for his festival.

2013
01:43:41,473 --> 01:43:42,656
Very impressive indeed.

2014
01:43:42,736 --> 01:43:44,835
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Please come.

2015
01:43:45,614 --> 01:43:48,641
Due to Mr. Menon's tight hand
with the government money,

2016
01:43:49,469 --> 01:43:51,662
we were quite behind the schedule.

2017
01:43:52,413 --> 01:43:54,408
And meanwhile, the date
of MoMA's premiere was here.

2018
01:43:55,003 --> 01:43:57,204
We just had two more weeks.

2019
01:43:57,823 --> 01:44:00,302
And there was a lot of work pending

2020
01:44:00,382 --> 01:44:02,843
for editing and
finalizing the movie.

2021
01:44:03,373 --> 01:44:06,773
So we virtually didn't
sleep for 10 days and 10 nights

2022
01:44:06,853 --> 01:44:08,953
and somehow finished the movie.

2023
01:44:09,431 --> 01:44:11,363
10 days without sleep?

2024
01:44:11,443 --> 01:44:13,285
One hour here and there.

2025
01:44:13,913 --> 01:44:17,264
Brother Tumpa, I did it finally,
the last reel is left.

2026
01:44:17,344 --> 01:44:18,969
Just finish this too.

2027
01:44:27,623 --> 01:44:29,087
Here, here.

2028
01:44:38,945 --> 01:44:41,640
Brother Apu,
I can't do this anymore.

2029
01:44:41,952 --> 01:44:44,144
Should I take a nap
for 15-20 minutes?

2030
01:44:44,364 --> 01:44:46,800
And then...
- Yes, I understand brother Durga,

2031
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,673
but we have to send the
film tomorrow morning itself.

2032
01:44:49,174 --> 01:44:53,136
Do a thing, just spray
some water and get it done.

2033
01:44:53,646 --> 01:44:55,757
Go, go, quick.

2034
01:44:57,573 --> 01:44:58,781
Go!

2035
01:44:59,366 --> 01:45:01,305
If you sleep now,

2036
01:45:01,549 --> 01:45:03,351
you'll be in the same condition
as your colleague.

2037
01:45:41,735 --> 01:45:42,972
What happened?

2038
01:45:43,343 --> 01:45:44,694
Why did you switch on the light?

2039
01:45:44,892 --> 01:45:46,476
Babushona is in deep sleep.

2040
01:45:47,373 --> 01:45:49,244
It is 3:30 p.m. there.

2041
01:45:49,924 --> 01:45:51,396
Eastern Standard Time.

2042
01:45:52,592 --> 01:45:54,286
Screening must be starting now.

2043
01:45:55,626 --> 01:45:56,863
What's supposed
to happen will happen.

2044
01:45:56,943 --> 01:45:58,243
Don't stress, just sleep.

2045
01:45:58,323 --> 01:45:59,884
I'm not feeling sleepy, Vinku.

2046
01:46:00,216 --> 01:46:01,744
At least, give it a try.

2047
01:47:26,577 --> 01:47:27,837
It's quite late,

2048
01:47:28,662 --> 01:47:30,331
it should've been here by now.

2049
01:47:30,894 --> 01:47:33,276
Apu, are you writing to Morgan?

2050
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:36,163
Yes, it's almost three weeks today.

2051
01:47:36,243 --> 01:47:37,732
I don't know
what's the point in writing?

2052
01:47:38,003 --> 01:47:40,516
A movie made
on the rural life of Bangla,

2053
01:47:40,843 --> 01:47:42,930
why would the Englishmen like it?

2054
01:47:45,864 --> 01:47:47,041
I'll check.

2055
01:47:47,873 --> 01:47:50,453
Must have failed to engage
the cultural elite of New York.

2056
01:47:51,003 --> 01:47:52,997
The show must have
been a damn straight.

2057
01:47:53,382 --> 01:47:55,353
The film might have
been a super flop.

2058
01:47:55,638 --> 01:47:57,838
And Mr. Wheeler might be hesitant
to tell us that.

2059
01:47:58,535 --> 01:48:00,452
Apu, telegram.

2060
01:48:07,342 --> 01:48:08,652
What does it say?

2061
01:48:21,242 --> 01:48:22,366
What's it?

2062
01:48:22,883 --> 01:48:25,004
A triumph of
imaginative photography.

2063
01:48:25,825 --> 01:48:26,641
Letter for us.

2064
01:48:26,721 --> 01:48:28,951
Amazing news.
- Bravo, Mr. Mitter.

2065
01:48:29,235 --> 01:48:30,844
Congratulations.

2066
01:48:31,124 --> 01:48:34,243
Well done, well done!
- Hey Subir, bring the sweets.

2067
01:48:34,323 --> 01:48:36,613
That 'Lengcha', yes.
- Sure.

2068
01:48:36,693 --> 01:48:38,052
So New York is done.

2069
01:48:38,689 --> 01:48:41,987
But the movie was released
in Kolkata after a long while.

2070
01:48:42,565 --> 01:48:44,587
Before the official release here,

2071
01:48:44,905 --> 01:48:47,969
In an elite club for
the VIP's of Kolkata,

2072
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:50,143
a private screening was organized.

2073
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:52,013
I assume you got a great response.

2074
01:48:52,093 --> 01:48:53,290
It's almost time.

2075
01:48:53,525 --> 01:48:54,853
It will be good,
we are stressing needlessly.

2076
01:48:54,933 --> 01:48:56,712
There. Greetings.

2077
01:48:56,792 --> 01:48:59,343
Quite good.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

2078
01:48:59,423 --> 01:49:00,793
Coming.

2079
01:49:00,873 --> 01:49:02,914
There they are.

2080
01:49:04,733 --> 01:49:06,005
It was pretty good.

2081
01:49:06,085 --> 01:49:06,989
Was it good?

2082
01:49:07,069 --> 01:49:08,123
Good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

2083
01:49:08,203 --> 01:49:09,232
It was good.
- Thank you.

2084
01:49:09,312 --> 01:49:10,950
Thank you.
- It was good. Good.

2085
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:13,017
It was good. We liked your movie.

2086
01:49:13,393 --> 01:49:15,231
Rubbish, is this cinema

2087
01:49:15,311 --> 01:49:17,638
or a documentary?
- Exactly.

2088
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:19,601
If these cinemas
are shown outside India,

2089
01:49:19,681 --> 01:49:20,679
what would people think of us?

2090
01:49:20,759 --> 01:49:21,943
It was good.

2091
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:25,423
But too long and a little slow.

2092
01:49:25,503 --> 01:49:26,919
And quite tragic.

2093
01:49:26,999 --> 01:49:29,096
I cried a lot.

2094
01:49:29,176 --> 01:49:30,861
Yes, I am free, careful.

2095
01:49:30,941 --> 01:49:32,735
Yes, please move.

2096
01:49:35,932 --> 01:49:36,940
Oh, yes...
- There is no dearth

2097
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,273
of sorrow in our life, right?

2098
01:49:39,468 --> 01:49:44,539
And that's why people come to
the cinema, to forget their sorrows.

2099
01:49:44,968 --> 01:49:46,637
To escape the reality.

2100
01:49:46,877 --> 01:49:49,688
This is more like an art film.

2101
01:49:50,113 --> 01:49:53,055
While I was in the continent,
I saw a few of these.

2102
01:49:54,081 --> 01:49:57,383
A good attempt,
and I do wish you the very best.

2103
01:49:57,463 --> 01:49:58,886
Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Farewell.

2104
01:49:58,966 --> 01:50:00,723
What a damn!

2105
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:02,453
What a waste of Sunday afternoon.

2106
01:50:02,533 --> 01:50:05,147
Hi. We are absolutely floored.
What a film.

2107
01:50:05,227 --> 01:50:07,033
We have never seen
a movie like this before.

2108
01:50:07,113 --> 01:50:09,228
Not even in English.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

2109
01:50:09,308 --> 01:50:11,005
What a commendable job.
I'm very impressed.

2110
01:50:11,085 --> 01:50:12,333
Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Sir.

2111
01:50:12,413 --> 01:50:14,938
So glad you liked it.
- Thank you. Thank you.

2112
01:50:15,018 --> 01:50:17,123
See, they really liked it.

2113
01:50:17,203 --> 01:50:18,707
Farewell, thank you.

2114
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:22,297
It didn't, really capture
the heart of Bengalis.

2115
01:50:22,722 --> 01:50:24,140
A very lukewarm reaction.

2116
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:26,293
I think the foreigners
liked it more.

2117
01:50:26,373 --> 01:50:27,917
Activate the interest
toward films is so less

2118
01:50:27,997 --> 01:50:29,418
that it takes some
time to accept anything.

2119
01:50:29,779 --> 01:50:31,043
Or with Bengalis,
it can be pure jealousy as well.

2120
01:50:31,123 --> 01:50:35,135
The main thing is that people
who pay to see it should like it.

2121
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:37,831
It's okay, Apu, don't get so upset.

2122
01:50:39,836 --> 01:50:41,315
What is this?

2123
01:50:41,594 --> 01:50:43,392
What is this?
You tell me, what is this?

2124
01:50:45,363 --> 01:50:47,333
Circle picture.
- What's happening here?

2125
01:50:47,413 --> 01:50:48,673
See, he came here.

2126
01:50:48,753 --> 01:50:51,997
Listen, the scene where
the kids see the train,

2127
01:50:52,077 --> 01:50:53,610
shouldn't that be
made into a poster?

2128
01:50:53,943 --> 01:50:56,211
Yes, this is single sheet.
- Hey, you naughty.

2129
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:59,813
And the one you're talking
about is for 10 by 20 hoarding.

2130
01:51:00,157 --> 01:51:01,455
When is it releasing?

2131
01:51:01,884 --> 01:51:03,868
They say it would be August.
Let's see.

2132
01:51:04,555 --> 01:51:05,755
All the best.

2133
01:51:06,748 --> 01:51:07,973
Hey, Babu?

2134
01:51:08,053 --> 01:51:09,829
Just two more stoppages, right?
- Yes.

2135
01:51:09,909 --> 01:51:12,913
Yes. These two,

2136
01:51:16,483 --> 01:51:17,642
What happened, aunt?

2137
01:51:17,722 --> 01:51:19,493
I was just looking
at the poster of the film.

2138
01:51:19,573 --> 01:51:23,073
Isn't that the film
based on uncle's novel?

2139
01:51:23,153 --> 01:51:27,053
The poster has been made
by the film director himself.

2140
01:51:27,133 --> 01:51:28,983
Really, so beautiful, right?

2141
01:51:29,063 --> 01:51:31,633
I have never seen such
posters for Bengali film before.

2142
01:51:31,713 --> 01:51:34,146
He draws so wonderfully, right?
- Yeah.

2143
01:51:34,226 --> 01:51:37,493
After all,
he is Shrikumar Ray's son.

2144
01:51:37,573 --> 01:51:39,623
The film might have
been great as well.

2145
01:51:39,703 --> 01:51:43,322
But the story is not conventional.
Who knows whether it will work?

2146
01:51:45,882 --> 01:51:49,465
Not a problem, anyway, you
could have done the whole station.

2147
01:51:54,161 --> 01:51:57,133
Brother Apu, everything was fine.

2148
01:51:57,496 --> 01:52:00,880
It would have been better
had the holding been a bit wider.

2149
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,540
PATHER PADABALI

2150
01:52:04,752 --> 01:52:06,453
Oh wow, a long line.

2151
01:52:06,866 --> 01:52:08,371
Come.

2152
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:13,693
There's a good crowd every day.

2153
01:52:13,773 --> 01:52:15,883
Yes, I heard it yesterday in my
society, it's quite good, it seems.

2154
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:18,663
You didn't watched it yet?

2155
01:52:18,743 --> 01:52:23,074
An amazing film. I have seen it once
before. I brought my wife today.

2156
01:52:24,984 --> 01:52:26,373
One for evening, upper stall.

2157
01:52:26,453 --> 01:52:29,188
Brother, are tickets available?
- Just wait.

2158
01:52:29,268 --> 01:52:31,083
Wait, let me first
ask at the counter.

2159
01:52:31,986 --> 01:52:34,395
Two matinee show.
Brother, how is it selling?

2160
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:37,193
Sales... Today it's 60% complete.

2161
01:52:37,273 --> 01:52:38,542
It was running housefull yesterday.

2162
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:41,801
Okay, fine, let's go.

2163
01:52:42,187 --> 01:52:44,256
Take the change.
- Listen, dear.

2164
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:46,867
Tomorrow's a Sunday.

2165
01:52:47,338 --> 01:52:50,051
We'll go see a matinee show.

2166
01:52:50,426 --> 01:52:52,781
While returning from office,
I took two tickets.

2167
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:54,272
You'll go, right?

2168
01:52:54,591 --> 01:52:57,132
What movie are we going to watch?
- Asha Jawa?

2169
01:52:57,394 --> 01:53:00,653
Oh please,
you and your hopes and dreams.

2170
01:53:00,965 --> 01:53:03,795
You see, Pather Padabali.

2171
01:53:04,323 --> 01:53:06,025
Padabali?
- Yes.

2172
01:53:06,330 --> 01:53:08,233
Is this a spiritual book?

2173
01:53:08,313 --> 01:53:10,683
No, this is totally different.

2174
01:53:10,763 --> 01:53:12,601
It's about a village.

2175
01:53:13,331 --> 01:53:14,314
Oh, yes.

2176
01:53:14,584 --> 01:53:17,241
Sushila told me, this is that film.

2177
01:53:17,834 --> 01:53:20,873
Without hero-heroine, or songs.
Oh, please.

2178
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:23,211
What's the point in spending
money for such a film?

2179
01:53:23,291 --> 01:53:25,333
Oh please,
to hell with your dance and romance.

2180
01:53:25,413 --> 01:53:27,302
It's the same boring story.

2181
01:53:27,616 --> 01:53:31,111
Listen, my boss was
telling me that day,

2182
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:33,683
Mukherjee, see that film.

2183
01:53:33,988 --> 01:53:36,973
We have never had such
a cinema in our country before.

2184
01:53:37,053 --> 01:53:38,336
Oh, wow!

2185
01:53:38,726 --> 01:53:40,843
Your boss said so?
- Yes.

2186
01:53:41,166 --> 01:53:43,248
Isn't he like a proper gentleman?

2187
01:53:44,173 --> 01:53:45,378
Just imagine,

2188
01:53:45,873 --> 01:53:47,914
if we don't see this film,

2189
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:50,651
we won't be able
to face the society.

2190
01:53:51,604 --> 01:53:54,262
Fine, let's watch it then.

2191
01:53:54,342 --> 01:53:57,747
A pink gin for madam and for me....
- Vodka tonic?

2192
01:53:57,827 --> 01:54:00,073
Yes. And one plate of fish fingers.

2193
01:54:00,153 --> 01:54:01,289
Okay, sir.
- Thank you.

2194
01:54:02,391 --> 01:54:03,398
That should be alright or...

2195
01:54:03,478 --> 01:54:04,614
Yes.
- Hey?

2196
01:54:04,827 --> 01:54:05,930
Good afternoon, PK.
- Hey, hello.

2197
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:07,020
Hello.
- Hello.

2198
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,047
Are you not coming
for golf these days?

2199
01:54:08,127 --> 01:54:10,733
No, afraid not, a lot of travelling.

2200
01:54:10,813 --> 01:54:11,904
One tour after the other.
- Uma...

2201
01:54:11,984 --> 01:54:13,425
Okay, go, get it.
- Oh, really.

2202
01:54:13,505 --> 01:54:15,633
Why didn't you call me?
- You were getting...

2203
01:54:15,713 --> 01:54:17,880
Mr. Aparajito Ray?
- Yes?

2204
01:54:18,213 --> 01:54:19,443
Do you remember me?

2205
01:54:19,523 --> 01:54:21,776
We met during the first
screening of your film.

2206
01:54:22,002 --> 01:54:24,157
Do you remember?
- Of course, I do.

2207
01:54:24,623 --> 01:54:26,100
And I also remember your reaction.

2208
01:54:27,114 --> 01:54:29,505
I told my wife and everybody else,

2209
01:54:29,886 --> 01:54:32,833
this film is going to go places.
- It has.

2210
01:54:33,211 --> 01:54:35,553
All the way to New York?
- Oh, really?

2211
01:54:35,912 --> 01:54:37,484
My boss, Mr. Newman.

2212
01:54:39,565 --> 01:54:41,570
Not for long.
- Why so?

2213
01:54:42,543 --> 01:54:44,809
He wants to be an
independent film director.

2214
01:54:45,181 --> 01:54:47,439
And like your country,

2215
01:54:47,763 --> 01:54:49,636
he wants to be independent too.

2216
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:51,163
Excellent!

2217
01:54:51,243 --> 01:54:53,303
Well, I'll take your leave.

2218
01:54:53,383 --> 01:54:54,573
Thank you.

2219
01:54:55,194 --> 01:54:57,303
He seemed overwhelmed by you film.

2220
01:54:57,703 --> 01:55:01,044
On the contrary,
he seemed quite underwhelmed

2221
01:55:01,501 --> 01:55:02,546
after the film.

2222
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:07,346
I told you,
this film is going to be a hit.

2223
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:09,309
Did you?

2224
01:55:09,573 --> 01:55:12,173
You said it will be a flop.

2225
01:55:13,151 --> 01:55:14,791
Initially,
it wasn't getting any attraction.

2226
01:55:15,237 --> 01:55:18,183
It took a week for people
to notice it's in halls.

2227
01:55:18,263 --> 01:55:21,323
Listen dear,
Bengalis have this snobbishness.

2228
01:55:21,403 --> 01:55:23,263
It received an award or
something in the English nation,

2229
01:55:23,343 --> 01:55:25,194
and that drove the
Bengalis to the theater.

2230
01:55:25,274 --> 01:55:27,105
No matter what you say,
it's a fantastic film.

2231
01:55:27,392 --> 01:55:28,986
Capturing the rural Bangla
in celluloid like this.

2232
01:55:29,066 --> 01:55:29,999
Oh, please!

2233
01:55:30,282 --> 01:55:32,473
All the Englishmen want to
see is the poverty of our nation.

2234
01:55:32,553 --> 01:55:33,956
They will gulp it up.

2235
01:55:34,036 --> 01:55:35,843
Do you know why this film
is getting so much attraction?

2236
01:55:35,923 --> 01:55:38,229
Seeing the poverty and
underdevelopment of our nation

2237
01:55:38,309 --> 01:55:39,743
makes them feel superior.

2238
01:55:39,823 --> 01:55:42,468
Poverty is porn now.
- Stop your rubbish.

2239
01:55:43,517 --> 01:55:45,164
You have no idea
of what a cinema is.

2240
01:55:45,244 --> 01:55:48,016
The praying mantis dancing in pond,
the toads,

2241
01:55:48,423 --> 01:55:49,862
the pleasure of dancing in rain,

2242
01:55:49,942 --> 01:55:52,413
the excitement of
seeing your first train,

2243
01:55:52,493 --> 01:55:54,784
have you ever seen
this pictorization before?

2244
01:55:55,226 --> 01:55:57,193
Have you heard of
eternal neo-realism?

2245
01:55:59,116 --> 01:56:01,986
It wipes away the difference
between film and reality.

2246
01:56:02,066 --> 01:56:02,903
Exactly!

2247
01:56:02,983 --> 01:56:06,326
Actually, we did have cinema, but
the cinema didn't have its language.

2248
01:56:06,573 --> 01:56:10,773
Pather Padabali made a Bengali,
an Indian look into movie.

2249
01:56:10,853 --> 01:56:13,943
That director was a regular here.
- Exactly.

2250
01:56:14,023 --> 01:56:16,626
Quite tall, he had a reserved table.

2251
01:56:17,441 --> 01:56:19,243
Who knew he would do this before?

2252
01:56:19,323 --> 01:56:20,362
Then we would have
cultivated something.

2253
01:56:20,442 --> 01:56:21,243
That's occupied.

2254
01:56:21,323 --> 01:56:22,852
There's the chance
of your cultivation.

2255
01:56:22,932 --> 01:56:24,419
Sir, you are in queue.

2256
01:56:25,008 --> 01:56:27,373
Brother Bishu,
how come you are calling me sir?

2257
01:56:27,453 --> 01:56:29,183
Really... Sunil...
- Can we take that table?

2258
01:56:29,263 --> 01:56:31,715
Yes, sir. That table...
- If I could get an autograph?

2259
01:56:32,555 --> 01:56:34,166
Go ahead. You'll have
to give a lot of photographs.

2260
01:56:34,246 --> 01:56:36,477
Nothing to be ashamed of.
- Yeah, right.

2261
01:56:36,912 --> 01:56:38,251
Welcome to celebrity hood.

2262
01:56:53,778 --> 01:56:55,213
Come.

2263
01:57:08,245 --> 01:57:09,981
Shiela was right.

2264
01:58:03,818 --> 01:58:05,581
You funded the right film.

2265
01:58:06,129 --> 01:58:08,662
I told him to change the end.
It's a sad ending.

2266
01:58:08,901 --> 01:58:10,213
But he didn't agree with me.

2267
01:58:10,769 --> 01:58:12,833
That would have been
an absolute disaster.

2268
01:58:13,096 --> 01:58:15,259
No, this is just perfect!

2269
01:58:15,339 --> 01:58:17,414
This family from a small village,

2270
01:58:17,803 --> 01:58:19,787
moving out into the wide world,

2271
01:58:20,063 --> 01:58:21,955
this is just a perfect ending.

2272
01:58:24,268 --> 01:58:25,884
Well done, young man.

2273
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:29,231
I have never seen such
a wonderful movie in my life.

2274
01:58:29,805 --> 01:58:32,012
I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

2275
01:58:32,672 --> 01:58:34,099
Thank you, Mr. Ray.

2276
01:58:35,512 --> 01:58:37,871
This has been a wonderful
experience for me.

2277
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:40,815
Ray?

2278
01:58:41,499 --> 01:58:44,117
I'll definitely have
a word with the I&amp;B ministry.

2279
01:58:44,444 --> 01:58:47,013
As per the Bombay Film college,
they have no idea

2280
01:58:47,093 --> 01:58:49,637
of what an artistic cinema is?

2281
01:58:50,167 --> 01:58:53,114
I'll see to it that it definitely
goes to Cannes, Roy.

2282
01:58:53,394 --> 01:58:56,523
The very first film,
going to a festival like Cannes.

2283
01:58:56,973 --> 01:59:00,752
And getting the prestigious
award of best human document.

2284
01:59:01,183 --> 01:59:03,293
The taste of success,

2285
01:59:03,373 --> 01:59:05,468
will you please share
it with our listeners?

2286
01:59:05,981 --> 01:59:08,338
See, I couldn't go to Cannes then

2287
01:59:08,976 --> 01:59:11,849
I heard it later,
and this was written about as well.

2288
01:59:11,929 --> 01:59:13,345
You must have read it.

2289
01:59:13,425 --> 01:59:16,401
Of course I did,
but if you could say.

2290
01:59:16,643 --> 01:59:19,803
My movie was shown towards
the end of the festival.

2291
01:59:19,883 --> 01:59:21,147
Also, the auditorium

2292
01:59:21,227 --> 01:59:23,363
where the screening happened
was relatively smaller.

2293
01:59:23,848 --> 01:59:26,571
Where unimportant films
generally get screened.

2294
01:59:26,886 --> 01:59:28,653
There were very few people
watching it as well.

2295
01:59:29,018 --> 01:59:32,114
And I think in the entire festival,

2296
01:59:32,614 --> 01:59:36,488
after watching all the famous films
and partying till late in the night,

2297
01:59:36,568 --> 01:59:38,397
people were tired.

2298
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:42,510
And initially even the audience
was little restless.

2299
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:46,313
Rumour has it that a
famous critic just walked out.

2300
01:59:46,393 --> 01:59:48,058
Sister, have you
ever watched a train?

2301
01:59:48,138 --> 01:59:49,099
Yes.

2302
01:59:49,363 --> 01:59:52,149
The uncivilised natives
were eating with their hands.

2303
01:59:52,229 --> 01:59:53,299
He could not take it.

2304
01:59:54,637 --> 01:59:56,153
Even I have heard about it.

2305
01:59:56,745 --> 01:59:59,879
A diary of cinema's Francois
Truffaut commented it as:

2306
02:00:00,357 --> 02:00:02,753
"Pad, pad,
pad through the paddy fields."

2307
02:00:03,553 --> 02:00:06,520
Although later,
he denied everything about it.

2308
02:00:07,909 --> 02:00:10,223
Then ultimately it happened
what was meant to be.

2309
02:00:10,303 --> 02:00:13,923
I can understand
you are being a bit hesitated.

2310
02:00:14,463 --> 02:00:16,239
To talk about that day.

2311
02:00:17,072 --> 02:00:18,139
In that case,

2312
02:00:19,284 --> 02:00:21,975
let me recreate that moment again.

2313
02:00:23,827 --> 02:00:27,076
In the magazine,
Film Buff, McSeaton...

2314
02:00:27,388 --> 02:00:29,148
has described the occassion.

2315
02:00:29,533 --> 02:00:31,217
"Unheralded at Cannes,"

2316
02:00:32,255 --> 02:00:35,691
"Pather Padavali was
announced for screening."

2317
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,860
"On a sultry afternoon..."

2318
02:00:38,104 --> 02:00:39,840
"towards the end of the festival."

2319
02:00:41,087 --> 02:00:43,524
"A somewhat distraught audience..."

2320
02:00:44,147 --> 02:00:46,889
"bored by
too many cocktail parties..."

2321
02:00:47,321 --> 02:00:51,484
"and an endless parade
of films gathered to see it."

2322
02:00:51,767 --> 02:00:55,278
"The critics who were there,
expected nothing more..."

2323
02:00:55,582 --> 02:00:58,163
"than the usual Indian films."

2324
02:00:58,243 --> 02:01:00,493
"With dances, songs,"

2325
02:01:00,573 --> 02:01:03,733
"sacred cows and melodrama."

2326
02:01:03,813 --> 02:01:08,881
"and the first moments seemed
to confirm their worst suspicions."

2327
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:10,976
"For those who remained,"

2328
02:01:11,813 --> 02:01:14,519
"the unexpected began to happen."

2329
02:01:15,258 --> 02:01:18,800
"Suddenly, the audience realised..."

2330
02:01:19,132 --> 02:01:23,467
"that the magic horse of poetry
was invading the screen."

2331
02:01:23,782 --> 02:01:27,533
"The breadth of the story
became large."

2332
02:01:27,613 --> 02:01:29,196
"And the purity of the images"

2333
02:01:29,276 --> 02:01:32,070
"corresponded to the purity
of the subject."

2334
02:01:32,349 --> 02:01:36,097
"The people who were fidgeting,
became still."

2335
02:01:36,658 --> 02:01:38,623
"The murmurs died out."

2336
02:01:38,863 --> 02:01:42,227
"And there was utter silence
in the auditorium."

2337
02:01:42,693 --> 02:01:44,810
"Everyone was witnessing..."

2338
02:01:45,415 --> 02:01:47,568
"the magic of cinema."

2339
02:01:48,245 --> 02:01:50,136
"They were wonderstruck."

2340
02:01:53,173 --> 02:01:58,112
"And then, once the film ended,
they all stood up."

2341
02:01:58,636 --> 02:02:01,721
"To get a long, standing ovation."

2342
02:02:01,801 --> 02:02:04,699
Now I am calling on stage,
Mr. Aparajito Ray.

2343
02:02:05,598 --> 02:02:06,792
Come.

2344
02:02:13,778 --> 02:02:14,774
Thank you.

2345
02:02:15,103 --> 02:02:16,623
Congratulations.

2346
02:02:18,823 --> 02:02:21,933
And I am feeling very proud
to let you all know.

2347
02:02:22,013 --> 02:02:24,243
That one of our members' film...

2348
02:02:24,323 --> 02:02:26,871
has been awarded as
the 'best human document'

2349
02:02:26,951 --> 02:02:29,603
in the France's famous
Cannes Film Festival.

2350
02:02:29,683 --> 02:02:30,883
This is the first time

2351
02:02:30,963 --> 02:02:33,794
any Indian Film Director
has received this prestigious award.

2352
02:02:34,038 --> 02:02:35,573
Holding Pather Padavali's hands,

2353
02:02:35,653 --> 02:02:38,687
Bangla and Indian Cinema
has reached into the World stage.

2354
02:02:39,083 --> 02:02:43,226
Now I would request Aparajito
to share his experiences with us.

2355
02:02:52,710 --> 02:02:55,128
Greetings. Receiving this award,

2356
02:02:55,748 --> 02:02:58,238
I am elated and proud.

2357
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:02,226
But receiving the acceptance
and acknowledgement from...

2358
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:04,746
the people of my city and country,
gives a different kind of happiness.

2359
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:06,056
Won't they give us?

2360
02:03:06,136 --> 02:03:10,675
The way I am being felicitated
in different parts of the city,

2361
02:03:11,295 --> 02:03:12,522
I am overwhelmed.

2362
02:03:19,421 --> 02:03:21,711
ANANDABAZAR MAGAZINE
HUGE PUBLIC FELICIATION IN SENATE HAL

2363
02:03:29,046 --> 02:03:30,796
Your Tea.

2364
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:33,073
Yes.
- What are you thinking?

2365
02:03:34,741 --> 02:03:37,128
I am thinking, the people
who were involved with this movie,

2366
02:03:37,677 --> 02:03:41,306
all of them are getting felicitated.

2367
02:03:41,877 --> 02:03:44,074
But one person missed all of this.

2368
02:03:44,712 --> 02:03:46,992
Nonibala Devi.
- Exactly.

2369
02:03:48,689 --> 02:03:50,912
One of the best performances
in the World cinema.

2370
02:03:51,992 --> 02:03:53,313
I agree.

2371
02:03:53,697 --> 02:03:55,238
But you know what do I think?

2372
02:03:55,765 --> 02:03:57,996
The first day you
showed that film to her,

2373
02:03:58,076 --> 02:04:00,052
I saw a smile of
satisfaction on her face.

2374
02:04:00,747 --> 02:04:04,167
Maybe she also understood that
the film was going to become huge.

2375
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:06,429
I also miss her.

2376
02:04:06,819 --> 02:04:09,108
Especially, her toothless smile.

2377
02:04:09,414 --> 02:04:10,573
Brilliant!

2378
02:04:11,512 --> 02:04:13,203
I am remembering one more incident.

2379
02:04:13,283 --> 02:04:15,583
"Lord, the day has passed,"

2380
02:04:15,663 --> 02:04:19,791
"evening has beckoned,
pass me through everything."

2381
02:04:20,526 --> 02:04:22,155
"Lord, the day has passed,"

2382
02:04:22,235 --> 02:04:24,373
"evening has beckoned,
pass me through everything."

2383
02:04:24,453 --> 02:04:26,443
Brother Apu,
Nonibala Devi's part is done.

2384
02:04:26,523 --> 02:04:28,622
Yes, it's her pack up.
Send her home.

2385
02:04:29,432 --> 02:04:32,358
What's this?
She is still acting being dead here?

2386
02:04:32,996 --> 02:04:34,545
Nonibala Devi?

2387
02:04:38,344 --> 02:04:39,704
Nonibala Devi?

2388
02:04:41,103 --> 02:04:42,853
Nonibala Devi?
- Yes.

2389
02:04:42,933 --> 02:04:44,563
Please get up. The shot is done.

2390
02:04:44,643 --> 02:04:45,653
What is done?

2391
02:04:45,733 --> 02:04:48,693
Your part is done. Why are
you lying down? Please get up.

2392
02:04:48,773 --> 02:04:50,130
Done?
- Yes.

2393
02:04:50,466 --> 02:04:53,263
But nobody has said 'cut'.

2394
02:04:53,343 --> 02:04:56,037
I have been lying down
holding my breath all this while.

2395
02:04:56,117 --> 02:04:58,225
Okay, okay. Cut, cut.

2396
02:04:58,530 --> 02:05:02,403
Wow! Ultimately even
Naivedya admired your film?

2397
02:05:04,463 --> 02:05:07,012
I feel as if I am
in a deep trance, Apu.

2398
02:05:07,632 --> 02:05:08,996
How did it all happen?

2399
02:05:09,523 --> 02:05:13,056
I think that the entire universe
conspire to make things happen.

2400
02:05:15,730 --> 02:05:17,297
But, do you know what I think?

2401
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,954
Behind all of this happening,

2402
02:05:20,578 --> 02:05:22,978
we cannot take away the due
credit from your white owl as well.

2403
02:05:26,422 --> 02:05:29,788
Whether it is due to
the own merit of the film...

2404
02:05:30,763 --> 02:05:33,862
or due to the hoots
of the white owl.

2405
02:05:34,273 --> 02:05:36,620
It's admiration would
only be wide-spread.

2406
02:05:36,882 --> 02:05:39,323
I don't have a speck
of doubt about that.

2407
02:05:39,403 --> 02:05:43,103
I certainly know that
this film would keep...

2408
02:05:43,458 --> 02:05:45,490
inspiring many film enthusiasts

2409
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:48,673
and film directors
for the years to come.

2410
02:05:49,466 --> 02:05:52,243
AFTER 10 YEARS

2411
02:06:22,339 --> 02:06:23,879
Hello?
- 'Hello.'

2412
02:06:24,326 --> 02:06:26,571
'Hello, hello. Mr. Aparajito Ray?'

2413
02:06:27,223 --> 02:06:28,442
Yes, that's correct.

2414
02:06:29,190 --> 02:06:32,083
'There is a call for you
from New York, USA.'

2415
02:06:32,724 --> 02:06:34,526
New York?
- 'Yes.'

2416
02:06:34,814 --> 02:06:36,696
Okay, put me through.
- 'Hold on.'

2417
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:40,926
'Sir, is that Mr. Aparajito Ray?'

2418
02:06:41,006 --> 02:06:42,298
Yes, that's correct.

2419
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:44,951
'Sir, I am a student
at the New York University.'

2420
02:06:45,031 --> 02:06:46,548
'I first watched your film.'

2421
02:06:46,628 --> 02:06:49,099
'Pather Padavali a couple
of years back on television'

2422
02:06:49,179 --> 02:06:50,963
'but that was the dubbed version.'

2423
02:06:51,187 --> 02:06:54,166
'But last night, I watched
the whole trilogy, back to back.'

2424
02:06:54,246 --> 02:06:55,551
'The way how cinema-men
would have it.'

2425
02:06:55,848 --> 02:06:57,464
'With proper subtitles and all.'

2426
02:06:58,887 --> 02:07:01,388
'Can you hear me, Sir?'
- Yes, clearly.

2427
02:07:01,704 --> 02:07:04,487
'Mr. Ray, I got your phone number
from an Indian classmate.'

2428
02:07:05,012 --> 02:07:07,966
'Sir,
your films simply blew my mind.'

2429
02:07:08,603 --> 02:07:09,753
Thank you very much.

2430
02:07:09,833 --> 02:07:11,460
Thank you for taking
the trouble of calling me

2431
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:12,822
all the way from New York.

2432
02:07:13,405 --> 02:07:14,458
And letting me know.

2433
02:07:14,911 --> 02:07:18,243
It's very encouraging indeed.
But I didn't get your name.

2434
02:07:18,643 --> 02:07:20,174
'My name is Martin, Sir.'

2435
02:07:20,542 --> 02:07:21,817
'Martin Scottish.'

2436
02:07:22,695 --> 02:07:24,593
Thank you, Martin.
Thank you for your kind words.

2437
02:07:24,673 --> 02:07:26,903
'My pleasure, Sir.
All the best. Goodbye.'

2438
02:07:27,307 --> 02:07:28,458
Bye-bye.
