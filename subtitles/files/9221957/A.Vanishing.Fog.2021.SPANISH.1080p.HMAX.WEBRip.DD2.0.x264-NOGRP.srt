1
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,760
I'd like to speak of this memory...

2
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,640
But it's so faded now...
as though nothing is left,

3
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,400
because it was so long ago,
in my adolescent years.

4
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,879
Constantine Cavafy

5
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,160
"If you think you were slain by my hand
Then send for me, Mother.

6
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,759
Bury me in the fires of hell.

7
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,399
Are these men my enemies?

8
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,560
There is no water without earth,
no earth without water.

9
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,079
I beg forgiveness, and I repent.

10
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
Alerting all units,

11
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,000
<i>it's been reported that another</i>
<i>watchman has gone missing.</i>

12
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,200
<i>Don Colombo, it's been a while</i>
<i>since we've heard from you.</i>

13
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,960
Do you need supplies?

14
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,759
Colombo Quisquiza, Unit 8,
Paramo Alto...

15
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,559
Your son F, has failed to check in.

16
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,960
<i>There are reports of hostile</i>
<i>activity in the area."</i>

17
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,720
To sin is to lack faith in God
and a true love for one's neighbor.

18
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,079
Succumbing to ambition,
greed, and the devil...

19
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:32,480
Sin hurts the true nature of man
and undermines human solidarity.

20
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,480
War has no purpose; instead,
we must...

21
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,559
...build peace and find
harmony in our family.

22
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,279
A family is a group of individuals
rife with defects

23
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,839
that God brings together
in spite of their differences

24
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,400
so that they may
develop tolerance, respect,

25
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,039
gratitude, patience,
and forgiveness

26
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,160
doing for others what we would
like them to do unto us

27
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,079
without demanding the perfection
that we do not yet have.

28
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,079
We are born where we deserve,
in order to grow and evolve.

29
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,680
Sin is living in hatred
and resentment.

30
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,839
Sin is the loss of Paradise.

31
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,000
How long can we live
with the misery of man,

32
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,720
with our innate wretchedness
and our desire to deplete

33
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,079
devour and dominate
everything around?

34
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,240
The time has come to surrender
God will not lead us astray.

35
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:39,200
By orders of the Superior Command,
all watchmen and guards must retreat.

36
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,599
You understand we ought to go.
No crops, no cattle, no life.

37
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,960
Nobody wants to stay like this.

38
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,599
Tell your father that he should
sell the land too.

39
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,200
They're paying quickly in US Dollars.
There is no future here.

40
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,680
Rosa...

41
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,960
I will take you to her.

42
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,280
In the name of the Father and the Son
Forever and ever

43
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,679
Our ancestors have been banished.
We are not like them anymore

44
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,440
We no longer use their words
We no longer have a language

45
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,000
We no longer can be fed I am
your servant, the son of your mercy.

46
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,199
<i>Massive dams displace millions of</i>
<i>people and destroy whole eco-systems.</i>

47
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,599
<i>Global warming is altering</i>
<i>the water cycle,</i>

48
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:11,800
<i>causing more severe and unpredictable</i>
<i>flooding and droughts...</i>

49
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,360
<i>Unregulated corporate privatization</i>
<i>threatens access to water for the poor.</i>

50
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,679
<i>Some governments fail to deliver water</i>
<i>where it is needed most.</i>

51
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,679
<i>These stresses have created</i>
<i>political and military conflicts</i>

52
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,679
that will only get worse.

53
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,719
Ultimately, humanity is poisoning,

54
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,840
<i>squandering and overburdening</i>
<i>water resources.</i>

55
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,760
<i>The result is that billions of people</i>
<i>lack access to clean water.</i>

56
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,159
<i>Millions of children die every year</i>
<i>from preventable water born diseases.</i>

57
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,599
<i>Lack of clean water and basic sanitation</i>
<i>traps people in problem.</i>

58
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,920
People are fighting and dying for it.

59
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,159
Attention: All community members
are advised to not engage in conflict.

60
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,039
<i>And now the moment</i>
<i>you have been waiting for.</i>

61
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:01,880
<i>It's time to study, it's time to learn,</i>
<i>it's time to have fun.</i>

62
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,039
<i>It's English time.</i>
<i>Right here, right now.</i>

63
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,480
<i>Now, repeat after me:</i>
<i>The morning is sunny.</i>

64
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:15,159
The morning is sunny.

65
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,440
Very well. Now, repeat after me:

66
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:26,199
<i>- The afternoon is rainy.</i>
<i>- The afternoon is rainy.</i>

67
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,760
<i>Very well!</i>
<i>Now repeat after me:</i>

68
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:36,719
<i>- The night is cold.</i>
<i>- The night is cold.</i>

69
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,320
<i>- I am very happy.</i>
<i>- I am very happy.</i>

70
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,000
Sumapaz here, over.
Clear and present danger, over.

71
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,519
Sumapaz here, over.
Clear and present danger, over.

72
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:14,519
Can anybody hear me?

73
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:18,320
Can anybody hear me?

74
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,000
Get me out!

75
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,960
Can anybody hear me?

76
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:50,519
Nothing belongs to us, Mother
I rather remain quiet than lie.

77
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,519
A dagger plunged
into my chest is tearing me apart

78
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:57,880
splitting me
between my shoulders.

79
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
I yearn to taste the salt of the sea

80
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,079
My veins are entwined
with the soil of this land.

81
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,039
The end draws ever
near to snatch my soul,

82
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,039
crumbling my bones
and reducing me to dust.

83
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,679
Will I be forgiven?
My father is already with you.

84
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,719
Hello, hello...

85
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,719
<i>Colombo or son, whoever can hear us.</i>
<i>We are being slaughtered!</i>

86
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:35,119
to my father, in memoriam
