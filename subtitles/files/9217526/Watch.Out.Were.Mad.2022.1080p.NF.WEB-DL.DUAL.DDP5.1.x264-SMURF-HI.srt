00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,625
I have no idea how I lost.

357
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,708
What's that?

358
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,833
- That the cars were all the same.
- No, after that.

359
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,416
I just said, uh, mine was souped.

360
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
After.

361
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,000
After, um... [smacking lips]

362
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,166
Uh, what was it, Dad?

363
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,500
[sighs]

364
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,958
Now, listen. It might have looked
like you lost the race.

365
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,541
But it's just an impression.

366
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,708
No. Look, Dad, I really lost out there.
You were there too.

367
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,916
[sighs] In a race,
it's not about fairness.

368
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
Only winning matters.

369
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,916
A Torsillo never accepts defeat.

370
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,458
But that's why we always win.

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,666
Come. Follow me. Come.

372
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,583
Who cares if they have the car?
Just go there and take it.

373
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,000
[Raniero] Right.
But they're not just gonna give it to me.

374
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,583
You can't just go there and be like,

375
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,083
"Excuse me, please give me the car." Huh?

376
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,500
Mention the name Torsillo,
and they'll shit their pants. [chuckles]

377
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,541
After all, it's more fun to get something
when you don't deserve it! [chuckles]

378
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,666
"Torsillo."

379
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,250
See, Raniero, your father here
was in a similar position.

380
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,750
He wants that land. They won't let it go.

381
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,125
And believe me, I know.

382
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,833
It is theirs, after all.

383
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,541
And so what should dad say?

384
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,458
My feet, I can't feel them.

385
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,375
No, really, Alfredo. Of course,
you've been there for freaking two hours.

386
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,750
You should accept already,
before your brain freezes too, eh?

387
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,083
It's not for sale.

388
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,666
That's my home.

389
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,791
[shivering, sneezing]

390
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,125
I said I want a clean job,
and so I want a clean job.

391
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,750
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,791
I'll have to throw away the meat
if he contaminates it with his bacteria.

393
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,041
- You know?
- Yes, sir.

394
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,833
- [sneezes]
- Hey.

395
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,166
Sorry. [sniffles]

396
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,250
- The cold air.
- Why do I get this always?

397
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,666
Tell me. Close it.

398
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,375
No. No, no, no, no. No!

399
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,166
[snoring]

400
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:13,958
[Geremia whimpering]

401
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,666
[shushing]

402
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,125
[snorts]

403
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,375
[tuts]

404
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,125
[groaning] Ow!

405
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,916
Why would you do that?
I just wanna drive, you know?

406
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,375
- [Stroke] Why?
- [groans]

407
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,750
Because until we settle the matter, yeah,
the buggy is staying right here.

408
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
- Oh yeah?
- Oh yeah.

409
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,958
Hey, you know if I want,
I can take it without the keys, right?

410
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,458
- I see.
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,791
[sighs] All right, then.

412
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,875
[pats]

413
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,333
[splutters]

414
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,791
Hold up. Hold up.

415
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,291
You find the joker, the buggy's yours.

416
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,125
I'm not falling for that.

417
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,833
- Piss off there, buddy.
- [exhales] I could be offended by that.

418
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,750
Or what if we settled it
like we did in the past?

419
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,583
- [scoffs] Like in the past?
- [Smiley] Mm-hmm.

420
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,125
I'm on a diet.

421
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,208
Uh... One second.

422
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,666
Okay, I... I get it.

423
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,875
- But what kind of diet?
- Dissociated.

424
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,875
- Ah, now I see.
- Mmm.

425
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,083
[exhales]

426
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,708
[groans]

427
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,833
When did you last clean here?

428
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,958
This place could use the touch of a woman.

429
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,083
[bowl clanks]

430
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,375
You got a girl now?

431
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,541
- [Stroke] Geremia, it's ready!
- No, I mean, besides Geremia.

432
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,125
- Okay. I'm in.
- Hmm.

433
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,559
- Like in the past, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,583
As long as you keep quiet and be still.

435
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,375
Okay. But I'll drive us.

436
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,875
[whimsical music playing]

437
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,916
[laughing]

438
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,500
[man] Ugh, they came back again.

439
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,375
- Those damn Cobras.
- [glass clinking]

440
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,791
[door opens]

441
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:58,875
Ah.

442
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,833
You really changed up the place.

443
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,333
[footsteps crunching glass]

444
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,125
What'll it be?

445
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,041
[Smiley sighing] Ah, let's see now...

446
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,875
20 pints and 20 sausages, yeah?

447
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,750
- [Stroke clears throat]
- Uh, 40 sausages.

448
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,625
- [Stroke] Mmm.
- And a vanilla ice cream. Thank you.

449
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,708
Cleanses the palate.

450
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,208
[comical music playing]

451
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,750
[munching]

452
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,666
[comical music continues]

453
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,041
[man] Miriam.

454
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,791
<i>Karasho!</i>

455
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,291
[bangs table]

456
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,833
Of course, they trashed everything.

457
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:10,000
They trashed the circus,
and you're here munching on hot dogs?

458
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,916
Would you look at me? Yo!

459
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,916
You're worse than the Cobras.

460
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,250
I don't wanna see you.

461
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,666
What are you looking at?

462
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,958
You must be a robber.

463
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,416
- How dare you!
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,125
'Cause my heart has been stolen.

465
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,416
I don't believe it. Okay?

466
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,666
- Talking romance?
- Mm-hmm.

467
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,666
- I'd sooner die.
- Okay.

468
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,416
[spits]

469
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,250
- That's the mother of my children.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,833
I need a break.
The heart wants what the heart wants.

471
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,208
Plus, you've got something on your... Hey!

472
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,458
[chuckles]

473
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,916
Well, if you quit, then I win. Okay?

474
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,208
I'll be a minute. Gotta get my heart back.

475
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,208
[pants]

476
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,708
I don't believe it.

477
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,166
[sighs]

478
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,333
[exhales]

00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,375
[Geremia barking]

480
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,375
I had nothing to do with this.

481
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,041
[amusing music playing]

482
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,166
[groaning]

483
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,125
Hey, can't you hit another spot?

484
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,666
- Where is it?
- No clue.

485
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,666
I can imagine they stole her.

486
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,208
[keys jingle]

487
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:41,791

[tiger growling softly]

491
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:00,791
[Miriam] Good girl.

492
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,375
- In position.
- [Smiley sighs]

493
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Soraya.

494
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,166
Here.

495
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,541
Good. Good.

496
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,625
Now roll.

00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,291
[clicking tongue]

498
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,208
She's amazing.

499
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,916
- [Miriam] And now up.
- [whip cracking]

500
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
- [tiger growling softly]
- [Miriam] Good girl!

501
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,458
- I don't know. I smell a rat.
- Hmm?

502
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,267
- [Miriam] The other side.
- [Smiley sniffing]

503
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:26,250
- [Miriam] good.
- I think it's the camel.

504
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,208
Don't worry.

505
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,625
I'm pretty sure we can barter
with these folks.

506
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,666
I have a plan. Here.
I'll sort it out for you.

507
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,583
- [Miriam] Good girl.
- [whip cracking]

508
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,083
Uh, Stroke.

509
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,166
Soraya doesn't bite her meat
unless I cut it beforehand, huh?

510
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,770
That must be a nice cat. That's great.

511
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:41,851
- Can I feed you?
- No, no.

512
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,000
Cut it already.

513
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,916
Don't. But I still need it.
No, no, no, no.

514
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,559
- Cats love the flesh.
- That buggy you stole back there is mine.

515
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,583
- No. Ours.
- Repeat that.

516
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,166
- Yeah.
- We're not stealing from you.

517
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,125
No, no, no. No one's trying to say
you're thieves. No. No.

518
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,166
- [Miriam] Then get out of here.
- All right.

519
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,125
[Miriam] We have enough problems already.

520
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,000
- [groans]
- Who can we talk to about it?

521
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,833
Armandino might know about it.

522
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,125
But I must warn you that... [sucks teeth]

523
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,791
...you'll need a translator.

524
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,291
Okay.

525
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,125
[Armandino grunts]

526
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,125
- This is Armandino, my cousin. Hmm?
- [Stroke] Mmm.

527
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,333
Not so little, huh?

528
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,375
For 50 bucks, I'll translate for you.

529
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,125
- [Stroke] Fifty?
- Sure, fifty.

530
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,208
Okay.

531
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:25,875
[Stroke] Mmm.

532
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,318
[in fake foreign language]
Armandi, come talk to these guys.

533
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,458
[in English] So, hey, Mr. Armandino. Um...

534
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,208
In no way do we have something
against your business as a thief.

535
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,333
[Miriam] Thanks.

536
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,666
But since you seem to be
a distinguished and reasonable person,

537
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,916
you'll understand why we want it back.

538
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,375
[chuckles] Mmm.

539
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,184
[in fake foreign language]
He's saying I'm really nice.

540
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,375
He's asking to bang me.

541
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:51,958
[in fake foreign language] Tell him
if he wants to die, I'll sort that out.

542
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,934
- Tell him! Tell him!
- [in Romani] I'll tell him.

543
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,358
[in English] Look, my cousin is mortified
by what's happened.

544
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,750
He very much
more than more apologizes for it.

545
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,416
I know he's stolen your buggy,
but he's not giving it back.

546
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,666
- No give it back.
- No back.

547
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,375
- Won't give it to us.
- No?

548
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,375
- No.
- But please smile!

549
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,291
You don't want him thinking
you're disrespectful. Yeah?

550
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,625
- [chuckles] That's great.
- Mm-hmm. Come here.

551
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,642
[Armandino in fake foreign language]
Why's he smiling?

552
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,333
He says I'm cheap but worth it.

553
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,296
[in English] I think
we're getting played today.

554
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,166
[Smiley] Mm-hmm.

555
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,934
[in fake foreign language]
You're disrespecting me.

556
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,875
You're disrespecting my cousin!

557
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,791
Nobody talks about my cousin like that!

558
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:29,083
Nobody talks about my family like that!

559
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,458
[in English] He's saying,
"It belongs to me."

560
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,875
- "Me and only me."
- Me. Only me.

561
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,625
- Won't give it back!
- Mine!

562
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,040
- I just need to talk for a second.
- [Miriam] Sure.

563
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,017
[in fake language] He says, "Give me
the girl, or I'll tear you apart."

564
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,142
[Stroke] This is going nowhere.

565
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,326
[in fake foreign language]
Joseph, Mary, pizza, rabbit!

566
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,750
[in fake foreign language]
Fatty fatty, phone home.

567
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:52,458
<i>Kara-karasho! Kara-karasho!</i>

568
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,750
Fatty fatty?

569
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,416
Sorry, that's you. [sighs]

And now it's the tradition.

577
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,041
This is how we settle things.

578
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,125
Man enough? Come. Come, come.

579
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,208
Place your bets!

580
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,250
The first to fall, 25 bucks!

581
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,291
- 25 bucks, first to fall!
- [laughs]

582
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,958
Place your bets. 25 bucks, first to fall.

585
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,041
[gasps] No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

586
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:50,958
It's... It's a warm-up.

587
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,791
Come on, get pumped. Go.

588
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,666

If you don't let go,

[Smiley] You know,
I could get used to circus life.

669
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,958
[Miriam giggles] No.

670
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,458
Why don't we make a pact?

671
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,583
You let me help you find your buggy,
you return the favor.

672
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,250
- Mmm.
- Hmm?

If it's necessary... [spits]

676
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,416
It was Raniero.

677
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,041
Torsillo's son.

678
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,583
I saw him with it at the bar.

679
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,708
His father's a very powerful man.

680
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,041
He has everything
but still wants more, yeah?

681
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,208
He wants to take your buggy.

682
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,666
And he wants to take our land now.

683
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,583
He paid the Cobras to threaten us.

684
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,559
Why don't you just leave then, you know?
Circus folk travel, don't they?

685
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,375
- No!
- Oh. No. Oh...

686
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,166
This is like home to us!

687
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,458
Five generations, we've lived here!

688
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,500
Man, you're sitting here
crying over a buggy

689
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,250
while this land belongs to me. Huh?

690
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,458
Hold on. Look at me.

691
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,750
It's not any old hunk of junk.

692
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:32,166
It belonged to my father.

693
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,500
Ah.

694
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,625
Looks like we're after the same thing.

695
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,500
I see. We want the same thing?

696
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,125
[chuckles softly]

697
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,875
Thanks for the information.

698
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:49,958
Hey!

699
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,250
Never forget the pact. Okay?

700
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,333
Mm-hmm.

701
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,416
It's a pact.

702
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,291

[dog barking in distance]

704
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:09,208

00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,458
What's up?

707
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,291
Uh, maybe I should head home.

708
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,851
No, no, no. Don't leave me. Hold on.
I can't go in there alone.

709
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,958
- You're crucial to the plan.
- What plan?

710
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,750
- Mine.
- Exactly. It's yours.

711
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:27,416
You don't know Torsillo.
I don't trust circus folks.

712
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,625
- You're scared, huh?
- Yeah, so scared! Brr.

713
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:33,375
You know what? If you hadn't stopped
to help those guys when we were kids,

714
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,291
the buggy would still be ours!

715
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,333
[tense music playing]

716
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,375
Come again?

717
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,875
I said, if you hadn't stopped
to help those guys when we were little,

718
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,958
the buggy would still be ours.

719
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,125
- Yeah?
- [Smiley] Yeah.

720
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,208
Mm-hmm.

721
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,767
So who's the one who gambled it away,
you dirty little cheater!

722
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:53,958
"You dirty little cheater."

723
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,059
- I don't talk like that.
- "I don't talk like that."

724
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,291
- Stop it.
- Uh, "Stop it."

725
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,166
- [grunts]
- Uh, knew it was coming.

726
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,833
- [grunting]
- Again.

727
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,583
- You know what?
- Mm?

728
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,291
- I don't wanna fight, okay?
- Ha.

729
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,291
- [screams, grunts]
- [both thud on ground]

730
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,916
- [classical music playing]
- [both grunting outside]

731
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,083
[Smiley] Okay. Okay.

732
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,708
I'll go alone. I'll go alone.

733
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,250
- But if I find the buggy, it's mine.
- [Stroke grunting]

734
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,333
[classical music continues]

735
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:35,833
[whistles in admiration]

736
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:38,166
What a shack! Hello.

737
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,708
Ah.

738
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:42,833
[tuts]

739
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,416
Go with this one. Trust me.

740
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,125
Folks,

741
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:50,708
I'm looking for Torsillo.

742
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:54,250
I wanted to bring my brother here,
but he's way too short-tempered.

743
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,833
I even told him,

744
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,625
"I think those are good people
in a place like that."

745
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,166
So, if anyone here
is the front man of this group,

746
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,541
step forward.

747
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,958
- [punch lands]
- [exhales loudly]

748
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,041
Could you let me go?

749
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,166
Okay, I'll stay here.

750
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,333
What do you need with Mr. Torsillo?

751
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,333
- Oh.
- You have a deal waiting for him too?

752
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,083
[gasps] Very close.

753
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,958
- Huh?
- Very close.

754
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,708
[Torsillo] The Torsillo Tower.

755
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,583
Boutiques, spas,
heavenly beaches, dancing,

756
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,500
all on land that costs virtually nothing.

757
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,750
With guaranteed building permits,
police who cooperate,

758
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,000
and willing to turn a blind eye
to money laundering.

759
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,250
[speaking Japanese]

760
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:43,333
[in English] Mr. Tanaka wants more info
on the property conveyance.

761
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,416
Minor details.

762
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,625
A couple residents
have yet to sign the documents,

763
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:50,333
but I assure you that
the local administration is on my side.

764
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:51,416
[munching]

765
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:52,875
Mr. Tanaka.

766
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,083
If you don't like it, then get lost.

767
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:58,583
The door is right here.
Don't let it hit you on the way out. Okay?

768
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,291
[munching]

769
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,416
Uh... [laughs]

770
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Oh my God, please... [laughs]

771
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,875
[breathes deeply]

772
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,375
Please excuse Raniero.

773
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:15,750
I know he seems like...

774
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,416
I know it's hard to believe,
but he's my only child.

775
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,583
Are you kidding?

776
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:23,416
Sorry, Pop. I thought
you wanted me to be meaner.

777
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,083
Of course. But with this group?

778
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:26,833
[speaking Japanese]

779
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,791
[chuckles] You know kids these...
He's young, and he's...

780
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:31,916
[chuckling] He's a real asshole.

781
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,541
[panting]

782
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,666
[Scajone] And so,

783
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,833
will you tell me one last thing?

784
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,375
[chuckles softly] Sure.

785
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,375
- I know he hates motorcyclists.
- Who?

786
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,458
[tense music builds up]

787
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:49,958
[gulps]

788
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,250
These are bad.

789
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,583
Hmm?

790
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,208
[Scajone groans]

791
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,833
What is this, Scaglione?

792
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,208
[grunts] Ah, I wouldn't wake him up.

793
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,125
Excuse me.

794
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,008
[Smiley] Sorry if we interrupted
your meeting,

795
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,250
but we have a little problem
to figure out.

796
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,541
Your boy has stolen my buggy.

797
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,291
Ah, pardon. Our buggy. [chuckles]

798
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,500
[clears throat]

799
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,250
A red dune buggy
that has a nice yellow soft top.

800
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,791
[Smiley] Yes, exactly.

801
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,708
Please excuse me one moment. [grunts]

802
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,666
[Stroke] We're fine here, thanks.

803
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,041
See, if you give back, uh,
our special buggy... [clears throat]

804
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,958
...we'll just leave and pretend
that this was just a big error.

805
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,161
- Forget it, Dad, let's give them...
- [Torsillo] Hey!

806
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,250
[scoffs] Or what else will you do then?

807
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,333
[scoffs]

808
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,333
[laughs]

809
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,250
- Or what would we do?
- Hmm...

810
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,291
Uh... I'm not so sure yet.

811
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,083
- [chuckles]
- [Stroke clears throat]

812
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,791
We're not sure yet. Hmm.

813
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,083
Normally, I'd have the pleasure
of slicing your throats.

814
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,708
But you're in luck,
because right now I'm in a meeting.

815
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,291
And now... now go before I change my mind.

816
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,458
And I'll make sure
that your car is back tomorrow at noon.

817
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,291
Ah.

818
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Well...

819
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,958
I'll see you at the garage.

820
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:14,166
[footsteps receding]

821
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,541
Oh, I forgot.

822
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,208
A very important thing.

823
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,333
[chuckles, grunts]

824
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,125
- Mm!
- The circus people are never leaving.

825
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,333
Hmm? Mm. See you later. Appreciate it.

826
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,291
Shall I leave it open?

827
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,625
Who would really... [chuckles]

828
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,833
[sighs] Hell of a time to find
good workers these days now.

829
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:36,916
Translate it.

830
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:38,625
Yikes.

831
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,833
- [guitar playing]
- [Stroke vocalizing song]

832
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:47,125
[continues vocalizing]

833
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:53,958
Hey! Ah!

834
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,041
[continues vocalizing]

835
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:02,875
- [scatting] Ha!
- [groovy music playing on stereo]

836
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:16,416
[turns off stereo]

837
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,666
[sighs]

838
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:21,708
[clicks tongue]

839
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:24,041
[clears throat, continues vocalizing]

840
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,875
[Smiley] Hmm.

841
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,166
[turns on stereo]

842
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,333
[music spluttering]

843
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:42,041
- [stereo shattering]
- [music stops playing]

844
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,750
[whimpering]

845
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,250
[Smiley] I'm telling you,
you'll die young at this rate.

846
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,083
And you'll die tomorrow.

847
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,750
[Smiley] What's up with you?

848
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,875
If it's Torsillo or the circus
or that I stole the model,

849
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,916
fine! I'm sorry if I didn't tell you.

850
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,541
We were only there for the car, okay?

851
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,666
Ah, okay. See, but it's only because
of Miriam that we knew where it went.

852
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,583
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:07,083
Tell you what. You think
you're the smartest guy on Earth,

854
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,046
but you're always first one
to get screwed, man.

855
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,875
I told you I was only 13 and young!

856
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:13,083
If you'd grown up,
you'd know you shouldn't make deals

857
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,126
with circus people.
They first take your finger...

858
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:16,208
[clears throat]

859
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,416
There you go.

860
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,250
- You brought my heart with you?
- [chuckles]

861
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,333
Mind if we talk?

862
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,000
You should've seen me.

863
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,125
I kicked the door open,
knocked some of them out.

864
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,083
[Miriam chuckles]

865
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,500
And then I took the model,
put it under my arm,

866
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:36,208
and said to them,
"The circus people aren't leaving."

867
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,000
- Sounds pretty good, you know?
- Yes.

868
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,458
See, but the war isn't over.

869
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:44,333
Torsillo must understand
that this land is ours.

870
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,541
So I get it, but war sounds a bit extreme.

871
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:50,041
I mean, I only want my car back.
And then we'd...

872
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,833
not complicate things with us.

873
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,291
[Miriam chuckles]

874
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,500
- I'll see ya.
- Hold on, dear.

875
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,958
See? I don't want
to complicate things either.

876
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,500
[sighs]

877
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:07,875
Hmm.

878
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,791
Mmm. Mmm.

willing to risk his own life.

Excuse me?

Who's helping me? Hmm?

No one.

So guess what?

1163
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:27,041
I'm not helping either, especially you.

1164
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,101
You've been screwing everything up
since you were five years old!

1165
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,416
And now you're still doing it!

1166
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,059
What do you think,
that with a smile and a few jokes,

1167
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,666
you would fix everything? Hmm?

1168
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,333
Well, listen.

1169
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,791
You, I'm not pissed at. I'm pissed at me.

1170
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,958
Because I always said yes
instead of saying no!

1171
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:45,083
And now this time, it's gonna be no!

1172
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,500
Okay. I took a gamble, and I lost.

1173
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,916
So excuse me. Sorry.
Once and for all, I'm sorry.

1174
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,708
But you were with me.

1175
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,250
I didn't point a gun at your head.

1176
01:02:57,916 --> 01:02:59,500
So hold yourself accountable.

1177
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:05,375

I've always hated it.

[sighs]

1592
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:30,833
That's so defeating.

1593
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,333
[sighs]

1594
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:36,791

Good. Tell me it's a good one.

1597
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,541
[assistant director] Good.

1598
01:28:47,041 --> 01:28:49,708
[director] Three, two, one!

1599
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,333
In what sense?

[both] Or else we'll...

1606
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,083
Or else we'll get mad, you know?

1607
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:14,958
We were one voice, one person.
