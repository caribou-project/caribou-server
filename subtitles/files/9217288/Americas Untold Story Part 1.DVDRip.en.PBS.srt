1
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,054
- This is the story
of America's past

2
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,240
that never made it
into textbooks.

3
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,027
- When most people
were in school,

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,565
you began American history
at Jamestown and Plymouth Rock.

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,669
- Jamestown narrative is viewed
very much in isolation,

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,938
that this was
the first encounter

7
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,008
between Europeans and Indians.

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,043
- If you really wanted to look
at the Founding Fathers,

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,468
you'd look a lot earlier,
and you'd look south.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,486
- It starts nearly a half century
before the Pilgrims landed.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,154
- The children who stepped ashore

12
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,490
probably had their own
grandchildren by the time

13
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,593
Jamestown was founded.

14
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:54,197
- Pedro Menéndez and the people
who went with him,

15
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,201
they are really the fathers
of the United States,

16
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,702
the true fathers
of the United States.

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,837
They are.

18
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:05,241
They arrived before,
before Mayflower, Jamestown.

19
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,044
- It's a story that has
taken archaeologists,

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:14,350
marine scientists and historians
several centuries to uncover.

21
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,052
- I've always thought
it was like having

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,389
a 2,000-piece jigsaw puzzle,

23
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,057
but you don't know
what the picture

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,192
is supposed to look like.

25
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,095
- This stuff has not seen
the light of day

26
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,232
for 250...

27
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,134
to 275 years.

28
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,203
- And I could feel the lip to it
and put my hands inside,

29
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,205
and then I realized what it was.

30
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,740
- This is one of the, maybe,

31
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,342
one of the most
important documents

32
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,744
in the United States
history, no?

33
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,781
If you read it, you go,
"It's a film.

34
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,015
You could make
a film out of it."

35
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:51,087
- What these discoveries reveal
is a very different America.

36
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,256
- It's multicultural
from day one.

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,624
- You had Africans.

38
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,494
You had a few Italians,
Germans, Irish priests.

39
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,230
- It really was America's
first melting pot.

40
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,666
- How did this history
become lost,

41
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,235
and how does it change
our thinking about race

42
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,239
and immigration in this country
to know what really happened?

43
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:14,644
- If you don't know your past,
you can't understand who you are

44
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,546
and where are you going.

45
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,284
- This is the rest of the story
of America's birth.

46
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,553
- It is just as much a part
of American history

47
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,656
as Washington crossing the
Delaware or Paul Revere's ride.

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,792
- If we took that as a beginning,
I think we would have

49
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,261
a very different picture

50
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,730
of the United States.

51
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,565
- What makes you American.

52
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:40,403
- This is American history,
revised.

53
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,680
♪♪

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,435
They have been walking,
night and day,

55
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,571
struggling against
fierce winds and rain

56
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,840
that had already proven deadly.

57
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,442
- It's a massive storm.

58
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,311
No matter how hard they tried
to claw their way out,

59
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:26,215
they kept on being pushed back.

60
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,452
- 500 of them, making their
way through swamps

61
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,721
and unfamiliar terrain,

62
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,705
passing creatures
they've never seen before.

63
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,197
- They're marching through, in
some cases up to their waists,

64
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,333
in some cases higher,
up to their chest,

65
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,503
through flooded swamp land.

66
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,604
- During the course of the march,

67
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,873
about 100 of his troops
dropped out.

68
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,341
They didn't make it.

69
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,477
- And, waiting for them
at the end of it all,

70
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,647
a battle they might not survive.

71
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,583
- And the stage is set for this
really very rapid

72
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,553
and very bloody end game.

73
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,672
- This wasn't the journey
they had signed on for.

74
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:14,163
It had started as a dream
to settle a new territory,

75
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,766
more than 4,000 miles
across the ocean,

76
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,634
a venture that first began

77
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,904
in this modern-day
seaport town of Avilés

78
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,374
in Northern Spain.

79
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,543
450 years ago,

80
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,280
Avilés was an important
maritime center,

81
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:35,384
and ship-building
was its main industry.

82
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,520
Hundreds of young men
grew up learning

83
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,656
how to navigate
along these shores.

84
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,861
One of them was Pedro Menéndez,
who became, over time,

85
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,320
one of the king's
most trusted men.

86
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,401
- The royal family trusted him

87
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,971
for their most
important missions.

88
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,939
He spoke English,
which was not very common

89
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,742
for a Spaniard at the time.

90
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,744
He was a Renaissance man.

91
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,980
He was a great seaman.

92
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:09,685
- He understood the winds,
the waves and the weather

93
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,989
better than almost
anyone at the time.

94
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,825
- Little was known about
Menéndez or his influence

95
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:19,228
on American history
until Dr. Eugene Lyon

96
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,332
began combing through Spanish
archives in the 1960s.

97
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,969
<i>- El dicho,
Pedro Menéndez de Avilés.</i>

98
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,705
- Lyon spent 6 years in Spain,

99
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,775
microfilming more than
a million pages of material,

100
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,577
and another decade translating

101
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,979
and piecing these
accounts together.

102
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,851
- Any new document
is like finding a treasure.

103
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,988
It's the only real
treasure there is.

104
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,492
- What emerged is a story
that radically changes

105
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:54,530
our understanding
of this country's roots.

106
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,901
The year was 1565,
and the entire East Coast

107
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,536
of what is now the United States

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,941
was Spanish territory
known as La Florida.

109
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,743
It stretched north
to Nova Scotia,

110
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,346
and all the way west
to the Mississippi,

111
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,883
and along the gulf coast
of Mexico to Texas.

112
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,386
This had been Spanish territory
ever since Juan Ponce de León

113
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,606
had claimed it in 1513.

114
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,927
King Phillip Il
wanted to establish

115
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,896
a strategic foothold here

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,666
to prevent other countries from
encroaching on Spanish land,

117
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,638
and he wanted to deter attacks
on his Spanish treasure fleets.

118
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:41,944
- One main reason was to protect
the homebound Spanish fleets

119
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,382
bearing the riches
of the mines of Mexico

120
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,919
and the great silver
mountain in Peru.

121
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,521
- Pedro Menéndez had once
been a Captain General

122
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,657
of those treasure ships.

123
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,694
- These were dangerous waters
and ships often struck sandbars,

124
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:03,666
and the survivors
were taken captive.

125
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,536
Some died in captivity,
some were made slaves.

126
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,339
- For several years, Menéndez
has been seeking permission

127
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,874
to go to La Florida

128
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:16,078
to search for survivors
of one of those lost ships.

129
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,682
- His son had been a sea captain
who had sailed one or two years

130
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,451
earlier from Havana
into a hurricane,

131
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,687
and he was lost
on the Florida coast.

132
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,957
- The Crown had repeatedly
refused those requests,

133
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,093
but Menéndez was not
easily discouraged.

134
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,564
- He was good at making decisions
and taking quick action.

135
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,767
- Menéndez
was also an entrepreneur,

136
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,470
and he saw the potential
of developing the New World.

137
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,972
Raising his own capital,

138
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,708
he proposed an
ambitious undertaking,

139
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,977
one that was different
from the conquistadors

140
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,845
who had gone before.

141
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,849
Menéndez proposed to
transplant thousands of people,

142
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,852
along with the infrastructure
of an entire town,

143
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,487
to La Florida.

144
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,491
He would create a colony
that would be self-sustaining

145
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,661
and produce its own
goods for export,

146
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,497
a venture that stood
to add considerable wealth

147
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,001
to Spain's coffers.

148
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,869
But there was another reason
the king wanted

149
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,639
to start settling
this new territory,

150
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,141
and it went back more
than half a century

151
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,411
to Columbus' first voyage.

152
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,648
- For the Spaniards at this time,
religion is the driving force.

153
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,784
Christ can't come back until
the whole world is evangelized.

154
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,887
- History books have focused
on other motivations,

155
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,623
the drive to explore
the New World,

156
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,159
the desire to
plunder its riches,

157
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,529
but Columbus was also
a fervent Christian

158
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,632
who believed his explorations
could play a role

159
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,168
in fulfilling
Biblical prophecies.

160
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,040
- So, those prophecies are saying
that, "Christ is coming back.

161
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,542
We have to evangelize the world,

162
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,946
and the monarchs of Spain
will in fact be

163
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,915
at the forefront
of the Apocalypse

164
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,051
when they re-take Jerusalem."

165
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,319
- Columbus was convinced

166
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:08,190
that this would be the ultimate
legacy of the Spanish Crown.

167
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,725
For the next 73 years,

168
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,561
Spanish conquistadors
would continue to explore

169
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,730
the East Coast of North America

170
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,199
on behalf of
the Spanish monarchy.

171
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,236
Not all of them shared
this spiritual quest,

172
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,204
but Pedro Menéndez did.

173
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,674
- When he spoke to the king
at court, he said,

174
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,745
"Such grief seizes me
when I behold

175
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,715
those large communities

176
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,950
of native peoples in Florida,

177
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,821
who are sunk in the thickest
shades of infidelity

178
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,823
that I would give
anything to be able

179
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,225
to take Christianity to them

180
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,630
and redeem their
lives and souls."

181
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,499
- That resonated profoundly
with King Phillip,

182
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,834
who was such a devout Catholic

183
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,569
that he'd commissioned
a basilica

184
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,105
to be built inside
his own palace.

185
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,606
It was specially designed

186
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,276
so that his bedroom
overlooked the altar,

187
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,013
allowing the king
to hear mass recited daily,

188
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:09,518
even years later,
as he lay on his deathbed.

189
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:14,256
- He was certainly devout,
almost a frenetic supporter

190
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,727
of the Catholic Church
everywhere.

191
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,197
- But there was little chance
that religious missions

192
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,732
would succeed in La Florida.

193
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,735
So far, no one in Europe
had been able to survive

194
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,072
long-term in this
inhospitable land.

195
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:39,014
♪♪

196
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,649
- Florida was a challenge.

197
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,619
There had already been 10 to 12

198
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,755
Crown-sanctioned
expeditions into Florida

199
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,226
to establish permanence,
from Ponce de León forward,

200
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,650
and no one had been
able to do this.

201
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,103
- The rest had failed.

202
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,639
They finally ran out
of supplies and died,

203
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,175
or were killed by the Indians,
or they had to leave.

204
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:11,313
- When the last failed leader
sailed home to Spain,

205
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,084
Tristán de Luna y Arellano,
he said to Menéndez,

206
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,654
"Florida is not
worth another try.

207
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,191
There is nothing there.
The land is not arable.

208
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:26,195
The harbors are too
barred with sandbars.

209
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,831
It's a waste of men
and resources

210
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,933
to go back to that place.

211
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,737
It was just too difficult
living there,

212
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,696
scratching out a living."

213
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,211
- The king offered
several inducements.

214
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:46,682
Menéndez could claim
53,000 acres as his own.

215
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,986
He would be made Governor,
and Adelantado.

216
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,356
- Which literally means,
"he who goes before others,"

217
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,225
and was a title of nobility,

218
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,961
and that was granted
to him in perpetuity,

219
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,364
that he could pass on, then,
to his heirs, forever.

220
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,967
- And the Crown offered
other incentives

221
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,369
for anyone else
willing to go along.

222
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,705
- Menéndez and all those
associated

223
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,240
with the Florida venture

224
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:17,012
were exempt from taxes
and a series of taxes for years,

225
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,148
ten years in some instances.

226
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,717
- They held out the promise that
they would have their own land,

227
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,752
and that was hard
for an ordinary person,

228
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,120
sometimes, to acquire in Spain,

229
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,114
so this possibility would
have lured a lot of people.

230
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,130
- The expedition would
require eight ships,

231
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,800
carrying more than 1,500 people,

232
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,736
and enough provisions
to sustain the colonists

233
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,855
until they could produce
their own food and supplies.

234
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:50,279
- You have tailors,
hat makers, shoe makers,

235
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,281
surgeons and barbers.

236
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,416
One of the last
individuals on the list

237
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,152
is a master beer brewer.

238
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,322
- There would be soldiers on
board to protect the settlement,

239
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,225
26 families, 7 priests,

240
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,894
and a virtual melting
pot of immigrants.

241
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:11,300
- There were Spaniards,
Portuguese, English, French,

242
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:16,171
we see Flemish,
Germans and Africans.

243
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,906
- There are some Black
translators

244
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,042
that have been rescued
as shipwreck victims

245
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,977
from among the Indian villages,

246
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,447
and so it's multicultural
from day one.

247
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,450
- Once he'd gotten this
new settlement started,

248
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:33,122
Menéndez hoped to finally be
able to search for his son.

249
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,924
- He must have loved
his son, Juan,

250
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,062
very much to have undertaken
this great effort

251
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:43,198
as a means of finding Juan.

252
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:47,936
- But just before the journey
began, there was troubling news.

253
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,406
- The French had
established a fort

254
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,842
smack in the middle
of Spanish-claimed Florida.

255
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,378
This was an insult to the king,

256
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,081
and he became quite angry
at this trespass

257
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,216
because he had in place a treaty

258
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,088
which recognized Spain's right
to the whole Atlantic coast.

259
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,823
- Suddenly, overnight,

260
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,493
the venture turned
into a combat mission.

261
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:16,298
- "You are to drive them out by
whatever means you see fit."

262
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,834
- Fortified with hundreds
more soldiers,

263
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,968
Menéndez was now in a race

264
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,224
to beat the French Captain,
Jean Ribault, to Florida.

265
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,911
Ribault was headed there
with supply ships

266
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,146
to fortify Fort Caroline,

267
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,049
the small settlement
that France had just set up

268
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:38,987
near the mouth of the river
known today as the St. Johns.

269
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,056
It's a matter of debate
among historians

270
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,126
how accurate the depictions
of that time are,

271
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,528
but what isn't in question
are the accounts

272
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,399
of how evenly matched
these two rivals were.

273
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:54,069
Jean Ribault was
a formidable adversary.

274
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:59,007
- Sounds a lot like Menéndez,
great danger to the Spaniards.

275
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,610
- French settlers were running
out of food

276
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,945
and adequate supplies.

277
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,414
Fort Caroline was
barely holding on.

278
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,350
If Ribault did not reach there
with reinforcements,

279
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,019
the fort could be easily taken.

280
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,021
- But, of course, this venture
does not unfold the way

281
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,891
that Menéndez
expects it to unfold.

282
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,095
- His enterprise of Florida
really went wrong

283
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,297
from the get-go, in many ways.

284
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,299
- Hurricanes struck

285
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,835
as soon as the Spanish ships
got out to sea.

286
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,571
- At about a quarter of the way
across the Atlantic,

287
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,375
all but five of those ships
were either sunk at sea

288
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,977
or driven back to port.

289
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,579
Only five ships
would reach Florida.

290
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,915
- One of his main supply ships,
<i>La Victoria,</i>

291
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,919
is wrecked on Guadalupe
and all the supplies are lost,

292
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,189
and the whole crew
is lost to drowning.

293
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,459
- Only about half of the
original 1,500 passengers

294
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,327
made it to La Florida.

295
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,197
The ships headed directly
to Fort Caroline,

296
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,532
but they were too late.

297
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,968
Jean Ribault had already
beaten them there.

298
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:04,339
- So, as Ribault is unloading
his three smallest ships

299
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,308
on the River of May,

300
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,076
the St. John's River,
the Spanish show up.

301
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,478
They identify themselves.

302
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,213
They fire shots.

303
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,081
The four French ships
that are offshore

304
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,150
cut their anchor
lines to escape.

305
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,251
- Menéndez could not follow

306
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:21,089
because his ships were laden
with supplies and men.

307
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,158
- Menéndez retreated to an inlet,

308
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,961
about 40 miles south
of Fort Caroline,

309
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,497
hoping it would
provide safe harbor,

310
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,500
but Menéndez couldn't
get his main supply ships

311
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,368
past the shoal.

312
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,505
They unloaded as much as
they could into smaller boats

313
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,574
and went ashore.

314
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,976
- And the first thing
he did ashore was,

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,045
essentially,
went about the business

316
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,369
of legally establishing the
settlement of St. Augustine.

317
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,389
- Much of our knowledge
of what happened next comes

318
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,658
from a document
that is housed here,

319
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,929
in the Archives of the Indies,
in Sevilla, Spain.

320

♪♪

321
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,275
- The fact that it
survives is amazing.

322
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,144
You know, the fact
that it's even here.

323
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,014
- It is the original diary
of one of the priests

324
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,184
who accompanied Pedro Menéndez
on the voyage.

325
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,553
For several centuries,
American historians

326
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,688
knew nothing of its contents,

327
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,426
which is one of several reasons
why the story has gone untold.

328
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,428
It's only been in the past
few decades

329
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,731
that a small number
of scholars have learned

330
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,433
how to read this archaic script.

331
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,436
Dr. Michael Francis, from
The University of South Florida

332
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,306
at St. Petersburg,
is one of them.

333
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,312
- I, Francisco López de Mendoza
Grajales, chaplain,

334
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,481
give my word

335
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,450
that everything said

336
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:00,188
in this account is true.

337
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,592
Fantastic.

338
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:07,596
- In vivid detail, Father López
described the great pageantry

339
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,765
that marked the landing.

340
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,734
- There were trumpet salutes,

341
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:18,674
and the firing of cannon
and flags waving everywhere.

342
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,634
Father López was there
to greet each one.

343
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,151
- Menéndez christened the new
settlement San Augustine,

344
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,619
or St. Augustine.

345
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:35,357
It was September 8, 1565.

346
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,360
- Traditionally, the Spanish
representative of the king

347
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,497
would go to the flag,
plant the flag in the ground,

348
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,501
and proclaim the land
in the name of the king.

349
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,705
He, however, went over
to Father López

350
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,140
and knelt down
and kissed the cross.

351
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,110
So he proclaimed the land
in <i>nombre de Deus,</i>

352
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,812
in the name of God,

353
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,581
before the name of his king.

354
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,117
A little bit risky, maybe.

355
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,254
- As Menéndez and those
after him came up,

356
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:11,526
those arrivals knelt
and kissed the cross,

357
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,196
and López observed

358
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,533
the Natives imitated
all they saw done.

359
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,583
Now there is a picture for you.

360
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,542
- Father López then conducted
a mass of thanksgiving...

361
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,549
and Menéndez ordered that
a meal be prepared for everyone,

362
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,185
including the Natives.

363
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,689
- They were fed with what was
on board Menéndez's ship,

364
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:44,626
so the Indians would have
had European food...

365
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,163
Garbanzos, garlic,
olive oil, vinegar,

366
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,298
maybe some sort of salted meat

367
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,234
that they would have
brought with them.

368
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,103
- This was 55 years
before the Pilgrims

369
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,607
even arrived in Plymouth.

370
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,308
Dr. Michael Gannon,

371
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,578
one of the country's leading
scholars of Florida history,

372
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,582
drew fire a few years ago,
when he called this meal,

373
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,719
"the true first Thanksgiving."

374
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:15,590
- There was a guy who called me
from WBZ, in Boston,

375
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,894
he said, "While I'm talking,
do you realize

376
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,229
that there's
an emergency meeting

377
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,732
of select men at Plymouth

378
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,600
to contend with
this new information

379
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,335
that there were
Spaniards in Florida

380
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,138
before there were Englishmen
in Massachusetts?"

381
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,641
And then he said,
"Well, you know

382
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,676
how you've become known
up here, in New England?"

383
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,677
And I said, "No."

384
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,146
He said, "The Grinch
who stole Thanksgiving."

385
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,919
- But while the Spanish
were celebrating

386
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,620
their new settlement,

387
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,103
Jean Ribault was
planning his next move.

388
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,495
- He says, "We need to stage
a preemptive strike.

389
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,631
We need to hit the Spanish
now, as hard as we can,

390
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,900
before they entrench
themselves."

391
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,637
- Ribault left a small number
of men to guard Fort Caroline,

392
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,907
then set out with
the others on four ships,

393
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,910
looking for the Spanish camp.

394
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,914
- They had it in mind to kill
everybody at St. Augustine.

395
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,916
"Cursed Spaniards,
we will hang them

396
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,653
from the halyards
of their own ships.

397
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:23,425
The French show up off
the bar at St. Augustine

398
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:28,330
and, all of a sudden, this huge
storm bears down on them.

399
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,699
- Ribault's ships couldn't
make it over the sandbar

400
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,400
at St. Augustine,

401
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,203
and his surprise attack failed.

402
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:39,541
He decided, instead, to chase
after those large supply ships

403
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:43,311
which Menéndez had just
sent south to safety.

404
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,815
But the Spanish vessels
managed to elude the French.

405
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,819
Ribault's ships were
ravaged by the storm.

406
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,688
- And, of course,
they were shipwrecked.

407
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:57,225
All of those Frenchmen,
from Daytona Beach to a point

408
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,294
just north of Cape Canaveral.

409
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,962
- They probably lost
most of their weapons,

410
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,831
most of their food.

411
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,301
They don't really know what to
do expect to try to march back

412
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,570
and try to get back
to Fort Caroline.

413
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:12,874
Now, unbeknownst to them,
Menéndez also makes a bold move.

414
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,244
- Menéndez figured that,
"The weather is nasty.

415
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,748
I bet you that Ribault
basically stripped the garrison

416
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,584
at Fort Caroline
to come down here,

417
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:26,855
so that fort is probably
under-manned right now.

418
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,325
This is my chance. I need to go.
I need to take this fort now."

419
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,863
- Some historians say
it was a hurricane,

420
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,465
others believe
it was a nor'easter.

421
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,481
Either one could
have proven lethal.

422
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,406
- Most of the accounts allege

423
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,875
that few of the Spaniards
wanted to go.

424
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:51,479
Obviously, there was a terrible
storm, the rain is pelting down

425
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,747
and they don't think
they can make it,

426
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,516
and they don't quite know
how far it is,

427
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,618
and they think
that they'll perish.

428
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,887
And Menéndez says,
"We're going."

429
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,690
- This was his best
time to attack,

430
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:05,293
and that was typical Menéndez.

431
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,429
- It was September 18th.

432
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,932
They had only been in this
new land for 10 days.

433
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:15,770
- So he marched, and he had
squads of axemen

434
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,972
who were in the vanguard,

435
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:21,076
and they would cut where it
was necessary to get through

436
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,899
because it wasn't
very easy going.

437
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,784
- It must have been horrible,
in full armor,

438
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,787
carrying your weapons, to march
through Florida wilderness

439
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:37,525
during a hurricane took
a lot of determination.

440
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,663
- So when he came up on the fort,
he had about 400 men.

441
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:47,802
They were cold,
no doubt, hungry, ornery.

442
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,338
- It took them about
two days to get there,

443
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,073
walking throughout the night.

444
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,808
Father López wrote,

445
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,945
"They arrived within a quarter
of a league of the enemy's fort,

446
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:02,584
where they remained all night,
up to their waists in water."

447
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,952
- At the break of dawn,

448
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:08,857
they essentially charged
the gates and broke in,

449
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:14,362
and the French
were mostly asleep.

450
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:18,566
- The sound of the rain
somehow allowed the Spanish

451
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,101
to get right up to the fort.

452
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,905
It masked the sound
of approaching soldiers.

453
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,608
- They really caught the fort
completely by surprise.

454
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,110
The French never dreamed
that they would face

455
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,845
an enemy during this storm.

456
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,048
They figured everyone
would be battered down

457
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,583
just like they were.
- The French were all asleep,

458
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,385
some in their night clothes,

459
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,453
some of them were
completely naked,

460
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,655
and the slaughter began.

461
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,706
- Only a few escaped
into the woods.

462
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,898
Menéndez and his men
collected the spoils of war...

463
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,099
Food, weapons,

464
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:55,003
and a chest with the French
king's orders for the fort,

465
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,740
which violated Spain's
claim to La Florida.

466
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,942
They also found Lutheran texts,

467
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,612
which the Spanish Catholics
considered heresy.

468
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:09,617
- The French Huguenots were
a real threat to Catholicism.

469
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,687
The Huguenots,
or the Protestant group,

470
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,189
was obtaining a lot of power.

471
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:19,060
- It makes, in that worldview,
total sense to eliminate someone

472
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:24,065
who is not only a political
and economic challenge,

473
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:27,936
but also a religious challenge
to your very reason of being,

474
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,572
as a Catholic.

475
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,875
- "The greatest triumph,"
Father López wrote,

476
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,812
"will be the Holy Gospel being
introduced into this country,

477
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:42,951
a thing necessary to prevent
the loss of many souls."

478
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,453
- We're dealing with people
from a different era.

479
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,155
This is what people thought.

480
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,690
This is what they believed.

481
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,691
This is what they hoped for,

482
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,560
that all things would be
made new in Christ,

483
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,129
and suffering would
come to an end,

484
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,563
and there would be
finally the peace

485
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,833
that had been prophesied
in the Scriptures.

486
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,669
- Menéndez provided a ship
so the women and children

487
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,105
that he spared
could leave safely.

488
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:08,476
He renamed the fort San Mateo,
or St. Matthew.

489
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,579
He left some of his soldiers
there to guard the fort,

490
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,717
and took the rest back
to St. Augustine.

491
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,887
A little more than a week later,
about half of the Frenchmen,

492
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,590
who had survived the shipwrecks
off the coast of Cape Canaveral,

493
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,895
were trying to make their way
back to Fort Caroline on foot.

494
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,599
Jean Ribault was
not one of them.

495
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,134
- But when they got
to Matanzas Inlet

496
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,637
they were unable to cross it,

497
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,907
and Native people in that region

498
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,143
saw that these Frenchmen
were stranded there,

499
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:46,881
and ran up to St. Augustine
to advise the Spaniards,

500
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,784
and Menéndez went
down with 50 men.

501
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:53,621
- Menéndez told the French that
their fort had been destroyed.

502
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,657
- The French, at this point,
would just be happy

503
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,158
to surrender unconditionally

504
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,295
and be given a ship
and sail back to France.

505
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,164
- Menéndez said,
"Tell your commander

506
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,634
that you can come over,

507
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,037
10 at a time, in my boat,

508
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,774
and I will deal with you
as good captain should."

509
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,809
And that's the only
promise he made to them.

510
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:20,715
- "Your fate will be what God
tells me in my good conscience."

511
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,784
- Menéndez had his men
bring the French

512
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,052
across the Matanzas River

513
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:27,188
by boat, 10 at a time.

514
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,792
When the Frenchmen disembarked
on the other side of the water,

515
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,928
the Spanish tied their
hands behind their backs,

516
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,864
and marched them to a point

517
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:39,067
where Menéndez had drawn
a line in the sand.

518
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,737
- Menéndez had situated
his men behind the sand dunes

519
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,206
with daggers and spears,

520
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,711
and when each group
of 10 was brought over,

521
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:53,715
Menéndez's men set
upon them and killed them.

522
00:27:53,739 --> 00:28:00,270
And soon it was 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, the bodies piled up.

523
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,961
- Menéndez spared a few
of the French, mostly craftsmen,

524
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:11,232
who's skills could be put to use
building the new settlement.

525
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,269
- He says that the total
number of Lutherans

526
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:18,306
killed were 111 men,

527
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,379
and that there were 14 or 15
that were taken captive.

528
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,271
- Father López's account
ends at this point...

529
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,388
but another document

530
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:37,125
continues the story
even further.

531
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:41,729
- We kept these documents,
and here they are.

532
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,266
- Don Alvaro Armada
is the Count of Guemes

533
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,069
and a descendant
of Pedro Menéndez.

534
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,406
His family archive houses
over a million pages

535
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,741
of handwritten documents.

536
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,045
One of them is a full account
of the expedition,

537
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,881
written by
Gonzalo Solis de Merás,

538
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,116
who was Menéndez's
brother-in-law.

539
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,286
- This is one of the, maybe one
of the most important documents

540
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,889
in the United States
history, no?

541
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,959
- It describes the fateful day,
two weeks after the slaughter

542
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:14,162
of the first group
of French shipwreck survivors,

543
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,932
and Jean Ribault and about 200
of his remaining soldiers

544
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,769
met face-to-face
with Pedro Menéndez.

545
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,339
They met at the sand dunes
about 14 miles

546
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,041
south of Saint Augustine.

547
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,979
It was October 11, 1565.

548
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,314
- Menéndez then informs
Ribault, of course,

549
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,717
that he's already captured
Fort Caroline.

550
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,186
There's nowhere
for Ribault to go.

551
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:43,057
The fort has fallen and Ribault
tries to negotiate safe passage

552
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,926
back to France,

553
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,329
and then offers a...

554
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,064
- An amount of money, no?
- Yeah. He offers...

555
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,733
- An amount of money.
- Yeah. A lot.

556
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:52,800
- And Menéndez said "No."

557
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,068
- No.

558
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,205
- Jean Ribault then
recited a psalm.

559
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,742
- He begins to say a prayer,

560
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,077
and after he finishes...

561
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,388
So he's saying to them
that we are all of this earth

562
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,390
and to this earth
we shall return.

563
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,025
- He's saying goodbye.

564
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:21,496
- So that within 20 years
all of this will be a tale,

565
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,500
a story, a legend.

566
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,436
- If you read it, you go,
"It's a film."

567
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,371
You can make a film
out of it, no?

568
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,106
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

569
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,842
- And then he looks at Menéndez,
and he says...

570
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,850
So he's telling the
adelantado, Menéndez,

571
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,003
"Do with us as you will."

572
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:55,396
Menéndez is quite open
about what happens.

573
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,868
Menéndez simply says, "I could
not risk keeping Ribault

574
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,452
and the principle
officers alive."

575
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,876
- When a war is a war
you kill everybody,

576
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,547
but he didn't kill
women or children.

577
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,152
So some of the residents
in Saint Augustine

578
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,956
felt that what he had done
was excessively cruel.

579
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,025
So, others saying that
what he had done

580
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,561
was the act of a great captain.

581
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,296
- It was a very calculated
choice.

582
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,568
He did not have the food that
would be required to feed them.

583
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:37,472
He did not have arms
sufficient to guard them.

584
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,575
These hoards of Frenchmen
could overwhelm his forces

585
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,110
at almost any time,

586
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,847
so he made
a calculated decision,

587
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,449
and this was it...
Either kill these people

588
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,051
or be killed by them.

589
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,321
- So as many as 350 men
were massacred,

590
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:57,325
and that's how we get the name
Matanzas Inlet, Matanzas River.

591
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:01,309
That's "massacre"
or "slaughter" in Spanish.

592
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,200
- Jean Ribault's last words,

593
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,070
that someday this
would all be legend,

594
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,205
proved to be ironic.

595
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,840
For centuries the true story

596
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,610
of America's beginnings
went untold.

597
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:20,948
American history textbooks
do not even give it a mention.

598
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,986
- Pedro Menéndez and the people
that went with him,

599
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:29,157
they are really the fathers
of the United States,

600
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,625
the true fathers
of the United States.

601
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:31,959
They are.

602
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,562
They are, because very simple.

603
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:40,368
They arrived before Mayflower,
Jamestown and all that.

604
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,103
The story shouldn't be invented.

605
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,239
It can't be invented
because here are the documents.

606
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,442
Here are the documents.

607
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,513
- The search for the missing
pieces of this story

608
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,515
continues today.

609
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,983
A team of divers from

610
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,653
the Lighthouse
Archaeological Maritime Program

611
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:03,257
are off the coast of Cape
Canaveral National Seashore.

612
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,027
They are looking for
those fateful shipwrecks

613
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,895
that not only cost Jean Ribault

614
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,132
and his men the conquest
of the new world,

615
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,402
but ultimately their lives.

616
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,205
- We have, for example,
a letter from Pedro Menéndez

617
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,040
to the king of Spain

618
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,410
reporting that he has
taken Fort Caroline

619
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,278
and that the French ships
have wrecked,

620
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,148
and he gives a very
rough estimate

621
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,150
of how many leagues away
from Saint Augustine they are,

622
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,285
so that kind of
puts us in the general area.

623
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,988
- They have honed in
on an area near shore

624
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,124
where small artifacts
believed to have belonged

625
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,927
to Ribault's men were found.

626
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,130
- The shipwreck survivors
who made it ashore

627
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,533
had some kind of campsite there
and there's a lot of artifacts.

628
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:48,469
There are coins dating 1550s,

629
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,339
and there's actually one
coin that is dated 1565.

630
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,441
That's the magic number.

631
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:57,144
- Ribault's ships were carrying
large quantities of iron,

632
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,313
cannons and ammunition.

633
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,716
The team uses a high-powered
metal detector

634
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,352
that penetrates deep water.

635
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,153
- There we go.
So now the line... There we go.

636
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,355
- There it is.

637
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,223
- You can't miss that.

638
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,691
There was definitely
something there.

639
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,461
- But it's not what
they're looking for.

640
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,297
- At night the coast,
all the coastline

641
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,565
south of us is just dark,

642
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:22,303
and it really feels just like it
must have felt 450 years ago.

643
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:26,207
You can imagine there were
bodies washing ashore.

644
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,977
There was flotsam and debris
from the shipwrecks all ashore.

645
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,445
There was probably
a horrible stench.

646
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,181
I mean, you can really start
to picture it in your mind.

647
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,484
All of the hopes of these people

648
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:40,721
who are really the first to come
over to seek the American dream,

649
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,190
and it all came down
to this storm,

650
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:48,195
this fateful storm that just
dashed their hopes to pieces.

651
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,398
- More than a year later,
a breakthrough

652
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,534
just south of the area
the team had been searching.

653
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,603
- Treasure hunters have
apparently found

654
00:34:55,627 --> 00:35:00,207
the nearly 500-year-old
remains of <i>La Trinite.</i>

655
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,744
- News programs reported that a
private treasure hunting company

656
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,213
had unearthed
three bronze cannons

657
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,616
belonged to belong
to Ribault's fleet.

658
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,486
- There really is no doubt
to any of the archaeologists

659
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,088
who have really looked

660
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,757
at what has been found
that this is the <i>Trinite</i>

661
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,093
or certainly one
of Ribault's ships,

662
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,228
so it's a very exciting find.

663
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,432
So this is the cannon
in question,

664
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:28,536
and here's the H with the crown
above it for King Henry Il.

665
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,241
The biggest smoking gun that has
been found was a stone pillar.

666
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,776
- It's a stone column
like the one

667
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,113
depicted in this
16th century etching.

668
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,248
The columns were used
to mark territory

669
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,784
when the French arrived
in the new world.

670
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:49,123
- We know a pillar very much
like this one was established

671
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,592
in the area of the River of May,
where Fort Caroline is,

672
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,260
so present day Jacksonville,

673
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,129
and we know that Ribault

674
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,131
loaded six more

675
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,133
of these stone pillars
on to his fleet.

676
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,434
And it's amazing.

677
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,537
It's striking image of the one
that's in the de Bry engraving.

678
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,273
- France has laid claim
to the shipwreck

679
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,309
and is in talks
with archaeologists,

680
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,344
including Chuck Meide's team,

681
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,813
to assist with the excavation.

682
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,582
- Until someone invents
a time machine,

683
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:18,152
the best way to immerse
ourselves in that life,

684
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,286
that time period,

685
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,555
that experience
on a particular vessel

686
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,691
is through maritime archeology.

687
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,726
- Ironically, these ships
have been sitting

688
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,828
at the bottom
of the ocean buried

689
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,699
under rocket ship debris
just a few miles from the place

690
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,300
where modern day explorers

691
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,303
are launched in to space.

692
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,472
- They were the space shuttles
of their time period.

693
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,307
I mean, these were the ships
that were launched

694
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:44,311
to explore the great unknown.

695
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,313
- Meide expects it to take
several years

696
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,581
to excavate the ships

697
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,718
and several more years
to have some answers.

698
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:54,588
What kind of preparations
did Ribault make for his attack?

699
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,191
Could he have out-gunned
the Spanish

700
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,047
if it hadn't been for the storm?

701
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,234
♪♪

702
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:11,539
Back on land in Saint Augustine,
Dr. Kathleen Deagan

703
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,675
and a team of archaeologists
from the University of Florida

704
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,344
have unearthed a major new find

705
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,880
about what happened
to those first settlers

706
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,751
who came over
with Pedro Menéndez.

707
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:24,819
- I've always thought
it was like

708
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,756
having a 2,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle,

709
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,424
but you don't know
that the picture

710
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,359
is supposed to look like.

711
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,894
- Deagan has already uncovered

712
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,497
some of the most pivotal
archaeological sites

713
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,366
in this country's early history.

714
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,801
- It's really only
through archeology

715
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:44,772
that we know
what regular people did.

716
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,640
I've always thought
of archeology

717
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,643
as the most democratic
form of history

718
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,947
because it isn't
just what the people

719
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,782
who knew how to write say,

720
00:37:54,806 --> 00:38:00,421
and it isn't just what
a more elite class

721
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,791
of people left behind.

722
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,393
- After working at the site
for several years,

723
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,464
Deagan and her team found a well
that was typical of European

724
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,400
rather than Native American
construction.

725
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,203
Its contents led them to believe

726
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,440
that this was the site
of the first settlement

727
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,209
when Menéndez first came ashore.

728
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,878
- At first
we couldn't believe it.

729
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,413
We said, "No. This couldn't have
been here all this time,"

730
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,683
and here we've been
working for over 30 years

731
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,585
on and off at this site.

732
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,321
- They found the site while
digging at the Fountain of Youth

733
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:38,559
Archaeological Park
just north of downtown.

734
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:44,598
- It was enough mass to convince
us even after 30 years

735
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,334
that it really was
the Menéndez settlement.

736
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,470
- They found hundreds
of artifacts,

737
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:53,607
including Spanish beads,
musket balls, belt loops,

738
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:58,512
fragments of medicine
vials and uniform buttons.

739
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,848
- It really wasn't until
some of the kind

740
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,450
of smoking-gun artifacts

741
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,854
and archaeological
deposits showed up

742
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:10,257
that you would really
let yourself say,

743
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,358
"This is it."

744
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,328
Its real significance
is that it's the first place

745
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,530
in the United States

746
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,266
that Europeans came and stayed.

747
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,269
- And there's evidence of the
children who first came here,

748
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,470
as well.

749
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,007
- We found a little figa amulet,

750
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,343
which is a little clenched fist

751
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,478
with the thumb
between the fingers,

752
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,749
and Spanish women
had many of these

753
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,885
hanging around babies necks

754
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,688
to protect them
against evil eye,

755
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,490
and we just couldn't
help imagining

756
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,760
that this was associated
with the first European child

757
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,430
born in what's now
the United States,

758
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,632
Martinico de Arguelles.

759
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,768
- And we have references
to children being born

760
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,905
in Saint Augustine obviously
soon after people arrive.

761
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:01,041
- Dr. Susan Parker scours
parish records

762
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,444
now housed in Saint Augustine

763
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:06,680
to reconstruct the lives
of ordinary people.

764
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,517
- It's just whatever you can find
to try to piece them together

765
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,788
and give a voice
and a face to many people

766
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:18,525
that wouldn't have a voice
and a face otherwise.

767
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,596
- Women and children are often
missing from official accounts,

768
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,932
but Parker has managed
to breathe life in

769
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,601
to these first families
through their letters

770
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,338
back to Spain and vital records.

771
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,841
- I think we need to remember
that it's 42 years

772
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,443
between when Saint Augustine
was founded

773
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,446
and when Jamestown is founded.

774
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,415
If we look at that
in a different way,

775
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,817
that's almost two generations.

776
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,420
In other words, the children
who stepped to shore,

777
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,722
however many children there
were, with Pedro Menéndez

778
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,358
probably had their own
grandchildren by the time

779
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,894
Jamestown was founded.

780
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,364
- Another discovery, the
important role native women

781
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,567
played in providing food
for the new colony.

782
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,037
- We have found
the remains of foods

783
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:06,373
that they must have
learned about the foods

784
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:10,878
and how to fix them from
the native people in the area,

785
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:15,115
and this, I think,
is a real indication

786
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,984
that Native American women,

787
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:22,389
even though they were invisible
in much of the document record,

788
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,025
really shaped the actual
life experiences

789
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,895
of everyone in these colonies.

790
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,798
- At first, the relationship
between the natives

791
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,534
and Spanish settlers
was a good one.

792
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,637
It's said the Timucuan
Indian chief named Soloy

793
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,873
gave Pedro Menéndez
his own council house,

794
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:43,610
big enough to hold
hundreds of people.

795
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,013
- In this GIS map
just happens to show

796
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,149
where all the post molds
and big pits are.

797
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,485
- It's believed that an
archaeologist may have

798
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,822
discovered
this round house in the 1950s,

799
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,891
but his findings
were never published.

800
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,661
All of those records recently
turned up in a garage

801
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:04,765
in California
nearly 70 years later.

802
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:08,035
Deagan and her team plan
to search for that round house,

803
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:11,638
but in the meantime,
they've made another discovery.

804
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,775
Deagan believes they may
have found the walls

805
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:18,112
of this settlement's first fort.

806
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:22,516
- In 1565, the ground surface
would have been somewhere

807
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,452
in this area,

808
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,054
and this is where, for example,

809
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:32,126
if somebody was standing
and dug this hole for a wall,

810
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,795
their feet would have been.

811
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:38,532
- Menéndez ordered a fort
to be built just before he left

812
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,534
to start up other
fortified settlements

813
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,538
along the east coast.

814
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,840
He was gone
more than four months,

815
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,834
but by winter, rations and
supplies were becoming scarce.

816
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:57,584
- They complained of starvation
and Indian attacks,

817
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,953
and most of the people
who came here with Menéndez

818
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,023
came because they assumed
they would have a better life.

819
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,224
They would have livestock.

820
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,026
They might find gold and riches.

821
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,861
They would have
their own piece of land,

822
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,864
but none of that ever happened.

823
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,866
- A group of discontented
soldiers

824
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,602
began plotting a mutiny.

825
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,005
- So within six months
of arriving,

826
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:22,176
most of the soldiers decided
that they had enough,

827
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,611
and said "We're just going
to capture a boat.

828
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,015
We're going to get the supplies.
We're going to get out of here."

829
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,785
- At midnight, rebels marched
with torches and guns,

830
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,620
looting Saint Augustine's
store room

831
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,758
and loading weapons on board
a ship headed for Spain.

832
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:42,296
- They tied up the quartermaster
and took off with the weaponry

833
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,631
and some of the supplies
on a ship,

834
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:49,036
but the quartermaster was able
to get himself free

835
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,171
with the help of a few
other loyal soldiers,

836
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,808
and he shot at the mutineers.

837
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:58,045
He did quell the mutiny.

838
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:02,234
- The leader of the uprising was
immediately hanged for treason.

839
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,922
Pedro Menéndez returned
two weeks later with food

840
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,791
and additional troops.

841
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:15,062
He pardoned those willing
to swear allegiance to him.

842
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,799
Those who didn't could take
their chances on their own

843
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,335
without a ship or provisions.

844
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,070
- He gave them a choice.

845
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:29,076
They chose, for the most part,
to go back to Menéndez.

846
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,079
- But it wasn't just the soldiers
who were unhappy.

847
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:36,817
Evidence of burnt structures
confirms another dark truth...

848
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:41,588
That the goodwill with the
natives lasted less than a year.

849
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,725
- The Timucua, after nine months,

850
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,693
attacked and burnt part
of the settlement,

851
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,829
and that's when
it was abandoned.

852
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,232
- The settlers had overstayed
their welcome.

853
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:57,971
♪♪

854
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,841
The settlers moved across
the river to a small piece

855
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:05,612
of land now known
as Anastasia Island.

856
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,881
The structure that used
to be Fort Caroline

857
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,317
remained to the north
on the mainland

858
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:14,121
with just a small number
of soldiers guarding it.

859
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,189
Three years later,

860
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,192
a Frenchman by the name
of Dominique de Gourgue

861
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:23,263
brought his own band of men back
to Florida to exact revenge.

862
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:28,669
- He claims, "I arrived in
Fort Caroline, what is our fort,

863
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:31,271
that the Spanish had renamed
Fort San Mateo,

864
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:35,742
and I surprised them,
and I killed all 200 soldiers,

865
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,277
hanged them at the fort,

866
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,879
and burned the fort
to the ground

867
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,148
and stole all of their
artillery,

868
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:44,151
and vengeance is ours."

869
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:48,155
- De Gourgue claimed to have
used a searing iron

870
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:51,758
to burn a message for the
Spanish in to one of the tables.

871
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:55,195
- He said, "I do not do this
as unto Spaniards,

872
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,032
but as unto traitors
and robbers and murderers."

873
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,169
But, of course, there is
no burned table at the fort.

874
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,438
In fact, there are not
200 soldiers at the fort.

875
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:07,674
There were 100 soldiers
stationed at the fort

876
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,942
when he arrived,

877
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:12,045
and when they heard
the cannon fire

878
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:15,315
from the mouth of
the Saint John's river,

879
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:19,820
every single one of those
soldiers packed their supplies

880
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,788
and they left,

881
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,057
and they all made it
to Saint Augustine.

882
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,312
- The fort was never rebuilt.

883
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:32,199
Very little is known about life
in Saint Augustine

884
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:36,203
during the years the settlers
lived on Anastasia Island.

885
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:39,206
No one has ever found
remains of the settlement

886
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,075
which may be buried
underwater now.

887
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:47,214
Around 1572, they returned
to the other side of the river

888
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,883
and took up residence where
the city of Saint Augustine's

889
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,351
historical district

890
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,488
is located today.

891
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:57,824
As for Pedro Menéndez, he had
been traveling up and down

892
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,360
the East Coast
during most of this time

893
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,730
establishing a second colony
in South Carolina

894
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,233
and 13 more forts,

895
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:10,003
but by 1574,
only the two settlements,

896
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:14,908
Santa Elena
and Saint Augustine remained.

897
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:19,379
In all that time,
Menéndez never found his son.

898
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,915
He returned to Spain and was
preparing to command

899
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,984
another fleet for the king,

900
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,520
but exactly
nine years to the day

901
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:28,121
after he marched his troops

902
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:31,458
through a deadly storm
and captured Fort Caroline,

903
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:36,129
Pedro Menéndez died at home
in Spain of typhus.

904
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,532
He was 55.

905
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,867
- At the end, he's a romantic.

906
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,403
He's not a person who's looking
for the jewels or the...

907
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,440
He doesn't care about that.

908
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,008
When he died he was ruined.

909
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,276
No money.
No money.

910
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,912
He spent all his money
on his adventures.

911
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,915
He's not a materialist.

912
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:56,283
He's an...

913
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,321
He's an idealist.

914
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:05,492
He catches my heart.

915
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:08,161
- Over the next decade,
Saint Augustine

916
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,430
began to transform
in to the city

917
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,933
that Menéndez had envisioned.

918
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,469
Residents built a town
square patterned

919
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:18,972
after the plazas in Spain.

920
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:24,311
- The Plaza, I call it the heart
and soul of Saint Augustine.

921
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,847
Just about everything important
would take place there.

922
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,983
The religious festivals
would take place in the plaza.

923
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,587
Any military parades
or gatherings

924
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,455
would take place in the plaza.

925
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,925
- The plaza also housed
the marketplace.

926
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,327
- And because the market
was there,

927
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:44,498
we have the first known
regulation of weights

928
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:46,133
and measures,
so I kind of think of it

929
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:49,924
as the first consumer
protection laws in the nation.

930
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:57,344
- We found street deposits
that date back to the late 1500s

931
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:59,346
or early 1600s.

932
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:03,417
- Carl Halbirt has overseen Saint
Augustine's archeology program

933
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,385
for more than 25 years.

934
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,621
It's one of the few cities
in the country

935
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,224
that requires an archaeological
dig be conducted

936
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,494
before any new
construction can begin.

937
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:18,498
- Aviles Street is the
oldest documented

938
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:21,401
European street
in the United States,

939
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:26,106
and Philadelphia said,
"Oh, we have the oldest street."

940
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,241
I said, "Philly can
eat my dust."

941
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,911
Clearly we beat them
by 100 years.

942
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,380
- Across from the plaza
on Aviles Street

943
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:35,649
stood the centerpiece
of it all...

944
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:39,386
The first parish church
in the United States.

945
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:43,523
- It was the first building
that one saw

946
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:47,994
as one entered the inlet
in to the harbor.

947
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,162
- Picture yourself.
You're on a ship.

948
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,999
It takes a month, two months,
to come across the ocean,

949
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,468
terrible, deplorable conditions,

950
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:58,405
food, sanitation,
fright from storms, pirates,

951
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:02,409
and you come to Saint Augustine,
and what do they see?

952
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:05,078
- They would see the church
and the cross

953
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:09,950
and know that their Christian
home was just ahead of them.

954
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:15,288
Religion really was an integral
part of their very being,

955
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:19,025
and you can't exaggerate the
place it took in their lives.

956
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,429
- The church also played a role
in the blending of cultures.

957
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:26,566
Spanish soldiers began
to marry native women.

958
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,035
- The main thing that had
to happen first

959
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,037
was that you be a Catholic.

960
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,039
Either you convert or you
already were a Catholic,

961
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:37,711
and so these men, you know,
married women who converted,

962
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,479
who became Catholics.

963
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,382
- 20 to 25 percent
of the marriages

964
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:46,319
recorded were between a Spaniard
and a Native American.

965
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,990
- There was a lot of
intermarriage because they felt

966
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:51,458
that these people
were human beings

967
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,059
just like them.

968
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,061
There was such a huge difference

969
00:50:55,085 --> 00:51:00,534
in the acceptance of that
in the Spanish colonies

970
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,169
rather than in
the British colonies.

971
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,473
- In fact, the artifacts
discovered throughout the city

972
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:10,677
reveal some startling truths
about this country's roots...

973
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,346
That the population
in America's first colony

974
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,150
was a mix of races and cultures
more closely reassembling

975
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,353
the diversity of
America's population today,

976
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:25,025
not the Anglo version that's
been depicted in textbooks.

977
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,761
- Why did Spanish America emerge

978
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:30,363
with such a different
kind of society

979
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,532
than English America?

980
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,001
I believe that it has
a great deal to do

981
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:38,505
with the integration of other
people in to Spanish society

982
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,707
and the exclusion
of other people

983
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:43,777
from Anglo-American society.

984
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:47,380
If you really looked at the way
people lived

985
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,650
in colonial English America,

986
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,587
you would only see
English things,

987
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:57,257
English traditions and
English objects and food.

988
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:02,429
Most of us look to that
as our history, our origins.

989
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,265
In the Spanish world,
it looked very different.

990
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,268
It was very multicultural
and very integrated.

991
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,670
- You had people
from the Canary Islands.

992
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,472
You had Africans.

993
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:15,208
You had some converted Jews.

994
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:19,713
You had a few Italians,
Germans, Irish priests.

995
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,549
- And it really was America's
first melting pot.

996
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:24,417
- So it's very strange, really,

997
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,900
that that whole part
of the history was eliminated.

998
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,693
- I think that the
United States is richer.

999
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,161
Its history is richer

1000
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:39,165
because of the existence
of Saint Augustine,

1001
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,167
of the establishment of it.

1002
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:46,640
It demonstrated that African
and European people

1003
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,708
could live together,

1004
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:52,712
could benefit from
each other's skills.

1005
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:57,217
That as a beginning
for the United States,

1006
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:59,586
if we took that as a beginning,

1007
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,656
I think we would have
a very different picture

1008
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,191
of the United States.

1009
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:08,194
- Two decades after
Saint Augustine was founded,

1010
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,598
it had become a thriving
16th century town

1011
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:15,201
complete with shops,
inns and taverns,

1012
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:19,873
but all of this was
about to be destroyed.

1013
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:23,476
Suddenly, one day in June 1586,

1014
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,479
a foreboding sight
appeared on the horizon.

1015
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,481
- People looked out
over the inlet

1016
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:33,820
and saw 23 heavily
armed warships.

1017
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:38,758
19 auxiliary vessels
which contained 2,000 armed men.

1018
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:42,228
- This was the fleet of the
notorious English pirate,

1019
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:46,766
Sir Francis Drake, known
the Spanish as a vicious foe.

1020
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,637
- He had come to attack,
seize, destroy,

1021
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:55,241
pillage the Spanish city
of Saint Augustine.

1022
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:58,378
- To the Spanish,
Drake was known as a monster.

1023
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,346
- You Spanish bastards!

1024
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,616
- As a merciless man,
as a power-hungry man,

1025
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,452
as an avaricious man,

1026
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:08,521
as an inhuman individual,
really.

1027
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,459
- The word Drake was... to the
Spanish, he was a terrorist.

1028
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:14,194
He was an international
terrorist.

1029
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:20,266
- The citizens of Saint Augustine
were out-manned and out-gunned.

1030
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,668
- You're the enemy.

1031
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:25,271
- How could they
possibly survive?

1032
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,273
- You're either with us
