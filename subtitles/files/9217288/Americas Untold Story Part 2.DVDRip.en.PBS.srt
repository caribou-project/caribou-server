resistance to these Christian

He was known as Don Juanillo,
or Little John.

to take a second wife,

575

"I don't think so."

696

- Another example is
from The Confessionario,

697
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:25,186
a document written by Father
Pareja to help friars decide

698
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,889
whether someone had sinned
in the eyes of the church.

699
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,860
- There is a whole series
of what are called superstitions

700
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,295
in The Confessionario,

701
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,897
and the priest is supposed
to ask the Timucua,

702
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,766
"Are you doing this?
Are you doing that?"

703
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,737
One, for example, says, "Do you
take the antlers of the deer

704
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,606
and praying
believe that you will then

705
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,576
be able to catch another deer

706
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,178
as part of this
devil's ceremony?"

707
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,682
So that's the Spanish,
but the Timucua leaves out

708
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,384
any reference to the devil,

709
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,756
so when the Timucua person
puts it into Timucua,

00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,794
he or she drops the whole
demon part of the text.

the creator, the breath-giver.

to define what the devil was.
