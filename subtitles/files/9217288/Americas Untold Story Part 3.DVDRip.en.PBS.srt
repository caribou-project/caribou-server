it shatters violently,
the fragments will fly off,

192
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:55,838
whereas coquina doesn't shatter

193

00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,689
why the fort was able
to withstand artillery fire

200
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,525
while other structures
could not.

201
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,893
- The principle behind

202
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,863
why it withstood so elegantly
and majestically

203
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,667
is simply coquina was able
to absorb energy locally,

204
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,770
not sending the energy
to a global region,

205
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,839
which is fracture.

206
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:33,909
- The coquina walls are composed
of compressed-shell fragments,

207
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,879
bonded together
over thousands of years.

208

That's all.

212
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,889
- The tiny shells crumble,
absorbing impact,

213
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,059
so bullets and cannonballs
sank into the Castillo,

214

the walls.

The community was located

if you think of it only as an
enslaved-plantation experience.

740
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,724
- It's very difficult
to understand U.S. history

741

I think it's...

When you start to integrate

744
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,597
the narratives
about the experiences,

745
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,167
for example, of Africans
in the United States,

746
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,669
and you fail to look
at the Africans in Florida,

747
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,606
you get a very distorted
picture of what's unfolding.

748

- The new, fortified settlement
had its own church

749
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,747
and was comprised
of skilled blacksmiths,

750
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:25,619
carpenters, cattlemen,
boatmen, and farmers.

751
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:29,023
- This was a rough frontier.
It wasn't easy for anybody.

752
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,392
So, I don't mean to glamorize it

by saying people
were made free here.

754
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:37,264
Sometimes, the food supplies

Sometimes,
there were epidemic diseases

00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,235

black and white alike

757
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,170
and Indians worse.

758
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,607
It's not easy, but it's
at least the possibility

not worrying that their children

763
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,518
Those sorts of things
are quite different.

764
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,822
- In the 1970s, Dr. Jane Landers
was just a graduate student

765
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,326
when she discovered documents
in the archives of Spain

766
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,528
describing the settlement.

767
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:12,166
- One day, I almost jumped
because I came across a census

768
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,670
of the town of Gracia Real
de Santa Teresa de Mose,

769
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,339
and it was household
by household,

770
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:21,709
exactly who lived
in the households,

771
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,544
you know, whether
they were already converted

772
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,580
or on their way
to full Catholicism.

773
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,115
And I was able, finally,

774
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,451
to get the full picture
of the community.

775
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,187
- She found a treasure trove.

776
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:39,160
Most historians have thought
that African-American life

777
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,562
was totally almost undocumented.

778
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,831
They were really
the people without history.

779
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:49,303
She was able to find census data
and information

780
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,105
about where the people came from

781
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,774
and what they did
and their names and ages,

782
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,177
and that was tremendously
exciting for us.

783
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,713
- When I brought all this back
and made some reports on it,

784
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,783
then the archaeologists
could start digging.

785
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,318
- Yeah, but unless it's...

786
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,221
- Dr. Kathleen Deagan
led the dig.

787
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:11,192
- We were then able to work
with some of her information

788
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:13,460
and do large-scale surveys

789
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:18,599
and low-level
aerial satellite imagery

790
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:21,702
and verify that this place

791
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:26,273
we thought probably
was Fort Mose really was.

792
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,576
- Deagan's and Landers' findings

793
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,511
gave a glimpse
of what life was like

794
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,547
in the first
free black settlement

795
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,483
in what is now
the United States.

796
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,920
- They had fields
outside of a fort.

797
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,622
They grew crops.

798
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,624
They had animals.
They fished.

799
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,626
They gathered cattle...

800
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,729
Wild cattle roaming
in the hinterlands.

801
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,932
They rode horseback through
the woods all the time.

802
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,836
They were pilots, and they were,
you know, corsairs.

803
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,240
- I think that the United States
is richer.

804
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:03,177
Its history is richer
because it demonstrated

805
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:07,281
that African and European people
could live together,

806
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:11,252
could benefit
from each other's skills,

807
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,554
and that, as a beginning,

808
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,523
I think we would have
a very different picture

809
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,226
of the United States.

810
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,694
- What I think
is really important

811
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,931
is it's a story
of empowerment and of freedom.

812
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,267
I think it's such
a different narrative

813
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,536
than saying everybody got off
a slave ship, bedraggled,

814
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,740
and sweated
in a cotton field somewhere.

815
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,943
This is centuries of other kinds
of experience, and it...

816
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,835
I think it is important
to show that, too.

817
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,983
- The location of Fort Mose
at the edge of town

818
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,286
was an important defensive move.

819
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,455
There was no better soldier
to defend St. Augustine

820
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:52,226
than a man who did not want
to become enslaved again.

821
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,994
- They have every motive
and impetus

822
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,631
to fight hard
against any British attacks.

823
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,301
- Well, we know that
they're going to fight

824
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,704
and they're gonna fight
to the death

825
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:07,341
against their former oppressors.

826
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:10,377
- The militia at Fort Mose
would soon be tested.

827
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,646
A year after the town
was established,

828
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,816
the largest slave uprising
in the British mainland colonies

829
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,252
erupted in South Carolina.

830
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,354
- On the ground, it's personal.

831
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,823
You know, people who thought
they had slaves...

832
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,725
They're running away to Florida.

833
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:27,795
They're angry.
They want to come get them.

834
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,830
- Finally, King George Il

835
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,400
ordered Georgia's troops
to take St. Augustine

836
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,837
and end the practice
of harboring runaway slaves.

837
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:41,308
- They were adamant
that this place had to fall,

838
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,544
so they had to be wiped out.

839
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,613
- General James Oglethorpe
had founded Georgia

840
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,549
and had been its first governor.

841
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,417
Although he was actually
against slavery,

842
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,852
he'd been anxious

843
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,688
to take La Florida
away from the Spanish for years.

844
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,757
- He’s very close
to St. Augustine

845
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,759
and even moves down
to put some forts

846
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,527
near the mouth
of the St. Johns River,

847
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:04,665
so he actually comes into
what is today Florida.

848
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,668
- King George
commanded Oglethorpe to, quote,

849
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,770
"spare no personal danger

850
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,739
in exacting revenge
on those slaves

851
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,408
who had fled their owners."

852
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:16,777
Francisco Menendez
had successfully led

853
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:19,713
several attacks on the British
before this,

854
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,515
but when Governor Montiano heard

855
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,451
that the English were coming
to avenge the slave owners,

856
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,388
he feared for the safety
of the people at Fort Mose.

857
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:30,357
- So, he orders them
to abandon Mose

858
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,559
and to come into St. Augustine
for their protection,

859
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,894
because he figures

860
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:37,331
they'll either be all killed
and/or captured.

861
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:39,400
And so, they come into
St. Augustine,

862
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,935
and the British just walk right
into Fort Mose and take over.

863
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,573
- But 16 days later, the Spanish,

864
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,543
the black militia,
and the Native allies returned.

865
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,945
They caught the British
by surprise at daybreak

866
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,548
and easily retook the fort.

867
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:59,586
The British called it
the Battle of Bloody Mose.

868
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,721
- There's a quote
by Shakespeare...

869
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,689
"Some are born great,

870
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,491
some achieve greatness,

871
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,561
and some have greatness
