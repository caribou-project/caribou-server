3
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,682
- It was the dawn

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,051
of a new era
for the British Empire.

5
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,787
For the first time since
Spanish conquistadors

6
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,991
claimed La Florida
250 years earlier,

7
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,894
all of the Atlantic Coast
of North America

8
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,730
was finally under the control
of Great Britain.

9
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,999
- We all know about
the 13 British colonies.

10
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,634
But at the time
of the Revolution,

11
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,170
there weren't 13 British
colonies... there were 15.

12
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,806
Nobody knows that, hardly.

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,277
- Spain had given up
La Florida in 1763

14
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,346
in exchange for recovering
Cuba from the British.

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,318
England created East and West
Florida as royal colonies,

16
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,753
making them the 14th

17
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,221
and 15th British colonies

18
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,689
in North America,

19
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,659
that would later
become part of the U.S.

20
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,194
East Florida stretched
from the Atlantic

21
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,363
to the Apalachicola River.

22
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,698
St. Augustine,

23
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,800
now 300 buildings strong,

24
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,368
was the capital.

25
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,204
West Florida, with the smaller
settlement of Pensacola

26
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,606
as the capital,

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,141
reached to the Mississippi.

28
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,243
- East Florida and West Florida
have been completely

29
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,878
written out of the narrative.

30
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,947
Search "13 British colonies"

31
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:48,184
and you will not find
numbers 14 and 15.

32
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,254
- It was a radical
changing of the guard.

33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,390
The scrappy melting pot
of European, Native,

34
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,092
and black communities

35
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,296
that had eked out a rough
frontier life under Spanish rule

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,100
had evacuated
to Mexico and Cuba.

37
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,103
And stepping in to govern
the colony of East Florida

38
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,373
was a British aristocrat,
Colonel James Grant,

39
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,909
heir apparent of
Ballindalloch Castle

40
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,178
in the Scottish Highlands.

41
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,781
Grant was literally
of the manor born,

42
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,151
growing up on this 10,000-acre
estate in Speyside,

43
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,154
which has been kept
in the family for centuries.

44
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,191
Many of the rooms
remain as they were

45
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,728
when the castle
was built in 1545.

46
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:35,231
- I always think it's such
a shame the walls can't talk.

47
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,433
'Cause think of
the wonderful stories

48
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,737
that must be in every room.

49
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,940
- Grant left is comfortable life
here to fight for his country

50
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,942
when he was 24.

51
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,444
- He was a very big military man.

52
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,714
He was obviously very bright.

53
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,082
He had a great estate.

54
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,185
He had lots of servants
to look after him.

55
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,221
And he needn't have done that.

56
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:04,093
He could've stayed here
on the estate and done nothing.

57
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,430
- Grant left the lush,
rolling hills of Scotland

58
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:11,367
for the relentless heat
and sandy soil of East Florida,

59
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,203
hoping to transform
this unmanageable territory

60
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,440
into a viable British
trade colony.

61
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,410
The governor of West Florida
was another aristocrat

62
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,912
who had been a commander
in the Royal Navy.

63
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,314
Commodore George Johnstone
had a reputation

64
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,252
for being hot-tempered,
scheming, and duplicitous.

65
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,421
But he was vigorous
about encouraging trade

66
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,456
in the new colony.

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,459
- Here was a subtropical region
that suddenly they had

68
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,027
that might
potentially allow them

69
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,196
to grow some sort of fruits
or vegetables

70
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,198
they would have
to go elsewhere for.

71
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,802
- They saw East Florida
and West Florida

72
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,171
as an extension
of the Caribbean.

73
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:52,909
So they saw
agricultural profits.

74
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,345
- Many of the missing pieces
of the story of British Florida

75
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,750
were hidden in the attic turret
at Ballindalloch Castle,

76
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,819
buried among thousands
of other papers

77
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,255
that had been stored there
and forgotten for centuries.

78
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,991
In the 1970s,
Grant's descendants

79
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,327
asked the Scottish
National Archives

80
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,429
to inventory what was there.

81
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:17,867
A decade later, Dr. Dan Schafer
was allowed access to the papers

82
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,070
and began methodically
reconstructing the history

83
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,106
of British Florida.

84
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,373
- That's where the records were.

85
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,210
The whole James Grant
letter collection

86
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:31,414
were in the castle
in a far attic,

87
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,051
in the cold, in a room where
they were stored very well,

88
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,121
but nobody knew they were there.

89
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,958
This country, I am convinced
is totally unknown.

90
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,393
- Grant's letters describe
East Florida

91
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,462
as completely undeveloped,

92
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,966
still in a state of nature
when he arrived.

93
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,400
And since only three families

94
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,137
remained after
the Spanish left St. Augustine,

95
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:58,107
Grant had no one to help harness
the wilderness beyond town.

96
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,343
- How are you going to
develop a province

97
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,279
when there's nobody here?

98
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,882
- Grant began by offering
free land

99
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,985
to successful plantation
owners in other colonies.

100
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,419
- He would say,
"We have better climate.

101
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,588
We have better everything
than you have there.

102
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,223
Come here."

103
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,225
- The British-sanctioned
land grants were anywhere

104
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,196
from 100 acres
to 20,000-acre parcels.

105
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,031
- Well, if they come in
to St. Augustine

106
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,835
and find a dismal place
and have a terrible time,

107
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:31,974
they're not gonna come,
so he lit up their night life.

108
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,476
- He was a bachelor.

109
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,514
And he had one of the largest
collections of wine

110
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,183
in this area.

111
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,185
And by "this area,"
I'm talking about North America.

112
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,923
He had three slaves who were
trained in French culinary arts.

113
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,959
And he threw a party
probably four,

114
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,061
five nights out of the week.

115
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,963
- Yeah, he was quite a party guy.

116
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,465
Every month,
he would do inventory

117
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,501
of the Governor's cellars.

118
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,069
And if you were to see that,

- West Florida was desperately
in need of settlers, too.

But its governor was not
as charismatic as Grant.

146

And the presence of
some 28,000 Natives

147

Europeans wary of moving there.

from the St. Marys River
in Georgia to a region

which they introduced
into colonial Florida

167

20% of that group

00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:04,086
There's a tremendous
loss of life.

178
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,522
- These are the books
of the burials

179
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,626
of the people of color
at Santa Mosé.

180
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,827
- For several years,

181
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,530
Dr. Jane Landers
of Vanderbilt University

182
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,334
has been tracking the fate
of the residents of Fort Mose

183
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,403
after they arrived in Cuba.

184
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,607
- You can track epidemic disease
through these burial records

185
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,543
and see that so many people
are buried on the same day,

186
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,313
and sometimes they even
tell you what disease.

187
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,283
- Landers is working with a team
of graduate students

188
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,285
to digitize the records.

189
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,188
- We're trying to get as many
of the oldest books

190
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,790
preserved as possible.

191
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,259
As you can see, especially
from that other book

192
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,828
we're working on there,
they're very fragile.

193
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,730
They're old.

194
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,799
They're disappearing as we're
talking and filming here today.

195
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,301
Some of them look like lace.

196
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,569
Climate is a problem.

197
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,171
It's hot and humid.

198
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,505
Bugs are a problem.

199
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,141
So, you'll see worm paths
through the paper.

200
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,876
Fires occasionally.

201
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,412
Sometimes people don't know
what was in those records

202
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,449
and they got tossed.

203
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,552
At one point, there was
no roof on this church,

204
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,754
and everything was
exposed to the air.

205
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,657
They moved the books
to the safest place they could

206
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,859
and they've since
put back a roof.

207
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,662
But all of that damages records,

208
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,731
and some of them
have not survived.

209
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,302
- Landers' team has found that
disease wasn't the only reason

210
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,505
why so many of the refugees
from Florida died here.

211
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,807
- They'd already undergone
so many disruptions.

212
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,376
They'd been moved,
they'd been under attack.

213
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,447
- And some of it may just be
emotional distress, as well.

214
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,749
Especially for the older people.

215
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,253
- And those indigenous tribes
that had gone to Cuba

216
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:48,491
to avoid being enslaved by the
British were also in jeopardy.

217
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,495
- There were 89 Timucua
and Guale Indians

218
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,196
who left with the Spanish.

219
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,123
And within six years,
more than half of them had died.

220
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:03,606
- So Guanabacoa has an important
history also for Florida

221
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,277
as the last resting place
of many of the Florida Indians.

222
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,613
- And as for Francisco Menendez,

223
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:14,650
about a year after he
and his family arrived in Cuba,

224
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,652
the trail goes cold.

225
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,656
- And I'm trying
to track Menendez.

226
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,359
You can see when they give up
their homestead

227
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,396
because you can see them making
payments, and at some point,

228
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,234
they sort of disappear
off of that account book.

229
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,538
- So far, Landers has been unable
to find his grave

230
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,674
in any of the church
cemeteries in Cuba.

231
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,167
We may never know
what happened to him.

232
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,916
Back in East Florida,
illness forced Governor Grant

233
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,785
to return to England
for medical care.

234
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,388
Two years later, he was
elected to Parliament

235
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,256
and resigned as governor.

236
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,294
A new leader was appointed,
Colonel Patrick Tonyn,

237
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,298
who ran into opposition
almost immediately.

238
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:06,769
- He was the nastiest person
I've ever read a letter from.

239
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,470
He hated everybody.

240
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,539
He had a chip on his shoulder
the size of Ireland.

241
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,910
- Such a vindictive nature that
he had, and so self-serving.

242
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,313
I find it really hard
to like the man.

243
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,749
- Tonyn drew resistance
from several of Grant's friends,

244
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,486
including one who publicly
insulted Tonyn's wife.

245
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,590
- He announced, "I will not
allow my wife and daughters

246
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,925
to interact with Mrs. Tonyn.

247
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,695
I knew her in Scotland,
and she was a whore."

248
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:36,465
So the gauntlet was thrown
immediately.

249
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,835
And Tonyn never forgot.
He never forgave.

250
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:44,006
- Several clashed with Tonyn
over the issue of governance.

251
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,575
The colonists believed
they had the same rights

252
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,477
as they had had in Britain,

253
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,749
such as electing representatives
to a colonial house of assembly.

254
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,487
Tonyn viewed such demands
as disloyalty to the Crown.

255
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,624
Former governor Grant
wrote letters back to Florida

256
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,992
assuring his friends

257
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,395
that his successor would
soon win them over...

258
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,630
but he didn't.

259
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,632
- "You predicted that
Governor Tonyn

260
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,634
would bring all into good humor

261
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,637
and drowned animosity
in a bottle of claret.

262
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,773
You're quite mistaken
in your man.

263
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,709
I went to one of
his first parties

264
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,014
and he served bad food
on a dirty tablecloth,"

265
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:31,086
and then continues with, "in all
the comfort of a dirty whore."

266
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,657
- Tonyn lost even more ground
when he began to mistreat

267
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,527
the three domestic slaves he had
promised to purchase from Grant.

268
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,396
- Do you understand me?!

269
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,466
- Alexander, who Governor Grant
had trained to be a prized baker

270
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,603
for all these great affairs,
dinners, that he was having,

271
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,640
was punished by putting
an iron mask around his head

272
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,475
that padlocked in the back.

273
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,644
"Alexander stopped me
in the street.

274
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,913
He complains of the iron caps.

275
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,450
He wishes very much
to be your baker again.

276
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,086
He complains that madame
is the devil.

277
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,822
But since I saw him,
he has had the cap put on

278
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,357
and been flogged."

279
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,659
- Alexander and the two
other slaves

280
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,695
eventually ran away
to the woods.

281
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,530
When Grant heard about this,

282
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:18,701
he insisted that they be given
sanctuary at his own plantation.

283
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,970
- "You are publicly to make it
known that Governor Tonyn

284
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,841
has nothing to do with them,
that they have nothing to fear."

285
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,509
Which is a most
remarkable thing.

286
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,845
To rebuke the other
governor publicly

287
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,814
was a remarkable thing to do.

288
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,083
- But ironically,
just a few years later,

289
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,586
Tonyn would cast himself
as a great liberator,

290
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,422
and in doing so,
he would turn people against

291
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,025
one of his more vocal critics.

292
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,427
That man was
Dr. Andrew Turnbull,

293
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:49,131
who ran the largest plantation
in all of North America.

294
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:53,102
- Turnbull is dreaming big,
big dreams, amazing dreams,

295
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,105
and he had no idea the troubles
that lay ahead of him.

296
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,774
- Educated at the University
of Edinburgh,

297
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,878
Turnbull studied medicine
there when he was only 13.

298
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,048
When the British started
offering land grants in Florida,

299
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,584
Turnbull and his two
wealthy partners

300
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,919
were granted over 100,000 acres.

301
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,456
- There's nothing like that
in colonial American history.

302
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,192
This is just massive
in its scale.

303
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,896
- Turnbull personally recruited
indentured workers from Menorca,

304
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,732
as well as Turkey,
Greece, and Italy.

305
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,468
More than 1,400 people.

306
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,637
- "And I'm going away
as fast as possible,

307
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,774
as the Governor has
taken umbrage at my taking

308
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,876
so many people from his place.

309
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,979
I beg Sir William that you will
not say any of this

310
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,480
until you hear from me

311
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,817
after I've gotten
safely away from here."

312
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,886
If the Turks had apprehended
and jailed him,

313
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,621
he wouldn't have gotten
out of that jail,

314
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,222
or they would've killed him.

315
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,192
- Many of those who signed
on were fleeing famine

316
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,662
and drought in
their own homelands.

317
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,063
- Everything would be
paid for them.

318
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,667
He would provide transportation,
food, provisions.

319
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,737
And once they arrived
in Florida,

320
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,640
then they would begin to work
under contract for him.

321
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,643
They would be
indentured laborers.

322
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,812
- For a while, Turnbull
turned the colony

323
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,181
into a successful
indigo plantation.

324
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,249
- Accomplished on a huge scale

325
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,520
development of plantation-based
economy with export products

326
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,823
that are baffling in size.

327
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,692
- Turnbull was influential
back in England.

328
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,762
When he criticized
East Florida's governance,

329
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,630
Tonyn was reprimanded.

330
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,767
- So there was a real clash
between these two men.

331
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,603
And if you were Tonyn, you would
have some hard feelings

332
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,740
if Turnbull tried to get
you fired, which he did.

333
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,876
- But nine years after it began,

334
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,079
the Turnbull venture
was finished.

335
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,814
- It was a terrible failure,

336
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,717
actually, because about
half of his labor force died

337
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,820
within four years
of leaving Europe.

338
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,691
They faced devastating drought,

339
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,862
hurricane, money shortages,

340
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:03,699
inability to buy things.

341
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,268
- Turnbull's accounts,
as well as his record

342
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,670
of the number of lives lost,

343
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,574
are housed in the Dundee
City Archives in Scotland.

344
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,810
- And it's one of the saddest
of all the documents

345
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,246
that you'll find
in this entire archive

346
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,716
at the Dundee collection.

347
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,623
"Males... 406 left alive.
Females... 296 left alive."

348
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,058
- Within two years after Turnbull
had brought

349
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,693
more than 1,400 people

350
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,864
over from the Mediterranean,
half had died.

351
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,634
The desperation of
his workers grew worse

352
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,870
when Turnbull returned
to England on business

353
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,706
and left his overseers
in charge.

354
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,311
- Increasingly, the behavior
of the overseers and guards

355
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:53,649
toward the indentured servants
was unfair,

356
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,050
approaching on criminal.

357
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,320
The workforce
was just completely

358
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,756
depressed psychologically.

359
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,092
One of the Menorcan group
gather together a couple

360
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:08,330
of other Menorcans and sneaked
out of the encampment one night,

361
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:11,800
walked up the beach
to Anastasia Island,

362
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,670
swam across the river
to St. Augustine,

363
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,372
and approached
the English governor,

364
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:22,377
begging him to do something
to redress their grievances.

365
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,280
- Governor Tonyn seized
the opportunity to get revenge

366
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,952
on this man who had so openly
defied his authority.

367
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:34,156
- Governor Tonyn hated Turnbull
so badly, and the first thing

368
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,727
Tonyn did was he had a notary
taking the sworn affidavits.

369
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,630
- Turnbull was portrayed
as a monster.

370
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,265
- And of course,

371
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,802
he becomes a most hated figure
in British-colonial history.

372
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,839
- The complaints launched against
the overseers included rape,

373
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,774
beatings, and floggings.

374
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,377
- They accuse him of whipping,
that he whipped people.

375
00:18:55,401 --> 00:19:00,816
They accuse him
of starving his laborers.

376
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,019
- The stories were very similar
in the affidavits.

377
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,154
I mean, there were people who...

378
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,856
you know, pregnant women beaten.

379
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,660
There were who had brothers
who were beaten to death.

380
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,997
- And many of these people
were imprisoned.

381
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,832
Some were executed.

382
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:20,869
- Turnbull later defended himself
against these accusations.

383
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,371
- His defense is interesting.

384
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:28,010
His defense is, "Look, if I was
so brutal to them,

385
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,680
how can it be then that
my children and my wife

386
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,049
were not vindictively killed

387
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,851
while I was away
for three years?"

388
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,819
- The infraction Tonyn
was able to get him on

389
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,756
was enslaving white people.

390
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,058
You could indenture them,
but they had a contract.

391
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,993
Contracts have ending dates,

392
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,962
and they swore
in their affidavits

393
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,164
he had illegally kept them
beyond their dates,

394
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,401
and that's where Tonyn said,
"I've got him."

395
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,737
- Turnbull maintained he would
have honored his contract

396
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,406
once the debts were paid.

397
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,341
The court agreed with him.

398
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,879
Nevertheless, Turnbull's alleged
brutality became legendary,

399
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:07,082
and his plantation was
eventually closed down.

400
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,118
- Governor Tonyn,
a very vindictive man,

401
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,189
and at the end he had
Turnbull thrown in jail.

402
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,160
He came out on bail and left
the province as a result.

403
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:23,765
But surely, each person is
guilty of arrogance and haughty,

404
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,334
vindictive behavior
it seems to me.

405
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,805
- Despite how Tonyn had treated
his own African slaves,

406
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,908
he now set himself up
as a great liberator

407
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:36,812
by freeing Turnbull's
indentured servants.

408
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,982
Several were too sick to leave,
but with Tonyn's blessing,

409
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,452
about 500 of them
came to St. Augustine

410
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,287
and made their homes there.

411
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,389
Most of them were Menorcan.

412
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,225
- And there they
have been ever since.

413
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,095
From their ranks
have come mayors,

414
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,863
two bishops,

415
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,066
two great literary figures,
Stephen Vincent Benét

416
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,969
and his brother
William Rose Benét.

417
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,240
They've had a very distinguished
and long career in the city.

418
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,910
- But by this time, Tonyn and the
rest of the British colonies

419
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,213
had bigger problems
to contend with.

420
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,570
The American Revolutionary War
had begun.

421
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:20,822
The Boston Tea Party had
taken place in December 1773,

422
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,993
just a few months before
Tonyn arrived in Florida.

423
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,330
For the next year,
as unrest boiled to the North,

424
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,299
Tonyn kept a watchful eye
on his citizenry.

425
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,803
- He was here to keep this colony
safe for king and country.

426
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:39,174
- He was caught in the war almost
within months of his arrival.

427
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,377
But he had such
an aggravating personality

428
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,013
that people of importance
became the enemy,

429
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,515
and as he saw them,

430
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:50,152
they were part of the American
revolutionary mentality.

431
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:55,323
- Both East and West Florida were
the newest of the royal colonies

432
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,126
and had been tightly
controlled by the King

433
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,262
and by Parliament ever since.

434
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:04,566
- Had it been an older colony,
the kinds of grievances

435
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,870
rebels are talking about
in Georgia and South Carolina,

436
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,973
might well have been
in East Florida as well.

437
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,178
But the population that comes in
is settled in so late,

438
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:19,514
most of the people who were
there had very strong,

439
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,450
deep ties to England,

440
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,619
and they had not developed

441
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:30,058
those sort of self-governing
institutional ties.

442
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,194
- Meanwhile, the colony
of West Florida

443
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,095
was dealing with other problems,

444
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,598
as the War of Independence
loomed.

445
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:40,135
It had gone through numerous
governors since it began.

446
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,003
Once of them, John Elliot,

447
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,507
hung himself just a month
after he arrived there.

448
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:49,110
West Florida was hardly
ready for independence.

449
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,079
- I think that East
and West Florida

450
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,547
have been written out of
the historical narrative

451
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:57,152
because they remained loyal
to the British Crown

452
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,154
during the Revolution.

453
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,489
And so they just
don't quite fit in

454
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,961
to that story
of the American patriots.

455
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,197
- And so it was sort of
like phantom pain

456
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,398
from an amputated limb...

457
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,500
Nobody paid attention to it,

458
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,236
and nobody claimed it
for a long time,

459
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,441
and yet it's a politically
important place.

460
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,409
- Much has been written
about the conflicts

461
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,645
fought in the 13 colonies

462
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,514
and the help the rebels
got from the French.

463
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,117
But little is known
about the pivotal role

464
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,653
that battles along the
Mississippi and Gulf Coast

465
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:35,223
played in turning the tide
of the Revolutionary War,

466
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,995
or the vital part Spain had in
supporting the American cause.

467
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,530
- It's just as much a part
of American history

468
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,499
as Washington
crossing the Delaware

469
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,083
or Paul Revere's ride.

470
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,242
- As iconic as the steeple
of the Old North Church,

471
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,313
this unfinished tower on
the Cathedral in Málaga, Spain,

472
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:02,317
stands in silent tribute
to the part it played

473
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,552
in the American
fight for freedom.

474
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,624
- Because the money
the Málaga town council

475
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,327
was to use to finish
this tower was sent

476
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:17,299
instead to help fund the
American War of Independence.

477
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,368
- During the Revolution,
Spain secretly funneled money

478
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,570
to the Americans
through this man,

479
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,707
Bernardo de Gálvez,
a native of Málaga,

480
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,277
who was the Governor
of Spanish-held Louisiana.

481
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,147
Donations came from
all over Spain.

482
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,684
The Cathedral's tower remains
unfinished to this day,

483
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,286
as a lasting tribute
to that effort.

484
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,754
- It's a great story.

485
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,390
Even on the level of the
common man and the common woman,

486
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,560
you're seeing support
for what's going on.

487
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:50,498
- By 1777, Gálvez had sent
an estimated $70,000

488
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,000
worth of medicine, weapons,

489
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,536
and ammunition
to the American rebels.

490
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,341
But in 1779, when Spain
declared war on Great Britain,

491
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,778
Gálvez was free to openly
defend the American cause.

492
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,747
He gathered recruits
from Mexico,

493
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,616
free blacks from Cuba,
Native Americans,

494
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,687
Spanish soldiers, Germans,
and Acadian French.

495
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,023
- Gálvez had a huge army.

496
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,558
Huge.

497
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,761
And it was one that was
multicultural in its makeup,

498
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,496
multi-ethnic.

499
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,767
- And this fleet full of
black sailors and militiamen

500
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,637
who helped win the independence
of the United States of America,

501
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,273
not memorialized, usually.

502
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,110
Except we find them
in the Spanish records.

503
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:38,213
- By 1780, the British
had taken Charleston

504
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:42,050
and blockaded the port cities
along the East Coast.

505
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,352
- The British war effort
in the War of Independence

506
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,588
is entirely based on the sea,

507
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:50,458
and eventually they
capture key port cities

508
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:55,296
basically to control the
economic life of the colonies.

509
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,831
'Cause there's no way
of getting all those goods

510
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:01,136
that you're producing out
into the world trade system.

511
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,072
So what the British are saying,
"We hold Charleston.

512
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,141
If you want to trade,
trade through us."

513
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,543
- Gálvez knew the Mississippi
was a vital route

514
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,146
that circumvented
the British blockade.

515
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,215
He led attacks on the British
forts along the Gulf,

516
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,685
taking Baton Rouge,
Natchez, and Mobile,

517
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,454
but Pensacola

518
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:23,191
was the most formidable
British bastion on the coast.

519
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,428
- Washington makes a statement
that much depends

520
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,229
on what happens in Pensacola,

521
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,166
that he is placing great value
on what is happening

522
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,269
Gálvez's efforts as he moves
towards Pensacola.

523
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,705
- On his way there, Gálvez lost
more than half of his troops

524
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,307
to a hurricane.

525
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,243
Then several of his officers
refused to cross

526
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,847
a shallow channel
to get to shore.

527
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:49,150
- He stood up in the prow
of his ship and stated,

528
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,386
"I alone will take Pensacola."

529
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,789
The rest of the ships followed
after this display of courage,

530
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,826
and the siege
of Pensacola began.

531
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,862
- The Battle of Pensacola
lasted two months,

532
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:05,366
one of the longest conflicts
in the American Revolution.

533
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,137
- And in taking Pensacola,
this was the big prize.

534
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,372
He effectively
shut down anything

535
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,375
that could have happened
from the British front

536
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,611
along the Gulf Coast
of the Mississippi.

537
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,645
He was brilliant.

538
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,585
- The siege of Pensacola
was a decisive battle,

539
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,487
as it made it impossible
for the British

540
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:30,458
to attack from the rear
any of the 13 colonies.

541
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,728
- I think had there not been
the protection from the rear,

542
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,365
that Washington would've had
a much harder uphill climb

543
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,902
in what he was doing
on the Atlantic seaboard.

544
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:44,372
So yes, I think that this was
a pivotal event

545
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,742
in the American fight
for independence.

546
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,812
- The importance of that battle
has not been fully acknowledged

547
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,547
in textbooks.

548
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:55,216
The siege not only kept
the British occupied

549
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,651
on a second front,

550
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,287
but also affected
the number of troops and ships

551
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,522
the British sent

552
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:03,791
just two months
later to Yorktown,

553
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,395
the final battle
in the War of Independence.

554
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,264
- And after the loss of Yorktown,

555
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,900
the British recognize
there's no way back from this.

556
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,269
"We have enough power
to defend the West Indies,

557
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:17,272
the sugar islands,
the Caribbean trade,

558
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,707
or to carry the war on
in America."

559
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,409
And it's a no-brainer.

560
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,380
- Back at that time,
sugar was the oil of the day.

561
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,715
Sugar afforded empire.

562
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:32,287
So the British West Indies
were the most crucial lands

563
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,589
in the British Empire
at this time,

564
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:37,559
so the number-one priority
of the British Empire

565
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,460
during the American Revolution

566
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,530
was not to allow the Revolution
to distract them to the point

567
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,834
that they could lose an island
down in the Caribbean

568
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,436
to the French or the Spanish.

569
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,971
- So they started to move
those people

570
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,641
into positions
outside West Florida,

571
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:59,814
outside the 13 colonies so they
can hold what they still have.

572
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,884
- East Florida became the haven
for thousands of loyalists

573
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,453
leaving the colonies.

574
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,457
- East Florida is designated
as a haven for refugees

575
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,526
from Charleston,

576
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,462
from anywhere
in the American South,

577
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:19,500
and 13,000 to 14,000 refugees
pour in.

578
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,603
- They migrated all over
the province,

579
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:25,506
setting onto estates
that had not yet been developed.

580
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,375
History books
have largely ignored

581
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,011
those thousands of
loyalist families forced

582
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,834
to leave their homes
at the end of the war.

583
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,053
But the recent discovery
of a shipwreck

584
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,656
off the coast of St. Augustine

585
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,625
paints a very human picture

586
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,245
of what those men, women,
and children experienced.

587
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,601
- You see these artifacts
and you can't help

588
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,471
but think about the people
who use these artifacts

589
00:29:56,495 --> 00:30:00,942
and what a turbulent period
in their life this was.

590
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,510
- Chuck Meide is director of

591
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,046
the Lighthouse Archeological
Maritime Program,

592
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,348
also known as LAMP.

593
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,817
Meide and his team
believe this wreck

594
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:15,456
was transporting loyalists
from the fallen 13 colonies.

595
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,492
- Remember, these people
were living

596
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,394
through just perilous times.

597
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,795
War was raging around them.

598
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,597
They were about to
lose their country.

599
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,066
They had fought for king and
country, and now all of a sudden

600
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,335
they have to gather
their families up.

601
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,737
- What happened to these
people on their way

602
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,541
to the one last colony
that was still loyal to England?

603
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,910
- The story is also just
unfolding right beneath us

604
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,846
on the sea floor as we pick
it apart piece by piece.

605
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:45,119
♪♪

606
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,423
- It's a story that would take
these marine biologists

607
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:52,694
all the way to the British
National Archives in Kew.

608
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,830
- I came back from the archives
with more than 1,000 pages...

609
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,032
Correspondence, a list of ships.

610
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,569
So it just paints
a great picture for us

611
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,471
of what was going on.

612
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,374
- It's actually very interesting
because all of these logbooks

613
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,742
make note of the weather.

614
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:11,646
- Dr. Sam Turner is LAMP's
director of archaeology.

615
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,582
- And what that weather
data tells us

616
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,918
is that there was
a nor'easter brewing.

617
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:20,121
- It was New Year's Eve, 1782.

618
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,757
A fleet of 16 British ships

619
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,892
filled with refugees
from Charleston

620
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,395
was sitting off the coast
of St. Augustine

621
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,464
hoping to cross the bar.

622
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,898
They needed to get
into the harbor

623
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,634
before American
privateers attacked.

624
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,970
- Pirates were out there
trying to pick off ships.

625
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,806
And we know the very fleet
that our ship

626
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,610
was a member of was
being chased by privateers.

627
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,780
- Among the hundreds of documents
the pair combed through

628
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:49,016
was a diary of a German soldier
in the British Army.

629
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,019
- He describes his journey
down from Charleston.

630
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,590
He describes themselves
as being flung about pitilessly.

631
00:31:55,614 --> 00:32:00,609
The shipmaster was very nervous
about crossing the bar.

632
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:03,998
- St. Augustine had a reputation

633
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,900
for being
the most dangerous inlet

634
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,170
of all the other British
colonies in North America.

635
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,038
And as they sailed in,
you could see

636
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,774
the wooden remains of shipwrecks

637
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,042
jutting out on either
side of the channel

638
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,613
where ships had been
lost before.

639
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,783
- "The chances of getting across
are terribly slim

640
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,719
and we're all
probably gonna die."

641
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,954
And there's wreckage everywhere.

642
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:31,159
It's all flung up on the beach,
half buried in the sand.

643
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:35,029
It's out on the bar.

644
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,831
- To add to the problem,

645
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,701
the British ships were far
too laden for a shallow inlet.

646
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,805
- When we look at some of these
tonnages, they're extreme.

647
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,173
335.

648
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,008
384.

649
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,676
365.

650
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,144
They are not gonna be able to
get across the bar

651
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,813
at St. Augustine.

652
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,581
- They knew like,

653
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,016
"This isn't the time to
try to get into St. Augustine.

654
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,784
We're gonna wait until
we have a better tide."

655
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,853
- And there's a nor'easter
blowing.

656
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,688
It's a recipe for disaster,
really.

657
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,790
- They are waiting offshore
and the captain

658
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,827
finally dares
to cross the sandbar...

659
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,961
bam!

660
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,696
The ship is run aground.

661
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,566
The surf is pounding
on the ship.

662
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,067
It's coming to pieces.

663
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,870
All of their possessions
are spilling out into the sea.

664
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:19,640
I mean, just within less than
a mile of safe refuge,

665
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,776
their hopes and dreams
are being dashed to pieces,

666
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,635
just like the ship that they
thought was their salvation.

667
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,853
- LAMP's divers have pulled up
a wide array of artifacts

668
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,221
from the storm wreck,

669
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,623
including a flintlock pistol,

670
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,860
two loaded Brown Bess
muskets, six canons,

671
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,630
and the intact ship's bell.

672
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:45,733
But the most remarkable
artifact was one that

673
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,069
instantly transported Meide

674
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:51,539
back to the final moments
of the ship's demise.

675
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:52,940
- The visibility was zero,

676
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,910
as it usually is
offshore St. Augustine,

677
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,613
so we're really in the dark
just feeling this object.

678
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,148
And it was round,
and I could feel a lip to it

679
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,750
and put my hands inside,

680
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,919
and then I realized what it was.

681
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,654
- It was a cooking pot,

682
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,957
which led the archeologists
to a chilling revelation.

683
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,894
- In one of these cooking pots,
one of these iron cauldrons,

684
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,296
we had the remains
of the last meal

685
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,098
that was prepared in that pot.

686
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,800
This is something that has
not seen daylight in,

687
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,203
as it turns out, 228 years.

688
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,804
So that's a pretty
special thing.

689
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,339
I mean, you're the first
person to touch it.

690
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,941
The last person to touch it

691
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,176
did so under very different
circumstances,

692
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,013
probably in those
chaotic moments

693
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,881
in the middle of this tragedy,

694
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:38,052
when the ship was wrecking and
was going to be lost forever.

695
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,788
- A year after the last
of these loyalists

696
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,790
arrived in St. Augustine,

697
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,059
the Revolutionary War was over.

698
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,764
The British period in Florida
had lasted merely 20 years.

699
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,366
- "What shall become of
the thousands of poor loyalist

700
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,235
settlers who are now here

701
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,904
and were just made
comfortable and happy,

702
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,607
astonished by the crops
in the ground?"

703
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,176
- In the short time
the English had been there,

704
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,946
the loyalists had
turned a barren land

705
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,081
into a viable trade area.

706
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,017
But they were about
to lose it all.

707
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,386
As a reward for Spain's
contributions

708
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,221
to the American cause,

709
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:19,060
East and West Florida became
Spanish territory once again.

710
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:22,697
Among those chosen to draft
the Second Treaty of Paris,

711
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:27,101
ending the Revolutionary War,
was Bernardo de Gálvez,

712
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,970
the Spanish hero
who had defeated

713
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,862
British troops
along the Gulf Coast.

714
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,379
And now that the territory
was back in Spanish possession,

715
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,682
many of those survivors
who had fled to Cuba

716
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,151
to escape British rule returned.

717
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,855
Most of them were just children
when they'd left.

718
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,258
- They're sending back certified
copies of deeds to prove

719
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:55,262
that they owned property in
St. Augustine in the 1760s.

720
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,398
- But even though
the British were gone,

721
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:01,002
slavery in the new
United States remained.

722
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,905
Runaway slaves began heading
to Spanish Florida again,

723
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,874
hoping for asylum.

724
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,377
- And Thomas Jefferson
is our Secretary of State,

725
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,113
and he writes to the Spanish
government and says,

726
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,882
"If you still want
to be friends with us,

727
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,219
you will shut down this
sanctuary and this policy."

728
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,754
Spain agrees.

729
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,023
Spain is under a lot
of duress at this point.

730
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,959
Rebellions all over
its wide empire.

731
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:29,397
- So in 1790, Spain reversed
its century-old edict

732
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,166
offering sanctuary
for runaway slaves.

733
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,301
- They have to post announcements
everywhere that

734
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:38,706
"no longer will we receive
and free runaway slaves."

735
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,442
The royal policy was now
officially closed

736
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,045
thanks to Thomas Jefferson.

737
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,347
- But that didn't stop
the animosity

738
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,282
between Spanish-owned Florida

739
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,718
and its American neighbors
to the north.

740
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:54,889
Slaves still ran south,
but this time they sought refuge

741
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:58,859
with Seminole Indians in the
backwoods of Spanish Florida.

742
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,496
- The reason that the people
became known as Black Seminoles

743
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,800
was because they were allies.

744
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,235
- South Georgia
plantation owners later

745
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,972
claimed over $5 million
worth of slave property

746
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,008
was lost during this time.

747
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:17,411
They sent bounty hunters
to get them back.

748
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,815
- And most of the time,
their autonomous communities

749
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,951
were formed in very
inhospitable areas,

750
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:28,889
in swamps, where it was
difficult for the slave catcher

751
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,491
to come and get them again.

752
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,060
- Adding to the tensions
with the United States,

753
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,362
the Spanish began
offering inducements

754
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,031
to move to its colonies.

755
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,367
- You know, no taxes,
fair amount of land.

756
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,903
Originally they wanted people
to convert to Catholicism.

757
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,872
That was a stopping point
for many people

758
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,874
that were Protestant by faith.

759
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,375
But they dropped that provision.

760
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,177
They said, "No, all you have
to do is you have to take

761
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,314
an oath of loyalty to the King,
the Spanish King."

762
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,417
- For those who doubted
the United States would succeed,

763
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,452
it was an attractive offer,

764
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,021
particularly for
British loyalists

765
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,224
who had lost their land
during the war.

766
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,260
- Their business was commerce,
their business was planting,

767
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,129
and they wanted land again.

768
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,132
- The increased revenue that
Florida was enjoying from trade

769
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,135
with Europe
also stirred resentment.

770
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,206
- Florida was trading like
wildfire with Great Britain.

771
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,041
And that angered a lot
of the Georgians.

772
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,377
They were like,
"If you look at the Spanish side

773
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,313
of the St. Marys River,
it's all full of British ships.

774
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,982
And if you look at
our side of the St. Marys River,

775
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,850
there's nobody."

776
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:33,354
- Moreover, Americans worried
that their southern-most border

777
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:35,890
was not well protected.

778
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,124
- The St. Marys River

779
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,193
that divides Georgia and Florida
today,

780
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,295
that was an international
border at the time.

781
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,497
You were in one country
on one side,

782
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,399
a different country
on the other side.

783
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,435
In the late 1700s and 1800s,

784
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,404
you couldn't stop people
from coming in

785
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,873
and out of Florida or Georgia.

786
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:57,044
And sometimes they were coming
to seek revenge on someone

787
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,446
they had a long-standing
grudge against.

788
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,883
So that whole area was almost
like a no man's land.

789
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:08,989
Georgians raided
and Floridians raided back.

790
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,459
- It was a time
of complete lawlessness.

791
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,929
- I think Florida was always
the Wild, Wild West.

792
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,430
I think we could've
taught the West

793
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,599
how to be the Wild, Wild West.

794
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:22,303
- And the beginning of the 19th
century brought more trouble.

795
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:25,272
In 1800, Spain lost Louisiana,

796
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,175
which bordered the Florida
colonies to the West.

797
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,946
It remained a French colony
until Louisiana was purchased

798
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,082
by the United States
three years later.

799
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,285
On the world stage,
the Battle of Trafalgar

800
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,654
destroyed much of Spain's navy.

801
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,924
The Napoleonic Wars
took a devastating toll,

802
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,894
throwing the country
into an era of turbulence.

803
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:51,599
Spain could not send
much aid to its colonies.

804
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,968
The volatile tensions
between the U.S.

805
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,604
and Spanish Florida
came to a head

806
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,540
just before the War of 1812.

807
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,109
As America was preparing
to declare war

808
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,011
over trade restrictions,

809
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,982
they feared that the British,
now allies with Spain,

810
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,251
would stage troops
in St. Augustine.

811
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:13,654
- So we need to seize
these Spanish port towns

812
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:18,259
now before we have the British
navy sailing into them.

813
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,160
- Many Americans felt it was time

814
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,397
to seize the territory
for the United States.

815
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,100
Former Georgia governor
George Mathews

816
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,669
created a private army
and headed to Florida.

817
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:32,006
He called his troops
the Patriots.

818
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,343
In March 1812, this force
of more than 200 men

819
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:41,148
seized the East Florida port
of Fernandina on Amelia Island.

820
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,218
- This insurgent group moves
in and the very next day,

821
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,719
they raise the American flag

822
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,955
and they ask the American Army
and the American Marines

823
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,291
to come take control
of the town,

824
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,392
which they do.

825
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,560
- It was known as
the Patriot War,

826
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,496
and it's one of the most
overlooked events

827
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,165
in early 19th century history.

828
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,100
With Fernandina secured,

829
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,972
the Patriots headed south
to capture St. Augustine.

830
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,708
- So by April, there's actually
an American force

831
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,711
just north of town,
up where Fort Mose used to be.

832
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:15,416
And when they get there,
the Madison government retracts,

833
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,020
quickly, any support
for what they're doing.

834
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:23,057
- News of the Patriots' move
against Spanish Florida

835
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:26,360
took the Madison administration
by surprise.

836
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,330
Military preparations for war
had been focused

837
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,332
on the northern border
with Canada,

838
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,300
not the southern one.

839
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,737
President Madison did not
want to provoke Spain.

840
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,606
He refused to publicly
support the seizure.

841
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,508
- But the U.S. government
does not make a move

842
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,277
to pull the troops out.

843
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:46,080
- The American troops were told
to hold their position,

844
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:50,551
avoid a confrontation,
and defend if attacked.

845
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,286
Inside the Castillo,

846
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,357
Governor Sebastián Kindelán
gave similar orders.

847
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,092
- "Don't attack the Americans.

848
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:01,729
Because if you inflict
an injury on those troops,

849
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:05,766
there will be 10,000 more troops
coming down for vengeance."

850
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,334
- It was a standoff.

851
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,336
Unable to capture St. Augustine,

852
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,706
the Americans tried
to starve out its population.

853
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,775
- American officers were
given the instructions

854
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,543
to kill the cattle.

855
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,313
Because that way, Spanish forces
can't drive them into town

856
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,048
and use them for food.

857
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:24,284
And people said that
for miles around St. Augustine,

858
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:29,523
there was just a stench
of dead, rotting animals,

859
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,325
and that everywhere you went,

860
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:37,765
you saw dead cattle lying on
the banks of the various rivers.

861
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:40,601
- Meanwhile, the Patriots looted
and burned the homes

862
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,958
of anyone sympathetic
to Spanish rule.

863
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,443
- And so the destruction
all around this area

864
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:52,413
was just unbelievable.

865
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,549
- Incensed by the destruction
throughout the area,

866
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,086
the Seminoles and Black
Seminoles took up arms.

867
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,489
They stormed the plantations
occupied by the Georgia Patriots

868
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:03,824
and destroyed them,

869
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,794
liberating hundreds
of plantation slaves

870
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,596
who then joined their ranks.

871
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,700
But the people of St. Augustine
were barely holding on.

872
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,237
- The Governor is actually
counting down the days

873
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,540
to when he will
have no more food

874
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:23,177
and no real chance of survival.

875
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,847
And ironically, what breaks that

876
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:30,217
is a very small contingent
of men from St. Augustine,

877
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,352
all free blacks.

878
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,389
- It was a militia of
about 60 free blacks,

879
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,424
led by a 6' carpenter

880
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,327
and former slave known
as "Big Prince" Whitten.

881
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,730
- Prince Whitten was a slave and
who became kind of a war hero.

882
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,166
- He was the leader
of the free black militia

883
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,768
in the later period.

884
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,338
- He and his family had escaped
from St. Marys, Georgia,

885
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,675
four times before they
successfully made it to Florida.

886
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,444
They had been granted freedom
just two years before

887
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,315
the Spanish stopped giving
sanctuary to runaway slaves.

888
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,650
- But this family takes
on a very important role,

889
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:09,289
including beating the U.S.
Marines in a covert operation.

890
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:14,361
- It's the black militia that
goes out on a raiding party,

891
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,796
realizes that
the American troops

892
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,332
are almost in the same shape.

893
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,167
They're hungry, too.

894
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,636
'Cause they're not getting a lot
of supplies down from Georgia.

895
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,606
- The black militia, along
with a band of Seminoles,

896
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,510
lay in wait at a place
called Twelve Mile Swamp.

897
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:32,880
When American troops send out
a convoy to get supplies,

898
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:35,482
Whitten and his men ambush them.

899
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,518
- And pin them down,
seize the wagons,

900
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,586
and force them
basically to turn back

901
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,422
or to flee for safety
to the St. Johns River.

902
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,191
And the American commander,
when he finds out

903
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:48,228
that that has happened,
retreats.

904
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,465
- It was another victory
for the people of Florida,

905
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:55,402
but it would be the final
victory for Spanish Florida.

906
00:44:55,426 --> 00:45:00,807
The attack at Twelve Mile Swamp
only fueled America's anger.

907
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,211
Newspapers and politicians
in the Southern states

908
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:08,282
called for these Native and
black militias to be punished.

909
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:11,685
- They could not have
blacks with guns

910
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:16,557
and giving hope to
people on plantations

911
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,826
that they too could join them
and get their freedom.

912
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,330
- After Seminoles ambushed
another American supply convoy

913
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,765
a few years later,

914
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,968
General Andrew Jackson
led a retaliatory attack

915
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,704
known as the First Seminole War.

916
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,574
It was 1818.

917
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:37,311
Meanwhile, the entire Spanish
Empire had been collapsing.

918
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,846
Major colonies were
declaring independence

919
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,316
and breaking away from Spain.

920
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,818
- So, you have, during
the Second Spanish Period,

921
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,789
the complete and utter collapse
of the Spanish New World Empire.

922
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:51,458
Argentina has gone its way.

923
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,360
Peru has gone its own way.

924
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,862
Mexico gains its independence.

925
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,465
- No longer a dominant
European power,

926
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,634
Spain could not
keep its territory

927
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:03,470
from constant conflict.

928
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,006
Secretary of State
John Quincy Adams

929
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,743
demanded that Spain either
control its Florida colonies

930
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,312
and their defiance
on the issue of slavery

931
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,449
or cede the territory
to the United States.

932
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,918
- All the trouble that came
from the War of 1812

933
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,354
destabilized the area so much,

934
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,623
I think it made
the acquisition of Florida...

935
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:23,991
The transfer of Florida
to the United States,

936
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,926
I think it made it inevitable.

937
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,428
- In February 1821,

938
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,398
the Adams-Onís Treaty
made Florida

939
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,834
a territory
of the United States.

940
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,770
- When the Spanish gave
up Florida in 1821,

941
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,071
almost immediately the Americans

942
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,741
begin to turn
to the problem of Indians

943
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:42,342
and how to get them out.

944
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,645
The 1820s is a period
of extreme racism

945
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:46,713
against American Indians
in the South.

946
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,616
- The Native population that
had thrived in the region

947
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,351
for 12,000 years

948
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:55,756
before the Europeans arrived
was now nearly extinct.

949
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,759
A small remaining group
of Apalachees

950
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,927
migrated to Louisiana.

951
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,598
The Yamasees, who had long been
believed to be extinct,

952
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:08,935
had scattered throughout Florida
and South Carolina to survive.

953
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,872
- To be Indian in Florida
was dangerous,

954
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:14,541
so they would hide themselves.

955
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,710
- We went back to
our traditional ways

956
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:18,512
of hiding our women and children

957
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,814
because we saw that they valued
the women and children.

958
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,083
- So that's where the swamp
became our friends.

959
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:27,087
But it kept us alive,
and it kept us here today.

960
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,690
- And we'll see moments
in the 19th century

961
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:33,727
as white Americans are trying
to make all Indians extinct,

962
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,128
that they begin to say,

963
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,365
you know, we see here
the last of the Yamasees.

964
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,967
So it leads to this notion
that they are gone,

965
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,036
that they have become
conquered, right?

966
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,472
But they didn't.

967
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,907
- So we became known
as the hidden people

968
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,375
because that's what we did.

969
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,810
We hid mostly
amongst other tribes.

970
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,813
A lot of us have been
identified as Cherokee.

971
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:55,949
Some of us identified
as Seminoles.

972
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,886
- Andrew Jackson was appointed
Governor of the territory.

973
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,757
The U.S. began efforts to
relocate the Seminole Indians,

974
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,959
eventually to
present-day Oklahoma

975
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,062
where other Southeastern
tribes had already gone.

976
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:13,800
- They are removed through
deception, through force,

977
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,535
into Oklahoma,

978
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,672
and then several hundred,
probably 250 or 300 Seminoles,

979
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:22,409
will not go and they will
hide out in the Everglades

980
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,078
and they will stay there
until the early 20th century,

981
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,448
sort of withdrawn
from American society

982
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,117
because they distrust
them so much,

983
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:33,186
and they will create their own
communities in the Everglades.

984
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,555
- And as for the hundreds
of escaped slaves

985
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,491
known as the Black Seminoles,

986
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,626
most of them fled
to the Bahamas.

987
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,530
- Prince Whitten leads
the next exodus in 1821,

988
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:46,867
when the United States
is gonna take Florida.

989
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:49,703
And he leads his
community into exile.

990
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:54,441
- Because the United States
brought their form of slavery

991
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:58,678
and ideas about black people
right down into Florida.

992

of Spanish Florida

994

00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:28,361
there was a place where
different groups came together

1035
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,698
and were able to live
with each other despite,

1036
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:34,100
or because of, their
incredible diversity.

1037
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:37,871
- It wasn't always
easy and peaceful,

1038
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:40,941
but multiculturalism
has been part of the U.S.

1039
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,777
for a long time.

1040
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:46,913
- Will school kids
in Boston and Virginia

1041
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,748
learn about the Spanish

1042
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,352
who were here before the other
Founding Fathers we know of?

1043
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:55,355
I don't know.
That remains to be seen.

1044
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:58,725
- I would like the rest
of the United States

1045
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,227
to accept it as part
of the history,

1046
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,997
as a part of the credible,
believable history,

1047
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,832
that it belongs in the history.

1048
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:10,804
It's not an anomaly like,
"Oh, that's Spanish."

1049
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:14,374
- As the very base of it,
it's a pretty good story.

1050
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:17,644
It has all these great
implications for, wow,

1051
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,980
this is a history that we've
forgotten or under-appreciated,

1052
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:25,085
but, man, at the foundation
of it, it's just a great story.

1053
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,988
- It's good to have a narrative
of persistence, you know?

1054
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:29,889
We will survive.

1055
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,691
We will be strong.

1056
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,893
We will have problems.

1057
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,830
We may even have our towns
burned down from time to time,

1058
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,332
but we will rebuild
and we will carry on.

1059
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,435
That's a powerful story
for any country to have.

1060
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,404
It's a powerful narrative.

1061
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:52,428
