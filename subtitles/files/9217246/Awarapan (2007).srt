1
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:49,259
Hey baby, my place upstairs later.

2
00:00:58,852 --> 00:00:59,894
What's up?

3
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,230
Yeah!

4
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:03,565
Okay, later baby.

5
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,317
Okay l am going to check out the
consignment myself right now.

6
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,397
Separate the live ones
from the dead ones.

7
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,736
Jimmy.

8
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,405
Yeah it's me.

9
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,868
l asked you for 30 girls and you sent
me 17, and half of them are even dead.

10
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,204
This is not how l do business!

11
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,791
l already sold them to
our friends in Romania.

12
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,752
l tell you what, l can't
even unload these girls..

13
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,879
..not even to my new customers.

14
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,381
So this is what you are going to do!

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,925
You send me 30 girls, and good ones!

16
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,053
When l say good, l mean
fresh clean ones.

17
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,223
l got a reputation and l am not going
to let you mess with my business!

18
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,850
lf you can't do this work..

19
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,476
..l am going to call someone who can.

20
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:25,896
Listen Jimmy if l have to..
l will call the Russians!

21
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,148
They might cost me more..

22
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,358
..but atleast they will give
me a decent consignment!

23
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,319
We sure go back, but not
so far back that..

24
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,825
She is still alive!

25
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,160
Hey! Hey you stop!

26
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,329
Hey, where are you going?

27
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,123
Hold it man! Stop!

28
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,249
Hold it! Hold it.
- Stop.

29
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,375
Stop! - Hey stop!

30
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,963
She is getting away!

31
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,923
Hey hold it!

32
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,175
Where do you think you are going?

33
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,221
Stop!

34
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,348
There! There! There!

35
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:02,975
She is over there!

36
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,101
Halt! Hold it!

37
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,152
Surprise!

38
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,990
No!

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,283
You are fast.

40
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,872
Let me go!

41
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,165
No, leave me!

42
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,291
l want to be free!

43
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,417
Leave me!

44
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,252
No!

45
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,923
No, please leave me!

46
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,968
No!

47
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,350
Shivam, come on.

48
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,061
There is a problem.

49
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,147
Room number 203.

50
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,922
The room is booked in
the name of Ronnie..

51
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,382
..maybe that's why no one stopped him.

52
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:48,099
Hey Shivam, good that you arrived.

53
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,103
Take care of this, take
care of this shit.

54
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,318
Hey, listen.. this is not my fault.

55
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,113
Ask him.

56
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,364
Tell him!

57
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,408
She was talking very frankly
sitting here..

58
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,451
..but l don't know what happened
to her on the bed.

59
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,038
She started to abuse me she
scratched me like a cat!

60
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,331
Look! Here!

61
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,543
That's why l killed her.

62
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,587
Take care of her.

63
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,256
Tell Malik uncle, it's my fault.

64
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,632
l was drunk..

65
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:27,138
Shivam, please.

66
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:42,195
You scoundrel, who are you calling?

67
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:43,405
Are you calling the police?

68
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,157
Keep the phone down!

69
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,366
Keep the phone down!

70
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,534
Ask him to keep the phone down!

71
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,995
Look, l have 4 more bullets,
l will shoot you with two..

72
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,706
..and two on him, understood!

73
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,168
Shivam no!

74
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:57,419
No Shivam!

75
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:04,176
No!

76
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,385
Leave him Shivam!

77
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,511
Shivam, listen to me!

78
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,180
Hey move!

79
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,220
Shivam, enough Shivam!

80
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,346
Enough Shivam!

81
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:50,472
Leave him!

82
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:51,640
Have you gone mad!

83
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,144
Why are you doing this Shivam!
Leave him Shivam!

84
00:07:58,438 --> 00:07:59,481
Shivam!

85
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,066
And in local news, the Hong
Kong police department..

86
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,777
..have arrested Manoj Malik,
a.k.a. Munna..

87
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:07,239
..for the suspected murder
of Sylvia Thomas.

88
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:10,158
A hotel employee of Hong
Kong lnternational.

89
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,121
Manoj is the only son of
the local business man,,

90
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:17,124
..Mr. Rajan Malik and nephew
of Bharat Malik..

91
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:20,252
..the owner of Hong Kong
lnternational hotels.

92
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:23,130
The Malik family moved to Hong
Kong about 12 years ago..

93
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:26,133
..from lndia. lt is believed that
the Malik's were involved..

94
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:29,636
..in various illegitimate
business and activities.

95
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:33,140
lf you want to know the
stature of a person..

96
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:36,810
..then you should find
out about his enemies.

97
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:41,606
The more dangerous his enemies are..

98
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:46,486
..the higher his stature is.

99
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:51,324
You are progressing nicely.

100
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,543
Will you have food?

101
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:08,175
The auditors were saying,
that your single hotel..

102
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:11,803
..does seven times more business
than all our other hotels.

103
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:16,183
Whereas we have casinos
in our hotels..

104
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,519
..and call dancers from all over
the world and make them perform.

105
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,357
But even then, your
hotel is number one.

106
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:30,197
lt is true, when you can
progress the right way..

107
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:36,244
..then you shouldn't think
of using illegal means.

108
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,414
Sorry sir, you can't go.
- Don't touch me!

109
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,383
What was the need?

110
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,593
You didn't do the right thing
by getting Munna arrested!

111
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:58,308
Dad, whenever l try to do business
with Rajan uncle, this Shivam..

112
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:02,229
Don't interfere in my business
relationships..

113
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,356
..you are just a servant,
behave like one!

114
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:05,816
Or else..
- Or else what?

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,405
What?

116
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:14,533
Do you understand business?

117
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,413
You had booked the room in the
hotel in your name for Munna.

118
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,751
Papa, listen..

119
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,425
The hotel is Shivam's.

120
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:34,803
The business is Shivam's too.

121
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,390
You will not go to that
hotel behind my back..

122
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:42,769
..and neither will you talk
to Shivam in a high tone.

123
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:44,938
Understood.

124
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:48,358
Understood!
- Yes.

125
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:04,291
The condition of the grieved
cannot be narrated..

126
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:10,839
..whose tears are concealed
in his heart forever.

127
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,397
l never saw you drinking like this.

128
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:29,775
Are you fine?

129
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:38,784
Come, l will take you inside.

130
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:39,910
Come.

131
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:43,955
Come on.
- l want to talk to you.

132
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:45,499
Yes.

133
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,420
A girl, Reema.

134
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:55,425
She is a Pakistani.

135
00:11:56,843 --> 00:12:00,347
She is no ordinary girl, that's
why l have kept her secluded..

136
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,599
..from everyone's eyes.

137
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:06,478
A few days ago l had gone to meet her.

138
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:11,066
l talked to her a lot, l
gave her a lot of love.

139
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:16,613
But when she was in bed with me..

140
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:27,833
..for the first time l realised..
l have her body..

141
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:33,463
..but her heart is far away from me.

142
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,344
lf this girl starts meeting
someone else..

143
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:41,805
..or if she falls in love
with someone else..

144
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,767
..then l won't survive Shivam.

145
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:51,815
l am going to London for 2 weeks.

146
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:59,364
This is her address, keep a watch
on her, follow this girl..

147
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:05,370
..and find out, if l am the
only one in her life..

148
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:10,000
..or is there someone else too.

149
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:14,004
This better be my illusion,..

150
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:21,970
..but
if it is true, then call me

151
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,574
Good bye.

152
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,954
Goodbye.
- Bye.

153
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:29,931
Yes.

154
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,643
Malik sir has sent me.

155
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,687
Can you speak a little louder, please?

156
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,191
Malik sir has sent this
parcel for you.

157
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:15,727
Oh hi.

158
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,106
No l cannot come now.

159
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:24,069
No, it will take me some more time.

160
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:27,239
Yes, l will be ready.

161
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:29,450
Just a minute, will
you hold on please.

162
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:31,535
Excuse me.

163
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,413
Yes.
- You can leave.

164
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:37,249
Malik sir has sent the car for you.

165
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,294
No, l will not need the car.

166
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:43,547
l will talk to Malik sir myself.
- Okay.

167
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:48,260
This is my card..
- No, no l won't need that too.

168
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:51,472
Okay.

169
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:55,684
Listen.. okay give me your card.

170
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:00,606
Who knows when l might need it?

171
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:04,568
Good bye.

172
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:06,320
Good bye.

173
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:19,166
You are a strange man,
you are not leaving..

174
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:23,712
..even after saying goodbye.
- Good bye.

175
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,593
l am sorry.

176
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:33,556
Let it be..
- l am sorry.

177
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:34,682
l will do it.

178
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:37,351
Let it be.

179
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:52,366
What is this?
- l am so sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

180
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:53,534
l have been waiting for so long.

181
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:54,702
Enough now.

182
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:55,828
Shall we go?

183
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:19,226
# Somewhere out there, l
know there is someone.. #

184
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:23,397
# ..out there, who is waiting
for me beloved. #

185
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:27,276
# He is going to set me free, beloved. #

186
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:35,534
# Who is just love for me in his eyes,
there is someone, beloved. #

187
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,829
# l am waiting for him, beloved. #

188
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:43,250
# Someone who is missing
only me in his life.. #

189
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:47,546
# ..who is restless for me, l
am waiting for him, beloved. #

190
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,674
# He would love only me. #

191
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:56,263
# Everything related to him
is connected with me.. #

192
00:18:56,347 --> 00:19:03,395
# ..who would love me eternally, who is
more loyal than loyalty, beloved. #

193
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,367
# How long must l keep
dreaming of a fantasy? #

194
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:19,912
# Why can't he be a part
of my reality? #

195
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,379
# l think only about him in my dreams. #

196
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:31,715
# The one that will have
all the vibrant colours. #

197
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:38,472
# The one that l always thought about,
he must be somewhere, beloved.. #

198
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:42,935
# ..my sweet heart, my beloved. #

199
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:47,314
# Somewhere out there, l
know there is someone.. #

200
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:50,484
# ..out there, who is waiting
for me, beloved. #

201
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:54,071
# He is going to set me free, beloved.. #

202
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,534
Kabir l am messaging
you some numbers..

203
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:02,580
..find out whom they belong to,
and monitor them 24 hours.

204
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:06,458
l have a lot of work to do. ls it so
necessary to find the numbers?

205
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,836
Will you do the work without
asking any question?

206
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:10,588
Okay. - Please.

207
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:15,426
# l know that he is going
to be my destiny. #

208
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,971
# lt's all a part of
cupid's conspiracy. #

209
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:30,774
# l am waiting for him to arrive
l will hide him in my heart. #

210
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,444
# The one that my heart
has said yes to. #

211
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:37,531
# l will find that companion,
my sweet heart, beloved. #

212
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,910
# l have trust, beloved.. #

213
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:45,664
# Somewhere out there, l
know there is someone.. #

214
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,460
# ..out there, who is waiting
just for me beloved. #

215
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:52,630
# He is going to set
me free, beloved.. #

216
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:57,343
# Someone who is missing
only me in his life.. #

217
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:01,055
# ..who is restless for me, l
am waiting for him, beloved. #

218
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:04,475
# He would love only me. #

219
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:12,358
# Everything related to him
is connected with me.. #

220
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:18,531
# ..who would love me eternally, who is
more loyal than loyalty, beloved. #

221
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,530
Bye.
- Bye, good night.

222
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:00,656
Good night.

223
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:02,992
Bye.

224
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,571
Hello. - Guess whose back?
Back again, Shady is back.

225
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:41,906
Back again.
- Hello.

226
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:44,700
Guess whose back? Guess whose
back?

227
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:46,744
Who is this? - Guess whose back?

228
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:55,669
Hello, l am back!

229
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:57,588
And so is my friend Johnny!

230
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,549
Stop! Stop! Stop!

231
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:03,636
You will send me to jail!
You will send me to jail!

232
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,970
You will send me to jail!

233
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:16,815
You will send me to jail!

234
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:17,942
You scoundrel!

235
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:25,866
You scoundrel, l am going to kill you!

236
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,034
Listen.

237
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:38,587
Munna's bodyguard took the
blame for Sylvia's murder.

238
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:40,506
Since he has come out of the jail..

239
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,007
..he has made my life hell.

240
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,012
Always keeps calling me.

241
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:48,681
Where is Shivam, where is Shivam.

242
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:50,099
l tried to explain uncle..

243
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:51,851
..it is a very small matter,
let it go.

244
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,018
He doesn't understand.

245
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:54,687
After all, we have not committed..

246
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:55,813
..the rape and the murder.

247
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:57,523
But no, that scoundrel Shivam..

248
00:23:57,606 --> 00:23:59,191
..that rascal Shivam!

249
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:05,698
Look, listen to me, call up
uncle and apologise to him.

250
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,658
There is no point in stretching
the matter.

251
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:09,994
Listen to me.

252
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,164
Son of a..

253
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:17,626
Here talk to him, make him understand.

254
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:18,961
Make him understand.

255
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:25,676
Shivam!

256
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,761
Say whatever you want to.

257
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,097
But not like a coward on the phone..

258
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:31,265
..say it on my face.

259
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,063
l made him understand.

260
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:39,982
What did you do?

261
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:42,776
Shivam! Shivam listen to me.

262
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:45,696
What do you think of yourself?

263
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:48,115
You can shoot and abuse
whoever you want!

264
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,283
What are you?

265
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:52,578
Your stature and your pride..

266
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:57,208
..that's all because my
father is supporting you.

267
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:02,171
Once he stops supporting you then
see what happens with you.

268
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:05,341
Did you hear!

269
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:10,638
The day Malik sir stops
supporting you..

270
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,181
..that day, your corpse will
be lying in this sewer!

271
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,646
Rajan Munna, are they your family?

272
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,483
Ronnie, they are just using you..

273
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:25,153
..so that one day they can just take
over your father's business..

274
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:27,321
..and ruin you!

275
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,367
lf possible, try to understand it.

276
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:00,563
Good bye.

277
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:18,289
Yes sir.
- Where are you?

278
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:21,376
At home, anything special?

279
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:28,216
Tell me Shivam, is there
loyalty or betrayal..

280
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:32,637
..in Bharat Malik's fate.

281
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:38,267
Don't worry sir, there is still
nothing like you had thought.

282
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:42,480
Okay.

283
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:49,445
Okay, atleast today l can sleep
without having to drink.

284
00:26:50,738 --> 00:26:53,366
But still keep a watch on this girl.

285
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:58,246
The heart of a woman and
the depth of an ocean..

286
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:00,415
..are never easy to measure Shivam.

287
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:06,295
Such loneliness, such helplessness..

288
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,424
..why does love give you so much pain.

289
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,804
Good that you keep far
away from all this.

290
00:27:16,347 --> 00:27:17,473
Good night.

291
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:54,469
What a day friend, today we
have hit double jackpot.

292
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:57,680
You are right Kabir, today
we have hit the jackpot!

293
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,767
Faster! Come on drive faster!

294
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,602
lt doesn't go any faster.

295
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,397
We have found a nice party.

296
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,523
Yes.

297
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,485
What happened?

298
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:11,819
What happened?

299
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:14,489
What timing!

300
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:21,537
This has to happen now.

301
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:24,624
Come on hurry up.

302
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:25,750
Yes take the tyre out.

303
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:27,710
Shivam, get aside.

304
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:32,840
We are done for, Shivam
get out of here.

305
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:33,966
They don't recognise me..

306
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,426
..if they see you it will
be a big problem.

307
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:36,636
Go from here.

308
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,429
You go, l will do it. Come on go.

309
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:05,999
You are looking very scared, sir.

310
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,340
No matter, release these birds..

311
00:29:14,424 --> 00:29:16,467
..Allah will shower his grace on you.

312
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:20,346
What?
- Only for 20 rupees sir..

313
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,765
..one bird is for 20 rupees.

314
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:26,352
Set them free, and then wish
for whatever you want..

315
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:28,438
..Allah will surely fulfil your wish.

316
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:30,523
You will not get a better
chance than this.

317
00:29:32,442 --> 00:29:34,444
Take the blessing of
the devotees of Allah

318
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:36,362
Neither do l need your birds..

319
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:38,614
..nor the grace of your Allah,
now go from here!

320
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:44,579
Are you an atheist, sir?
- Yes.

321
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:48,541
That's a very big sin.

322
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,628
Come on.

323
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:55,923
You don't believe in Allah at all?

324
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,971
This is a strange way
to run your business.

325
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:05,391
First cage the birds then set
them free taking money..

326
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:07,393
..and then say that if you
will set them free..

327
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:10,104
..then Allah will shower
his grace on you.

328
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:14,817
Great, first commit the sin and
then teach us about good deeds.

329
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:17,403
Look sir, l have not
committed any sin..

330
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:19,947
..these birds belong to someone else.

331
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:22,533
l just bring them to the
market and sell them.

332
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:24,911
Then why don't you just sell them..

333
00:30:25,787 --> 00:30:28,081
What is the need to talk
about sin and grace?

334
00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:31,417
There is a need, do you
know 1400 years ago..

335
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:34,420
..the Prophet Mohammad,
he would buy the slaves..

336
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:36,798
..of the Mecca and the
Madina at any price.

337
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:38,841
And then he would set them free.

338
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:40,551
There are no more slaves now.

339
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:43,429
That's why l sell these birds,
so that people buy them..

340
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:45,807
..and set them free in
the greed of grace.

341
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:51,145
There are such fools too.
- Again nonsense.

342
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:54,440
lf you don't believe me,
then free these birds..

343
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:56,442
..and when Allah will shower
his grace on you..

344
00:30:56,526 --> 00:30:58,444
..and your soul will find peace..

345
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:00,571
..then you will start believing it.

346
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:07,078
Shivam what are you doing here?

347
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:09,872
Come on, let us go from here.

348
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,708
Come on.

349
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:15,461
l searched the entire market
for you, you know that..

350
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:16,629
..and you are sitting here.

351
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:18,131
The party is waiting for us.

352
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:21,467
lt is a question of 30 lakhs,
where is your concentration..

353
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:23,970
..l am not talking nonsense.

354
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:27,932
Yes, how are you?

355
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:30,101
We have picked up the goods, yes.

356
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,644
lt is in the trunk.

357
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:33,980
Yes, we are reaching, we are reaching.

358
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:38,943
What a party we have found.

359
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:42,488
Let us quickly hand over
the fatso to him..

360
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:44,615
..and then the 30 lakh is ours.

361
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,997
Just think that the
entire world is ours.

362
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:53,499
'There is a need, do you
know 1400 years ago..

363
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,501
..the Prophet Mohammad,
he would buy the slaves..

364
00:31:55,585 --> 00:31:58,129
..of the Mecca and the
Madina at any price.'

365
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:00,048
'And then he would set them free.'

366
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:04,010
'There are no more slaves now.'

367
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:06,512
'That's why l sell these birds,
so that people buy them..

368
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:09,640
..and set them free in the
greed of Allah's grace.'

369
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:13,895
'Again nonsense.'

370
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,522
'lf you don't believe me,
then free these birds..

371
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:18,566
..and when Allah will shower
his grace on you..

372
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:20,568
..and your soul will find peace..

373
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,695
..then you will start believing it.'

374
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,157
With great style, isn't it Shivam?

375
00:32:31,913 --> 00:32:35,041
What happened, why did
you stop the car?

376
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,709
Shivam.

377
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:46,094
What are you doing.

378
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,763
Don't.. don't kill me.

379
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,684
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

380
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:54,227
Don't..
- Quiet, get lost fatso.

381
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,688
l spared your life.
- Don't kill me!

382
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:57,814
l will not kill you.

383
00:32:57,939 --> 00:33:00,191
What are you doing Shivam?
- Nothing, listen to me.

384
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,734
Fatso, come back and sit inside.

385
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:04,612
Go, go.
- l can give my life for you..

386
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,656
..but he is worth 30 lakhs!

387
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:08,700
Go, go from here fatso.

388
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:10,660
You are God for me, you
have saved my life.

389
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:11,786
Come on fatso, sit inside!

390
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:12,912
Thank you so much.

391
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,664
The fatso is not listening.

392
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,917
Where are you going, stop!

393
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:19,168
Stop!

394
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:23,297
Shivam, what are you doing?

395
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:25,091
What has happened to you?

396
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:27,135
You will die, and kill me too.

397
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:28,720
What has happened to you today?

398
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:32,765
Let it be, you will not understand.

399
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,101
You have gone mad, mad.

400
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:41,149
l am saved.

401
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:48,781

00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,023
You had said that l call
you if l want something.

443
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:18,152
l didn't want to trouble you,
but something important..

444
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:19,278
..has come up.

445
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:20,405
lt is just a question of 2-3 hours.

446
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:23,449
How long?
- ln half an hour.

447
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:39,048
Hello. Don't hit me, don't hit me.

448
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:40,466
Didn't you recognise me?

449
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:43,177
Me, didn't you recognise me?
- No.

450
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,054
Try to remember, we had met.

451

Try to remember,

452
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,308
Remember you had spared my life.

453
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:50,435
No, l don't remember.

454
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,103
Sood, Siddharth Sood.

455
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:53,980
l was having food in my hotel
and you kidnapped me..

456
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:56,107
..in Jodhpur, remember.

457
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:59,152
Do you remember?
- Yes.

458
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:03,114
You changed my life by sparing me.

459
00:40:03,323 --> 00:40:04,615
Now l am the CEO of God.

460
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:08,077
l show the right path to the
one that have strayed.

461
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:10,997
Here, here l live in the monastery..

462
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,124
..outside of Hong Kong.

463
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,375
Do come and visit me someday.

464
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:15,501
Okay, l will come.

465
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,128
Do come.

466
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,673
Hello, excuse me.
- You..

467
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,133
You are so strange Shivam..

468
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:24,010
..l have been waiting
for you for so long..

469
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:25,636
..and you are standing
there talking to him.

470
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,474
l am sorry, l am sorry.

471
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:32,226
You had to wait for him because of me.

472
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:33,436
Because of me.

473
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:34,562
Please excuse me.

474
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:35,688
l don't know why we monks feel that..

475
00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:37,440
..just because we have
renounced the world..

476
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:38,566
Everyone else has too.

477
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:41,152
l am very happy to meet you.

478
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:43,279
Very happy.
- Okay.

479
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,531
Do come and meet me.

480
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:47,450
Sorry.

481
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,750
Okay tell me, what do you do?

482
00:40:58,419 --> 00:40:59,545
l am in charge of Malik sir's hotel.

483
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:03,299
l had given you my card.

484
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:07,053
Yes. By the way he was saying that..

485
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:10,390
..you are a very dangerous person.

486
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:15,311
l mean.. you get angry soon.

487
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,486
You had said that you have some
important work with me.

488
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:29,075
Actually.. since Malik sir
has left for London..

489
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:32,161
..l sense a strange fear.

490
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:39,419
And you won't believe but..

491
00:41:42,797 --> 00:41:44,382
l feel that there is
a ghost in my house.

492
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,350
The ghost is in your mind
and not in your house.

493
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:57,478
And that's your loneliness.

494
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:03,401
Even l used to run and be
afraid of my loneliness.

495
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:09,115
Then one day l befriended
that loneliness..

496
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:11,242
..and everything was fine again.

497
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:18,666
lf you take my advice, then
befriend your loneliness..

498
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:23,841
Okay, if you say so then l will
try to befriend my loneliness.

499
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,759
But that will take sometime..

500
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:30,097
..right now, there is another way.
- What's that?

501
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,901
That.. l had made a talisman for me..

502
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:45,404
..from a priest here.

503
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:47,865
lt might be ready by now.

504
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:51,243
l will tie it to my door.

505
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,289
l will have faith that
Allah is with me..

506
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:58,333
..he is protecting me.

507
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,712
Please, will you go in..

508
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:03,714
..and bring that talisman
from the priest.

509
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,178
l cannot go in.

510
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:15,726
Temples, mosques and other
places of worship..

511
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,020
..l don't like them..

512
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:21,273
..its better that you keep
me away from all this.

513
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,736
l am sorry but, it is forbidden
for women to go inside..

514
00:43:26,278 --> 00:43:28,739
..and l need that talisman.

515
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:34,119
Please l request you, please go
in and bring that talisman.

516
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:47,966
Yes.
- Tell me.

517
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:51,970
Ms. Reema has sent me.

518
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:55,474
The priest is conducting
the prayer, take a seat.

519
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,477
As soon as he finishes praying
you can meet him. - Okay.

520
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:27,005
Aliyah, you take so much time.
- Shivam.

521
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:28,131
Come here.
- No Shivam.

522
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:29,842
What?
- Leave me Shivam.

523
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,803
The prayers are only for 10 minutes..

524
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:35,055
..and you don't concentrate
for that long too.

525
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:36,181
That's the limit.

526
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,393
How did you stay in your mother's
womb for nine months?

527
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,520
There is something called as patience.

528
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,940
When you pray l feel very lonely.

529
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:47,067
What happens to you?

530
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:49,069
You cut off yourself from me.

531
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:52,030
l cannot tolerate this distance.

532
00:44:52,573 --> 00:44:54,825
And today you were praying
for a really long time..

533
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:56,034
..to your Allah.

534
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:59,079
You were not ready to get up.

535
00:44:59,413 --> 00:45:01,832
Today l was talking about
something special..

536
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:02,958
..about you.

537
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,376
You were complaining
about me to Allah.

538
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:07,546
l wasn't complaining,
l was praying for you.

539
00:45:08,422 --> 00:45:10,841
l was telling Allah
to make you believe..

540
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:14,261
..to make you a believer
from an atheist.

541
00:45:14,928 --> 00:45:16,847
No matter in what form and
way you believe in him..

542
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,600
..but do believe in him.

543
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:23,854
Are you listening Shivam?
- Yes, l am listening.

544
00:45:25,063 --> 00:45:27,858
That's the problem with you people..

545
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:30,903
..except for God you understand
everything else.

546
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,449
When there is no God, then what
is there to understand?

547
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,161
lt is difficult to talk to you.

548
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:43,624
l want us to be together even
after we are dead, in heaven.

549
00:45:44,082 --> 00:45:45,834
And only those people stay
together in heaven..

550
00:45:45,918 --> 00:45:46,960
..who believe in God.

551
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:49,213
Otherwise you will be somewhere else..

552
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:50,464
..and l will be somewhere else.

553
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:53,592
l will have to live
without you Shivam.

554
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:00,849
Aliyah, all l know that the
love that l have for you..

555
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:04,061
..that's my only desire,
and my only religion.

556
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:07,606
For me, you are my God and my faith.

557
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,486
Oh God, Shivam that's enough.

558
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:15,864
And about God, if he really
exists and if he..

559
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:17,950
..has united you with me.

560
00:46:19,368 --> 00:46:22,496
Then one day he will
make me his devotee.

561
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:23,956
When he does it, how he does it..

562
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:25,249
..l have left that to him.

563
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:26,875
But Shivam, listen to..
- Enough about the Lord..

564
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:30,087
..come let us talk about
something else.

565
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,465
Let us talk about love.
- Shivam.

566
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:35,384
Let us talk about me, about you.
- Leave me Shivam.

567
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:37,219
Aliyah.
- Leave me.

568
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:38,637
Listen to me.

569
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:42,057
Where will you go now?

570
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,183
Where will you run now?

571
00:47:12,004 --> 00:47:14,923
You have crossed all the
limits of shamelessness.

572
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,925
You are openly flirting
with your lover..

573
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:18,385
..in front of everyone!

574
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:21,346
Fearless, you dare to face me too!

575
00:47:21,597 --> 00:47:23,682
Lower your eyes, ill-mannered!

576
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:31,273
l love your daughter.

577
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:33,942
l want to marry her.

578
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:37,946
lf you agree, and even
if you don't agree.

579
00:47:38,363 --> 00:47:39,490
Don't you dare touch me!

580
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:41,533
First of all you are from
a different religion..

581
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:43,702
..and you are a criminal too.

582
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:47,414
Didn't he tell you, what
his profession is?

583
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:50,709
He is a thief! He is a goon!

584
00:47:51,043 --> 00:47:53,962
And because of these crimes,
he has been jailed twice..

585
00:47:54,046 --> 00:47:55,964
..he has been jailed twice!

586
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:58,217
You will marry my daughter!

587
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:01,970
Will you use your illegal
means to feed her!

588
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:21,990
lf you will allow me to
marry your daughter..

589
00:48:22,074 --> 00:48:25,994
..then this weapon,
this life of crime..

590
00:48:26,078 --> 00:48:30,749
..l am prepared to leave everything.

591
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:55,023
Forget about this weapon
and this life of crime..

592
00:48:55,107 --> 00:49:00,070
..you are going to die right now!

593
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,815
Aliyah!

594
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,359
Nothing will happen to you.
- Shivam.

595
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:40,486
Shivam.

596
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:43,071
Aliyah! Aliyah!

597
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,364
Your talisman.

598
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:36,166
lf you don't mind, then can
l say something to you?

599
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:37,835
Tell me.

600
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:43,173
l don't know, but l feel
that l have never seen..

601
00:50:43,215 --> 00:50:47,261
..anyone more alone
and lonely than you.

602
00:50:48,887 --> 00:50:52,808
Maybe you are still surrounded
by that loneliness.

603
00:50:59,815 --> 00:51:02,234
You need this talisman more than me.

604
00:51:55,245 --> 00:52:02,503
# So come again and trouble me. #

605
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:11,803
# So come again and make me cry. #

606
00:52:31,907 --> 00:52:38,997
# My heart was filled with sorrows. #

607
00:52:40,582 --> 00:52:47,965
# My eyes started crying. #

608
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:56,974
# l gasped so heavily. #

609
00:52:58,892 --> 00:53:06,650
# Like the wind blows. #

610
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:15,075
# So come again and trouble me. #

611
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:24,042
# So come again and make me cry. #

612
00:53:25,043 --> 00:53:31,633
# Come back, come back, come back. #

613
00:53:31,717 --> 00:53:41,518
# Come back, come back,
come back, come back. #

614
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:05,334
You have to come back. Aliya!

615
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:53,674
# Take back all your sorrows. #

616
00:54:54,967 --> 00:55:01,890
# All those that you have given me. #

617
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:10,899
# Take back all your sorrows. #

618
00:55:13,402 --> 00:55:20,409
# All those that you have given me. #

619
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:29,543
# Or else tell me,.. #

620
00:55:31,086 --> 00:55:39,178
# ..how will l tolerate them. #

621
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:47,060
# So come again and trouble me. #

622
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:56,069
# So come again and make me cry. #

623
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:04,119
# Come back, come back, come back. #

624
00:56:04,203 --> 00:56:13,921
# Come back, come back,
come back, come back. #

625
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:11,186
Your car is standing in
the middle of the road.

626
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:17,025
Shivam, what happened?

627
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,781
Shall we go.

628
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:34,543
..l am too sexy, Ayesha,
Ayesha, Ayesha.

629
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:44,219
Shivam.

630
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,642
They have come to talk peace, relax.

631
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:53,604
Munna please, not now.

632
00:57:53,645 --> 00:57:56,815
Not now, Ronnie. Listen to me.

633
00:57:56,899 --> 00:57:58,192
Munna later, please listen to me.

634
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,319
Sit. Please sit down.

635
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,493
Sit.

636
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:19,839
By profession.. l am a business man.

637
00:58:21,257 --> 00:58:23,134
My business is not killing people.

638
00:58:24,427 --> 00:58:26,137
But if someone interferes
in my business..

639
00:58:26,178 --> 00:58:28,556
..then l kill him.

640
00:58:31,142 --> 00:58:33,269
You are interfering in my business.

641
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,855
ln my business too.

642
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,606
Along with my son.

643
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:48,617
But l will forgive you, because
you are a slave of my brother.

644
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:56,709
But for that you will have
to apologise to me.

645
00:59:06,218 --> 00:59:09,555
Touch my feet, apologise.

646
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:35,581
What are you doing?

647
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:36,707
Hey don't shoot.

648
00:59:36,791 --> 00:59:37,875
Hey, hey.

649
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:39,210
What are you doing?

650
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:40,378
What are you doing?

651
00:59:40,419 --> 00:59:41,712
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

652
00:59:41,754 --> 00:59:43,255
Shivam! Shivam!

653
00:59:44,256 --> 00:59:45,883
Shivam, do you know
what you are doing?

654
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:49,553
What had l said to you, never
come back here again!

655
00:59:49,637 --> 00:59:52,306
Never come back here again!

656
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,225
Did you understand!

657
00:59:54,266 --> 00:59:55,351
Lower the guns!

658
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:56,560
Lower the guns.

659
00:59:57,436 --> 00:59:58,521
Relax.

660
00:59:58,604 --> 00:59:59,939
Shivam, Shivam, Shivam relax.

661
01:00:03,776 --> 01:00:05,236
l am not that easy a target,
that you can kill me..

662
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:07,947
..whenever you want to!

663
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:11,242
You had come to talk about peace..

664
01:00:11,283 --> 01:00:12,368
..then listen to me carefully.

665
01:00:12,868 --> 01:00:16,956
Never again try to interfere
in my matters again!

666
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:24,296
l will give you and
your men two minutes.

667
01:00:26,674 --> 01:00:27,967
You will regret it.

668
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:51,657
Give me a drink.

669
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:59,290
Enjoy your drink sir.

670
01:01:01,709 --> 01:01:03,586
Rajan is Malik sir's brother.

671
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:07,298
l am not asking you to touch
his feet and apologise..

672
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:09,008
..l am your friend.

673
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:11,552
l worry for you.

674
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:19,310
But l don't know why, you
have again become what..

675
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,876
Bye.

676
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:46,504
Good night, see you.
- Bye.

677
01:01:48,923 --> 01:01:50,049
Hello.
- Yes.

678
01:01:50,591 --> 01:01:52,968
Take your bag.
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

679
01:01:53,052 --> 01:01:54,345
Or else you will trouble us
in the middle of the night.

680
01:01:54,428 --> 01:01:55,471
Good night.

681
01:01:55,596 --> 01:01:56,722
Bye.
- Bye.

682
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:21,872
lt is a very bad thing..

683
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:25,334
..following someone in the
middle of the night..

684
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:29,088
..keeping a watch on them, it
is a kind of an invasion.

685
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:33,342
That.. l..
- Don't try to give reasons.

686
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:38,472
l know that you are just following
Malik sir's orders.

687
01:02:41,475 --> 01:02:42,560
So what are your intentions now?

688
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:45,062
You have followed me.

689
01:02:46,564 --> 01:02:48,983
lf you are still not satisfied..

690
01:02:50,084 --> 01:02:51,251
..then keep sitting in the
car the entire night.

691
01:02:52,419 --> 01:02:55,506
lf you want, shall l send
a coffee for you?

692
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:00,427
No, there is no need for that.

693
01:03:02,513 --> 01:03:05,974
You go home, l am leaving.

694
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:08,519
You go.

695
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:28,330
Yes Kabir - Where are you, Shivam?
- What's going on in the club?

696
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:30,541
Ronnie is here.

697
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:32,543
No l don't want to talk to Ronnie.

698
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:35,003
Tell him that..

699
01:03:35,963 --> 01:03:37,214
You scoundrel!

700
01:03:38,006 --> 01:03:40,050
Hello, hello.. are you alright?
Shivam..

701
01:03:43,262 --> 01:03:44,847
Hello Shivam.
ls there any problem?

702
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,390
No, a car..

703
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:53,355
Car? Shivam, what are you talking?
Shivam..

704
01:03:54,606 --> 01:03:56,191
l will call you later.

705
01:04:23,135 --> 01:04:24,887
No Reema, l have come
all the way here..

706
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:27,139
..from Pakistan, just
to take you back!

707
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:30,059
For the sake of Allah,
let's go from here.

708
01:04:30,142 --> 01:04:32,895
Bilal, when Malik sir brought
me here from Bangkok..

709
01:04:32,978 --> 01:04:36,023
..then l made a compromise with life.

710
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,155
Now l am just his slave..

711
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:45,115
..l don't dream about freedom anymore.

712
01:04:46,158 --> 01:04:48,619
Reema you are advancing towards hell..

713
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,537
..and l will not let
that happen Reema.

714
01:04:50,913 --> 01:04:55,167
Listen to me let's go back
to our country Reema.

715
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,920
Why don't you understand,
l cannot risk your life..

716
01:04:58,003 --> 01:05:01,507
..for my freedom.

717
01:05:02,257 --> 01:05:03,926
And if Malik's men see
you here, then..

718
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:05,177
Then he will kill me, isn't it?

719
01:05:06,011 --> 01:05:08,430
But l cannot see you
enslaved here Reema.

720
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,016
But Bilal..
- Those people..

721
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:14,645
Listen to me, we only
have tonight Reema.

722
01:05:15,604 --> 01:05:17,523
Today even Shivam is not
keeping a watch on you.

723
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,652
l.. l.. l have booked two
tickets for Lahore, Reema.

724
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,654
Don't worry about me Reema.

725
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,115
Just pack your bags, and come with me.

726
01:05:30,202 --> 01:05:31,203
No, not more than that..

727
01:05:31,286 --> 01:05:33,330
..we are going to finish
it within 4 months.

728
01:05:33,414 --> 01:05:34,581
Wonderful.
- Thank you.

729
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,961
Tell me Shivam.
- Sir you were right..

730
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:40,963
..there is someone in her life.

731
01:05:42,464 --> 01:05:44,967
Sir, his name is Bilal and he
is with Reema right now..

732
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,344
..in Reema's house.

733
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:49,972
They are planning to go
to Pakistan tonight, sir.

734
01:05:50,055 --> 01:05:51,098
Kill her.

735
01:05:52,641 --> 01:05:53,726
What sir.

736
01:05:58,564 --> 01:05:59,606
Kill her.

737
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:03,235
Yes sir.

738
01:06:33,766 --> 01:06:35,017
Reema! Reema, open the door..

739
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,394
..it is almost time for the flight.

740
01:06:38,187 --> 01:06:39,605
Reema, we might be late..

741
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:49,782
No! No!

742
01:06:49,823 --> 01:06:52,785
No! No! No!

743
01:06:52,826 --> 01:06:54,578
No, leave her.
- Bilal. - Go!

744
01:06:57,456 --> 01:06:58,499
Shivam!

745
01:07:02,461 --> 01:07:03,587
No Shivam!

746
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:06,465
Shivam, no please leave him!

747
01:07:06,548 --> 01:07:07,591
Leave him.

748
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:10,011
Shivam!

749
01:07:12,305 --> 01:07:15,308
Shivam, please Shivam!

750
01:07:20,062 --> 01:07:22,315
Please leave him!

751
01:07:25,902 --> 01:07:26,944
Please Shivam!

752
01:07:27,028 --> 01:07:28,070
Shivam no!

753
01:07:28,154 --> 01:07:29,322
No Shivam, please leave him!

754
01:07:30,698 --> 01:07:32,241
lt is all my fault!

755
01:07:32,325 --> 01:07:33,701
Let him go!

756
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:41,209
Please listen to me, for
the sake of Allah.

757
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:45,004
For Gods sake.

758
01:07:46,964 --> 01:07:50,092
Please! Please let him go!

759
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,053
Please Shivam!

760
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,183
You want to kill, don't you!

761
01:07:58,267 --> 01:07:59,352
Kill me!

762
01:07:59,769 --> 01:08:00,853
Kill me!

763
01:08:01,771 --> 01:08:04,357
But you cannot force me like this!

764
01:08:05,024 --> 01:08:07,068
l don't want this life of slavery!

765
01:08:08,903 --> 01:08:11,155
lt is my right to be free!

766
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,284
You cannot snatch my right from me!

767
01:08:15,952 --> 01:08:17,328
Leave me.

768
01:08:18,246 --> 01:08:20,623
lt is my right to be free!

769
01:08:20,706 --> 01:08:21,999
Please Shivam, please.

770
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:24,043
For Gods sake.

771
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:25,336
Spare us, let us go!

772
01:08:28,965 --> 01:08:30,091
Please.

773
01:08:33,094 --> 01:08:34,345
Let him go!

774
01:08:36,138 --> 01:08:37,640
'No matter, set this bird free..

775
01:08:37,723 --> 01:08:40,393
..Allah will shower his grace on you.'

776
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,979
Shivam, please Shivam!

777
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:45,773
For the sake of Allah!

778
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:48,651
'lf you don't believe me,
then free these birds..

779
01:08:48,734 --> 01:08:51,654
..and when Allah will shower
his grace on you..

780
01:08:51,737 --> 01:08:53,781
..and your soul will find peace..

781
01:08:53,865 --> 01:08:55,408
..then you will start believing it.'

782
01:08:57,743 --> 01:08:59,328
For Gods sake.

783
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:02,415
Please, spare us!

784
01:10:21,804 --> 01:10:22,889
Hello.

785
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:30,313
Hello.

786
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:40,907
Why didn't you kill her?

787
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:42,784
Why couldn't you fire?

788
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:44,660
Tell me. Tell me.

789
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:57,924
l don't know l fired 6 bullets
from the distance of 6 feet.

790
01:11:09,852 --> 01:11:10,937
But not one hit her.

791
01:11:12,358 --> 01:11:14,318
l don't know how l missed my aim.

792
01:11:14,652 --> 01:11:16,612
My hands did not work.

793
01:11:17,863 --> 01:11:20,658
Like.. like it was some miracle.

794
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:25,871
l don't believe it that
you are saying all this.

795
01:11:26,372 --> 01:11:27,456
You are an atheist, aren't you?

796
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,875
Since when did you start believing
in all these things?

797
01:11:30,877 --> 01:11:31,961
You are talking nonsense.

798
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,838
You couldn't fire, as if the
Lord descended himself..

799
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,549
..and saved her, isn't it.

800
01:11:37,383 --> 01:11:39,844
Shivam the truth is that you
didn't want to kill her.

801
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,056
Now because of her,
both of us will die.

802
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,850
Malik will not spare both of us.

803
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,435
Now you tell me what we should do.

804
01:11:49,187 --> 01:11:50,230
Tell me.

805
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:01,574
This is my bank account number.

806
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,412
There are 8 lakh dollars in it.

807
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,333
Withdraw it as soon as possible.

808
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,418
We are going back to lndia
in the first flight.

809
01:12:13,878 --> 01:12:17,382
Back, that means we will
have to run again.

810
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:21,469
Three years ago we fled from
our country and came here.

811
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,930
We were doing fine here.

812
01:12:24,013 --> 01:12:25,890
We have got a chance
to earn good money..

813
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,308
..and you are asking me to go back.

814
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,895
Why Shivam, why should we
lock horns with Malik sir..

815
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,189
..for a Pakistani girl.

816
01:12:34,232 --> 01:12:35,275
We are not going anywhere!

817
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,611
And we will not risk our
life for some girl.

818
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:40,113
Do you understand?

819
01:12:41,573 --> 01:12:42,991
l will kill her right now!

820
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:48,538
l will take all the decisions
in our friendship, and not you.

821
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:51,499
Will you do what l am asking you to?

822
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:54,419
Will you do it?

823
01:12:58,923 --> 01:13:00,592
lf you want l can even
give my life for you.

824
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:13,939
l will reach the airport in
two hours with the passport..

825
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:15,941
..you reach the airport
too with the money.

826
01:13:49,064 --> 01:13:50,106
Where is Shivam?

827
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:57,299
Why are you surprised
to see Kabir with me?

828
01:14:58,592 --> 01:15:01,052
He is just your friend..

829
01:15:01,136 --> 01:15:05,140
..you meant to me more than my son.

830
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,812
l had asked you to kill Reema.

831
01:15:12,564 --> 01:15:13,648
She is alive.

832
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:19,070
What has happened between us Shivam..

833
01:15:19,154 --> 01:15:23,158
..that today you are
standing against me!

834
01:15:25,577 --> 01:15:29,080
Do you know Shivam, the river
that flows near the villages..

835
01:15:29,164 --> 01:15:32,584
..sometimes enters the villages
too during the rains.

836
01:15:34,669 --> 01:15:38,089
But then we don't change the
direction of the river..

837
01:15:38,173 --> 01:15:41,843
..but we wait, for the
storm to die down.

838
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:46,431
l will give you one more chance.

839
01:15:47,599 --> 01:15:50,101
The work that you have
left incomplete..

840
01:15:50,185 --> 01:15:52,187
..complete it.

841
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:55,690
No sir.

842
01:16:05,617 --> 01:16:06,868
l cannot do this.

843
01:16:14,668 --> 01:16:16,670
Now you will kill Reema.

844
01:16:20,131 --> 01:16:25,345
You will kill Reema, only you.

845
01:16:31,643 --> 01:16:35,605
Make him suffer until he doesn't
realise his mistake.

846
01:16:51,788 --> 01:16:54,749
A man progresses with the
decisions that he takes.

847
01:16:55,834 --> 01:16:56,918
You did the right thing.

848
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:00,922
You'll surely achieve something one
day if you remain the same way.

849
01:17:46,885 --> 01:17:47,969
Can l come in?

850
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:42,943
Ronnie.

851
01:18:46,364 --> 01:18:47,448
Ronnie!

852
01:18:50,117 --> 01:18:57,500
Ronnie, No! Stop!

853
01:19:02,463 --> 01:19:05,007
Ronnie, No! Stop! Ronnie!

854
01:19:21,816 --> 01:19:22,858
Do you know Gini?

855
01:19:29,036 --> 01:19:35,167
Once l thought of adopting a pet dog.

856
01:19:37,169 --> 01:19:38,379
l went to the market.

857
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:42,508
There were many good dogs,
of high breed.

858
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:49,557
But l did not like anyone.

859
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:57,857
Suddenly my eyes fell on a bitch
(Female dog) in the corner..

860
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:00,901
..she was very weak, dirty and puny.

861
01:20:02,445 --> 01:20:03,571
l liked her.

862
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:10,911
The shopkeeper told me,
don't take her.

863
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:13,414
She is ill.

864
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:16,250
She will die.

865
01:20:18,878 --> 01:20:22,423
l didn't listen, l brought her home.

866
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:32,224
l gave her a bath, brought
her up took care of her.

867
01:20:34,977 --> 01:20:40,107
Gini and your story
is exactly the same.

868
01:20:44,487 --> 01:20:47,615
There is only one difference.

869
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:53,371
She turned out to be loyal.

870
01:21:24,905 --> 01:21:26,781
Congratulations.

871
01:21:28,992 --> 01:21:30,035
Congratulations.

872
01:21:33,914 --> 01:21:35,957
You even defeated death Shivam.

873
01:21:41,004 --> 01:21:42,505
But l can't understand..

874
01:21:42,589 --> 01:21:46,885
..has your life increased
or your pain.

875
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:51,473
Come here, dig another hole.

876
01:21:52,557 --> 01:21:54,226
Let's give him a bath.

877
01:21:55,018 --> 01:21:58,563
Before burying the corpse, we
will have to give him a bath.

878
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:30,262
A gift for you, dad has sent it.

879
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:32,264
Open it, open it.

880
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:46,695
You have lost your pride
but not your ego.

881
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,287
Here.

882
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:00,625
Call and apologise to Malik sir.

883
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:04,546
You are a very fortunate guy..

884
01:23:04,629 --> 01:23:07,132
..you have got another chance.

885
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:12,679
Do what Malik sir has asked
you to, kill Reema.

886
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:17,642
You have ten minutes.

887
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:44,044
l know him.

888
01:23:47,214 --> 01:23:48,256
He will not apologize.

889
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:53,970
After ten minutes, kill him.

890
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:59,269
l am sorry sir.

891
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:14,285
l don't believe this.

892
01:24:15,454 --> 01:24:16,538
You apologised.

893
01:24:18,623 --> 01:24:21,126
When your life is at stake..

894
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:24,504
..then the principles of life change.

895
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:28,884
Yes sir, yes sir.

896
01:24:45,484 --> 01:24:46,568
Yes dad..

897
01:26:04,271 --> 01:26:05,313
Kill him!

898
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:56,643
Dad.

899
01:27:57,686 --> 01:27:58,854
Dad.

900
01:28:00,689 --> 01:28:01,732
Uncle Rajan has come.

901
01:28:20,959 --> 01:28:24,671
So.. l heard that Shivam has fled.

902
01:28:29,718 --> 01:28:30,761
Stop him! Catch him!

903
01:28:33,805 --> 01:28:34,848
l don't believe this.

904
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:38,393
lf you would have handed
this work to me..

905
01:28:38,477 --> 01:28:40,812
..then he would have been dead by now.

906
01:28:41,938 --> 01:28:49,654
Because of him, you took up
enmity with your own kin.

907
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:55,619
All your cleverness has failed.

908
01:28:59,956 --> 01:29:01,124
The child is right.

909
01:29:08,006 --> 01:29:10,133
l don't know how to
recognise a person.

910
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:14,679
l am tired baba.

911
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:21,186
Now l can't handle this
business alone.

912
01:29:25,524 --> 01:29:27,109
l want your support.

913
01:29:28,777 --> 01:29:31,446
ln return, money, partnership..

914
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:34,074
..l will give you all that you want.

915
01:29:37,452 --> 01:29:39,121
Just bring Shivam to me.

916
01:29:40,914 --> 01:29:44,960
Bring him to me. Alive.

917
01:29:47,671 --> 01:29:49,965
l want to kill him myself.

918
01:30:07,107 --> 01:30:08,567
Shivam is already dead.

919
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,946
Only his last rites
are to be performed.

920
01:30:14,823 --> 01:30:19,036
Now only the Lord can
save him in Hong Kong.

921
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:28,563
Don't get up, don't get
up, don't get up..

922
01:31:28,647 --> 01:31:30,982
..keep lying.

923
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,447
Whatever happened, you
are safe here. Keep lying.

924
01:32:14,193 --> 01:32:18,322
# Why didn't l believe you? #

925
01:32:18,405 --> 01:32:23,202
# Why did l stay away from you? #

926
01:32:23,285 --> 01:32:27,873
# Life kept committing
atrocities on me. #

927
01:32:28,123 --> 01:32:32,336
# You are the one that
has given me shelter. #

928
01:32:32,419 --> 01:32:41,845
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

929
01:32:42,137 --> 01:32:51,438
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

930
01:32:54,775 --> 01:32:55,818
Where is he?

931
01:32:58,153 --> 01:32:59,238
Where is he?

932
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:05,411
Look, my men will find that
boy sooner or later.

933
01:33:06,245 --> 01:33:07,913
lt will be better for
you that you tell me.

934
01:33:12,543 --> 01:33:16,922
Your silence will be
your biggest enmity.

935
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,176
l will take you back
to the same place..

936
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,721
..from where l had bought you.

937
01:33:25,681 --> 01:33:27,433
That's the right place for you.

938
01:33:29,727 --> 01:33:31,729
You will never fall short
of lovers there.

939
01:33:32,229 --> 01:33:36,192
You will look for one, but
you will find many..

940
01:33:36,275 --> 01:33:40,237
..and they will use
you so many times..

941
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:42,740
..that you will never ever think
of falling in love again.

942
01:33:44,742 --> 01:33:47,953
From now on you just
wait for that day.

943
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,222
'l was telling Allah
to make you believe..

944
01:34:06,305 --> 01:34:09,266
..to make you a believer
from an atheist.'

945
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,228
'No matter in what form and
way you believe in him..

946
01:34:12,311 --> 01:34:14,605
..but do believe in him.'

947
01:34:17,608 --> 01:34:21,987
'l want us to be together even
after we are dead, in heaven.'

948
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:24,281
'And only those people stay
together in heaven..

949
01:34:24,323 --> 01:34:25,658
..who believe in God.'

950
01:34:41,799 --> 01:34:49,598
# What is this suffering?
What is this punishment? #

951
01:34:50,808 --> 01:34:59,441
# Why did l think of you today? #

952
01:34:59,525 --> 01:35:03,863
# My days are restless, restless
are my nights. #

953
01:35:03,946 --> 01:35:08,450
# Tell me what l should do. #

954
01:35:08,701 --> 01:35:17,835
# My feet are my chains,
free me from myself. #

955
01:35:17,918 --> 01:35:26,886
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

956
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:36,020
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

957
01:35:36,353 --> 01:35:45,738
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

958
01:35:55,664 --> 01:36:04,882
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

959
01:36:17,895 --> 01:36:20,356
You will leave for lndia
today evening..

960
01:36:20,397 --> 01:36:23,025
..l have made all the arrangements.

961
01:36:23,817 --> 01:36:26,362
We have a monk that has
a shipping company..

962
01:36:26,403 --> 01:36:29,073
..he will take you to Kolkata.

963
01:36:29,907 --> 01:36:31,075
Without the passport.

964
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:34,411
You don't worry, everything
will be fine.

965
01:36:37,706 --> 01:36:38,749
What are you thinking?

966
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:43,379
These people, just to help people
in their sorrows and pains..

967
01:36:43,462 --> 01:36:46,048
..had given up salvation and nirvana.

968
01:36:50,469 --> 01:36:56,100
And me, who is running from
here to save my life.

969
01:36:59,395 --> 01:37:00,646
How long can l run?

970
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:05,401
How long will l carry
on with this useless..

971
01:37:05,484 --> 01:37:07,111
..and disrespected life.

972
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:13,158
What will l do with such a life?

973
01:37:14,743 --> 01:37:16,412
l will become the slave
of some other Malik..

974
01:37:16,495 --> 01:37:18,122
..and follow his orders, that's all.

975
01:37:23,419 --> 01:37:27,423
Do you know Sood.. when
Aliyah's father..

976
01:37:27,506 --> 01:37:31,427
..had pointed the gun at me,
then l moved from the way..

977
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:36,140
..to save my life.

978
01:37:38,934 --> 01:37:40,978
l survived but she did not.

979
01:37:42,771 --> 01:37:44,190
And l just kept watching.

980
01:37:47,902 --> 01:37:48,986
l am doing the same thing today.

981
01:37:50,779 --> 01:37:53,532
l am hiding like cowards,
l am running.

982
01:37:56,118 --> 01:37:57,536
How long will l keep running?

983
01:37:59,038 --> 01:38:00,164
Where will l run off to, Sood.

984
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:04,460
There is no place in the world..

985
01:38:04,543 --> 01:38:06,462
..where her voice does not follow me.

986
01:38:12,968 --> 01:38:16,138
l have decided Sood, l will
not go back to lndia.

987
01:38:16,555 --> 01:38:19,516
l will not go.

988
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,479
Shivam, if you stay here
then Malik's men..

989
01:38:23,562 --> 01:38:24,605
..will seek you out and kill you.

990
01:38:26,106 --> 01:38:27,483
Because of the fear of death..

991
01:38:27,566 --> 01:38:28,817
..l had died even before my death.

992
01:38:33,489 --> 01:38:35,491
l have seen death from very close..

993
01:38:35,574 --> 01:38:37,493
..you will have to die for someone..

994
01:38:37,576 --> 01:38:39,537
..to make this life useful.

995
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:43,916
l will not die without uniting
Reema and Bilal.

996
01:38:46,085 --> 01:38:49,171
This slave will be free only
when he will set them free.

997
01:39:49,648 --> 01:39:50,691
Come on, sit inside.

998
01:39:52,902 --> 01:39:55,196
Bilal, sit inside.

999
01:39:58,908 --> 01:40:01,118
Get him!

1000
01:40:02,661 --> 01:40:05,080
Don't let him go! Don't let him go!
Bilal, stop!

1001
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:24,350
Bilal, stop! You scoundrel! Stop.

1002
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:43,244
Get him!

1003
01:41:17,152 --> 01:41:21,156
What are you thinking? Kill me.

1004
01:41:24,994 --> 01:41:26,078
Shoot.

1005
01:41:35,754 --> 01:41:38,299
These hands haven't changed
as much as you have Kabir.

1006
01:41:42,761 --> 01:41:44,346
Even if l wanted to,
l cannot shoot you.

1007
01:41:52,771 --> 01:41:56,859
Free me from this life, shoot me.

1008
01:41:59,403 --> 01:42:03,449
l have broken our friendship, shoot.

1009
01:42:05,075 --> 01:42:06,702
l will take all the decisions
in our friendship..

1010
01:42:06,785 --> 01:42:09,079
..and not you, do you understand!

1011
01:42:10,748 --> 01:42:14,460
And l say that you will live
and you will help me.

1012
01:42:15,794 --> 01:42:17,755
Take this boy to Siddharth
Sood's temple..

1013
01:42:17,796 --> 01:42:18,881
..and wait for me there.

1014
01:42:18,923 --> 01:42:21,342
l will bring Reema there,
did you understand.

1015
01:42:26,096 --> 01:42:28,474
Kabir tell me, you will do it.

1016
01:42:32,436 --> 01:42:34,897
l can even give my life for you.

1017
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,493
Trying to act smart.

1018
01:42:49,787 --> 01:42:50,829
You always cry.

1019
01:42:53,832 --> 01:42:54,917
Come on, go from here.

1020
01:42:56,126 --> 01:42:58,295
Where is Reema?

1021
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:03,050
Only Rajan and Munna knows that.

1022
01:44:09,158 --> 01:44:10,826
Go away. Go away. - Boss.

1023
01:44:22,838 --> 01:44:24,298
l have not come here to kill you.

1024
01:44:28,385 --> 01:44:30,346
Just tell me where is Reema.

1025
01:44:31,847 --> 01:44:33,307
l will quietly go from here.

1026
01:44:35,893 --> 01:44:37,102
The decision is yours.

1027
01:44:40,397 --> 01:44:41,440
What is this?

1028
01:44:45,194 --> 01:44:46,570
What is this Reema?

1029
01:44:48,864 --> 01:44:52,326
My brother is ready to
ruin his life for her.

1030
01:44:52,409 --> 01:44:54,495
You are ready to die for her.

1031
01:44:56,205 --> 01:44:57,581
What is this Reema?

1032
01:44:58,415 --> 01:45:00,209
ls she better than these girls?

1033
01:45:02,878 --> 01:45:07,883
You do one thing, l will
tell you where she is..

1034
01:45:07,967 --> 01:45:11,887
..bring her, bring her here.

1035
01:45:11,971 --> 01:45:13,430
Bring her here!

1036
01:45:14,431 --> 01:45:15,599
l will test her.

1037
01:45:17,476 --> 01:45:20,020
You too, Kim will test her too.

1038
01:45:20,563 --> 01:45:23,440
l will make entire Hong Kong test her.

1039
01:45:32,575 --> 01:45:33,617
Don't kill me.

1040
01:45:35,244 --> 01:45:37,663
l don't know anything, Munna
knows where she is.

1041
01:45:37,997 --> 01:45:39,331
Don't kill me.

1042
01:45:40,249 --> 01:45:41,292
Give a call to Munna.

1043
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:45,588
You scoundrel, don't trouble me.
l am reaching there.

1044
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:49,008
Tell me now. l've reached here.

1045
01:45:49,174 --> 01:45:50,259
Where are you?

1046
01:45:51,051 --> 01:45:54,263
l had told you to leave
my father and come to me.

1047
01:45:55,014 --> 01:45:57,183
l am standing here in the
parking lot, where are you?

1048
01:46:09,028 --> 01:46:10,196
Go from here.

1049
01:46:17,036 --> 01:46:20,956
You won't regret it but even
then l will tell you..

1050
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,209
..l have killed your father.

1051
01:46:29,173 --> 01:46:33,302
You should go, to shoulder
the pyre of your father.

1052
01:46:35,304 --> 01:46:37,515
You want to go, don't you?

1053
01:46:38,974 --> 01:46:42,019
But before that tell me, where
has Malik kept Rema.

1054
01:46:50,653 --> 01:46:53,072
ln Malik uncle's house in Macau.

1055
01:47:05,084 --> 01:47:06,126
Thank you.

1056
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:18,764
l am in the house!

1057
01:47:25,688 --> 01:47:27,648
You made a very big mistake.

1058
01:47:28,023 --> 01:47:30,442
You made a very big mistake
by locking horns with me.

1059
01:47:35,155 --> 01:47:39,034
Malik uncle wants to keep you alive..

1060
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,163
..but l am about to kill you.

1061
01:47:48,711 --> 01:47:52,298
My name is free and l am funky. Yeah.

1062
01:47:55,676 --> 01:47:58,137
Before dying, would you
like to hear a secret?

1063
01:47:58,387 --> 01:47:59,680
Would you like to hear it?

1064
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:04,351
Your Reema is in Malik uncle's
Chungking mansion.

1065
01:48:05,728 --> 01:48:07,396
And there she is being sold.

1066
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,065
And all of them, one after another..

1067
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:13,068
..one after another,
one after another..

1068
01:48:13,152 --> 01:48:14,361
..are going to rape her.

1069
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,201
Okay, time is up ready to die.

1070
01:48:20,284 --> 01:48:21,327
Thank you.

1071
01:48:22,161 --> 01:48:23,204
Thank you.

1072
01:49:03,202 --> 01:49:04,245
Hello.

1073
01:49:05,329 --> 01:49:06,872
Hello Shivam, all the
arrangements have been made.

1074
01:49:07,206 --> 01:49:08,249
Yes.

1075
01:49:08,332 --> 01:49:10,584
Kabir has handed over both
the passports to me.

1076
01:49:10,793 --> 01:49:12,127
Now you direct me.

1077
01:49:13,295 --> 01:49:15,130
Reach the Hong Kong docks for now..

1078
01:49:15,214 --> 01:49:17,758
..l will reach there along with Reema.

1079
01:49:18,801 --> 01:49:21,887
Shivam, they will kill you Shivam!

1080
01:49:22,346 --> 01:49:25,474
Nothing will happen
to me, listen to me.

1081
01:49:27,226 --> 01:49:31,146
l promise you, that you
will celebrate ld..

1082
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:32,356
..in your own country.

1083
01:49:33,315 --> 01:49:34,817
No Shivam don't go there,
Shivam don't..

1084
01:49:35,776 --> 01:49:36,819
Shivam, where are you?

1085
01:49:37,236 --> 01:49:41,490
Hello, hello.

1086
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,693
Please keep me alive
for some more time.

1087
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,698
Give me some more life.

1088
01:50:28,579 --> 01:50:34,376
Not for me, but for those
who believe in you.

1089
01:50:37,922 --> 01:50:39,381
l have committed many sins..

1090
01:50:44,303 --> 01:50:46,972
..give me one chance to repent for it.

1091
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:10,746
# The person inside me is saying. #

1092
01:51:12,331 --> 01:51:21,757
# lt is time to repay your debts. #

1093
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,428
# My eyes are filled with tears,
my breath hurts. #

1094
01:51:26,512 --> 01:51:30,975
# My wounds have become fresh again. #

1095
01:51:31,308 --> 01:51:35,771
# ln my loneliness and
in all my sagas. #

1096
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:40,609
# You were always with me. #

1097
01:51:40,651 --> 01:51:49,326
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1098
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:58,669
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1099
01:51:59,336 --> 01:52:07,970
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1100
01:52:08,762 --> 01:52:17,688
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1101
01:52:27,823 --> 01:52:36,874
# The relation between..
you and me is very old. #

1102
01:52:40,669 --> 01:52:41,795
Lower the guns!

1103
01:52:41,879 --> 01:52:42,922
Down! Down!

1104
01:52:54,808 --> 01:53:04,568
Well done, you did reach here
after all.. for this girl.

1105
01:53:07,905 --> 01:53:10,991
So, what are your intentions?

1106
01:53:12,701 --> 01:53:15,412
Malik sir, let them go.
- Or else.

1107
01:53:19,708 --> 01:53:22,086
You will kill me! You will kill me!

1108
01:53:27,466 --> 01:53:30,386
l didn't understand one thing Shivam..

1109
01:53:30,469 --> 01:53:34,390
..l treated you worse than animals.

1110
01:53:35,474 --> 01:53:38,102
But you tolerated it all,
for this girl!

1111
01:53:39,895 --> 01:53:44,108
You killed my brother you killed
Munna, for this girl!

1112
01:53:47,736 --> 01:53:50,072
But you didn't answer
one of my questions.

1113
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:52,533
Why?

1114
01:53:55,995 --> 01:53:58,122
Why didn't you kill this girl?

1115
01:54:03,752 --> 01:54:09,425
The voices, that keep
echoing in my ears..

1116
01:54:09,508 --> 01:54:14,471
..a face that always appears
in front of my eyes.

1117
01:54:16,765 --> 01:54:18,475
She was my peace.

1118
01:54:19,852 --> 01:54:22,438
She had said set the birds free..

1119
01:54:22,521 --> 01:54:25,983
..and Allah will shower
his grace on you.

1120
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:28,444
She had said, setting
a helpless free..

1121
01:54:28,527 --> 01:54:31,155
..means setting humanity free.

1122
01:54:33,532 --> 01:54:38,454
Today l have got the chance,
to follow what she said..

1123
01:54:38,537 --> 01:54:41,457
..to change.

1124
01:54:42,791 --> 01:54:46,462
Malik sir, those who cannot
fulfil their own dreams..

1125
01:54:46,545 --> 01:54:49,131
..they try to fulfil
the dreams of others.

1126
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,469
But you will not understand that.

1127
01:54:57,723 --> 01:55:00,476
You are doing this because,
you want to do a good deed..

1128
01:55:00,559 --> 01:55:03,521
..before you die!

1129
01:55:03,604 --> 01:55:09,151
You feel, that your Allah will
shower his grace on you.

1130
01:55:09,818 --> 01:55:12,029
Lord will give you place in heaven!

1131
01:55:12,112 --> 01:55:13,781
Rubbish!

1132
01:55:16,909 --> 01:55:19,119
Malik sir, l don't want
a place in heaven.

1133
01:55:20,496 --> 01:55:22,790
l have just come to save
this girl from hell.

1134
01:55:25,501 --> 01:55:33,092
l have chosen death myself,
for you and for me.

1135
01:56:34,236 --> 01:56:36,155
Come on Shivam, you go!

1136
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:37,907
You go, Bilal is waiting
for you on the docks.

1137
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:39,909
You go! Shivam, go!

1138
01:56:39,992 --> 01:56:41,243
Kabir.. Kabir come with me!

1139
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:38,717
Shivam! Shivam! Shivam!

1140
01:57:40,135 --> 01:57:41,637
Shivam, come on Shivam!

1141
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,138
Shivam, come on let's get out of here.

1142
01:57:43,222 --> 01:57:48,143
When l start firing, start
running towards the boat.

1143
01:57:48,185 --> 01:57:49,979
No Shivam!

1144
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:55,109
l cannot bear the burden of
this aimless life anymore.

1145
01:57:59,738 --> 01:58:01,991
For me, death is my destination.

1146
01:58:05,286 --> 01:58:07,329
Wait.. take this.

1147
01:58:17,172 --> 01:58:19,884
Reema, thank you for setting me free.

1148
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:22,094
Thank you.

1149
01:58:25,222 --> 01:58:26,307
Go.

1150
01:58:28,225 --> 01:58:29,268
Go.

1151
01:58:29,351 --> 01:58:30,394
Go.

1152
01:58:31,061 --> 01:58:32,897
Take her away! Take her away!

1153
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:37,443
No. no!

1154
01:58:39,069 --> 01:58:46,243
No! No! - Go! Shivam.. No!

1155
01:58:55,336 --> 01:58:57,463
Come on! - Shivam!

1156
01:59:03,802 --> 01:59:11,727
# Now lsha have to disappear.. #

1157
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:21,278
# ..from this scene.. #

1158
01:59:21,362 --> 01:59:30,996
# The path on which my
companion is waiting. #

1159
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:40,839
# l have to attain those paths. #

1160
01:59:40,923 --> 01:59:48,973
# So come again trouble me. #

1161
01:59:49,849 --> 01:59:59,483
# So come again and make me cry. #

1162
01:59:59,817 --> 02:00:07,741
# Come back again, come back
again, come back again. #

1163
02:00:07,825 --> 02:00:17,501
# Come back again, come back
again, come back again. #

1164
02:00:36,145 --> 02:00:39,815
And in this way, that vagabond
sacrificed his life..

1165
02:00:39,857 --> 02:00:42,151
..to set me free.

1166
02:00:43,861 --> 02:00:47,823
Today l have come here so
that we can set them free..

1167
02:00:47,865 --> 02:00:52,536
..who are enslaved against their will.

1168
02:00:53,871 --> 02:00:58,167
Whose screams and shrieks
are heard by no one!

1169
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:04,215
Because now they can be set free.

1170
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:09,053
Freedom is our right.

1171
02:01:56,225 --> 02:01:59,603
# Why didn't l believe you? #

1172
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:03,941
# Why did l stay away from you? #

1173
02:02:04,024 --> 02:02:07,611
# Life kept committing
atrocities on me. #

1174
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:12,032
# You are the one that
has given me shelter. #

1175
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:19,623
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1176
02:02:19,915 --> 02:02:27,590
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1177
02:02:28,007 --> 02:02:35,639
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1178
02:02:45,274 --> 02:02:51,614
# What is this suffering?
What is this punishment? #

1179
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:59,413
# Why did l think of you today? #

1180
02:02:59,496 --> 02:03:04,001
# My days are restless, restless
are my nights. #

1181
02:03:04,084 --> 02:03:08,047
# Tell me what l should do. #

1182
02:03:08,088 --> 02:03:15,971
# My feet are my chains,
free me from myself. #

1183
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:23,562
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1184
02:03:24,313 --> 02:03:31,737
# The relation between you
and me is very old. #

1185
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:47,753
# The person inside me is saying. #

1186
02:03:48,003 --> 02:03:55,761
# lt is time to repay your debts. #

1187
02:03:56,011 --> 02:04:00,099
# My eyes are filled with tears,
my breath hurts. #

1188
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:03,769
