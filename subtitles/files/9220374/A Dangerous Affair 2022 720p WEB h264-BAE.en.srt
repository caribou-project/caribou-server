00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,601
- Pierce?

00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,124
Pierce!

3
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:51,958
Someone help!

4
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,053

- Letting your core
do all the work.

14
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,150
Feeling that burn
is the indication.

15
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,282
That you are working
what you should be.

16
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,590
Flattening the
small of the back,

17
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:00,619
Squeezing those ab muscles.

18
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:02,697
Keep going.

00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:04,682

But Pilates, I feel like I'm
finally moving the needle.

27
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,027
To burning off
these love handles.

28
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,888
You know what I mean?

29
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,481
- I do.

30
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,788
- ugh, now I
just need to do something.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,290
About all these
lines on my face.

32
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,211
I say, bring me the Botox.

33
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,155
- I'm happy, you're
enjoying class, Barbara.

34
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:41,568
- Mm, he is like a Greek god.

35
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,662
- Do you know him?

36
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,237
- Mm-hm, that's pierce Dalton.

37
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,998
He owns Handsworth media corp,

38
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,307
The largest online
and print news company.

39
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,818
In the entire state.

40
00:02:50,913 --> 00:02:52,820
- I think I've heard of him.

41
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:56,491
- Well, I refer to him as the
trifecta because he is smart,

42
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,919
Rich and handsome as hell.

43
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,253
Oh, and rumour has it,

44
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:03,182
He is an absolute
tiger in the bedroom.

45
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,685
All I have to say is if
I were to have an affair,

46
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,671
Which I never would,
but if I were,

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,857
Pierce Dalton is my kryptonite.

48
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,767
Ah, pierce.

49
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,176
- Barb.

50
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:21,274
- I trust that you got
the invite to my party.

51
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,368
- I did.

52
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:25,370
- Oh, I didn't get an RSVP.

53
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:27,614
Oh my gosh, you need
to come to our party.

54
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,857
It is the perfect
place to meet everyone.

55
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:31,526
- Ah, okay, sure.

56
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,953
- Shoot, this is my daughter.

57
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,287
I've gotta run.

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,775
Okay, pierce, what
can I put you down as?

59
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,794
- Um, still thinking on it.

60
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:43,805
- Mm-hm, and you, I'm gonna
email you your invite, pronto.

61
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:45,874
- Bye, barb.

62
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,731
- Pierce Dalton.

63
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:54,900
That was a great class.

64
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:56,551
- Thanks.

65
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,070
- And nice work on advertising.

66
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:00,822
It's the, it's the man on
the ad that was the hook.

67
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,242
- Misleading?

68
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:05,049
- I mean, considering
I was the only guy.

69
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,745
In the class, maybe,

70
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,812
But it got me in here,
so guess it worked.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,917
When did you open?

72
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:12,900
- Ah, three weeks ago.

73
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,254
- Oh, and already a full class.

74
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,405
That's impressive.

75
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,589
- Thanks.

76
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,316
- So you're new to town?

77
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,818
- I am, I'm from Montreal,

78
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:23,585
But my dad is originally
from New Orleans,

79
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,673
So I feel like no better
time than the present.

80
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,675
To explore my American roots.

81
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:31,103
Florida was calling.

82
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:33,605
- Well, I never met a
Canadian I didn't like.

83
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:36,182
- I'll try and not
ruin that reputation.

84
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,854
- Um, I think I'd like
to get a membership.

85
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,614
- I think I can help with that.

86
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,952
- Cute dog, like his mum.

87
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:52,874
Emphasis on the word
cute, not, not dog.

88
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:56,778
- Trust me, I can be a real
bitch when I need to be.

89
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:01,374
So I'm not set up for
in-store payment yet,

90
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,877
But I can send you a link and
you can fill it out online.

91
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,137
I just need your email.

92
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:06,288
- okay.

93
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,464
- It's nice to meet you, pierce.

94
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:18,132
I'm Amelie, by the way.

95
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,467
Amelie Didot.

96
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,379
- A woman who decides
to change lives.

97
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:24,230
Of those around
her for the better,

98
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,066
In spite of her own isolation?

99
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:27,384
- You've seen the movie.

100
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:28,568
- It's an oldie but goodie,

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,495
And yes, three times.

102
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:32,814
It remains my favourite
foreign film to date.

103
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:33,908
- Oddly, mine too.

104
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,168
- See you soon.

105
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,336
- Mm-hm, I hope so.

106
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,499
We're closed.

107
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:52,258
Okay, all right, all right.

108
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,353
Um, one second.

109
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,246
Hi, I'm Amelie.

110
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:57,856
- Oh, thanks, I'm Fran.

111
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,514
Don't tell me that I
missed the last class.

112
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,849
- Ah, yeah,
unfortunately, you did.

113
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,527
- Oh, my god.

114
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,001
And, and I just saw that tall
hunk walk out of the class.

115
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:05,422
And I thought to myself,

116
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,855
"that's not a class
that wanna miss."

117
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,441
- Last class is always at four.

118
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,685
- Oh, okay, well, I'll
make it to the next one,

119
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,429
Only if you can promise me.

120
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,087
There'll be some more eye
candy like that in there.

121
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:16,616
- Ooh, I can make
no such promises.

122
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,284
- damn.

123
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:19,544
- Is that your car?

124
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:21,696
- Ah, she is.

125
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,547
- stick shift?

126
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,699
- Mm-hm, always.

127
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,609
I learned on it and then I...

128
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:28,053
- My mom had an old Volkswagen
that I used to drive,

129
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,630
And wow, that just brings
back some memories.

130
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:32,298
- All good, I hope.

131
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,726
- Except for the time johnny
Braxton broke up with me.

132
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:37,879
And spilled orange
soda all over my car.

133
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,140
It was the stickiest
mess I ever had.

134
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,808
I could never fully clean it up.

135
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,794
- Men are like little
children with breakups, right?

136
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:47,130
It's like they want a
little bit of attention.

137
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,316
And they just don't know
how to ask for it.

138
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:51,469
Sorry, that was weird.

139
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,821
Pilates, next Monday,
I'll be there,

140
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,146
And I won't be late this time.

141
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:57,239
- All right, well,
I'll see you there.

142
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,291
- Ciao.
- Bye.

143
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,402
Okay, so I just wanna make sure.

144
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:12,839
That I'm getting this right.

145
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,602
So there's an exterior
camera here and one here.

146
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,346
And then what?

147
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,671
I just download the app on my
phone and activate it later?

148
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,333
- yes, ma'am.

149
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,491
- okay, thank you so much.

150
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:25,351
- take care.

151
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,187
- Lived here nearly 10 years,

152
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,780
Never needed security cameras.

153
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,431
Safe neighbourhood.

154
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,266
- It was a free
upgrade with my cable.

155
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,860
And my Internet subscription.

156
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:37,180
- That's how they get you,
free for the first six months,

157
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,273
And god knows how
much after that.

158
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,367
I'm Margaret, by the way.

159
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,293
- Nice to meet you, Margaret.

160
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:42,627
I'm Amelie.

161
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:45,522
- I live alone, but
I love kids and dogs.

162
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,691
- I don't have any kids,
but I do have a dog.

163
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,542
- And a cute one at that.

164
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:51,619
I saw you walking him yesterday.

165
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,788
Mine died almost two years ago.

166
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,958
And I just never had the
gusto to get another,

167
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:59,478
So if you ever need anyone
to watch your little fella,

168
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,537
You let me know.

169
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,721
I'm home most of the time.

170
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:03,297
- I will, thank you, Margaret.

171
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,557
It's really nice to meet you.

172
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,391
Have a good day.

173
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:06,544
- You too, sweetheart.

174
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,552
- okay.

175
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:22,667
- gracias.

176
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:23,819
- Good boy.

177
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,911
Hi.
- Welcome, how are you?

178
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:27,747
- Can I please
get a new dog tag?

179
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,415
- Okay, your address?

180
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:30,416
- Thank you, right, the address.

181
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,928
The whole point, huh?

182
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:41,244
Okay, all good.

183
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,263
Thank you.

184
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:44,415
Buster?

185
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,100
Buster!

186
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,252
I'll be right back.

187
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,420
Buster!

188
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,030
Buster!

189
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:56,442
This is my number, okay?

190
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,702
I will.

191
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:58,854
Thank you.

192
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:13,969
- You're missing something?

193
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,798
- Oh my god, buster, hi, baby!

194
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,059
Oh my goodness.

195
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,302
How did you?

196
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,471
Right.

197
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:26,881
Hi.

198
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,882
- Yeah, found him
eating an ice cream cone.

199
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,143
Over in the park on west first.

200
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,070
Strawberry, I believe, right?

201
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,388
Yeah, so we stopped and
got something healthy

202
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:37,242
'cause I figured he was sneaking
dessert in before dinner.

203
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:39,561
- Thank you.

204
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,329
Seriously, you made my night.

205
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,974
I was getting his
dog tied engraved.

206
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:47,327
And I guess he was
exploring the neighbourhood.

207
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,996
- Ah, that would be why he
wasn't wearing his collar.

208
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,923
- I'm gonna send you a venmo.

209
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:52,982
- A reward?

210
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,667
- Yeah, a thousand bucks?

211
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,901
- Look, as much as I think that
buster is worth every penny.

212
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,346
And more, I, I can't.

213
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,256
- Your membership,
a year, on me.

214
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,158
- No, no, no.

215
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:03,493
I just, I can't accept that.

216
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,511
- We insist.

217
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:08,674
- Something tells me I'm
not gonna win this argument.

218
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:11,109
- No, not likely.

219
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:14,279
- Okay, how about
some private sessions?

220
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,438
Spread-eagling my legs in
front of a room full of women.

221
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,099
Was, dare I say, intimidating.

222
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,359
- Okay, all right, you got it.

223
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,953
As many free privates
as you can handle.

224
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
- Deal.

225
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:29,944
- Text message, someone spotted
buster on west and third.

226
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,643
I guess I should
take the post down.

227
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,690
Wow, it's already 6:30.

228
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,116
- Guessing you skip lunch?

229
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,526
- And breakfast.

230
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,470
- Right, well I'm taking
you for something.

231
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:41,030
- No, no, no, you
have done enough.

232
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,464
- I'm claiming it as
part of my reward.

233
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,717
Plus, you likely don't
know anywhere to eat.

234
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
In this town yet, so...

235
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,131
- Something tells me I'm
not gonna win this argument.

236
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,225
- No, not likely.

237
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:02,661
Cheese curds, gravy
and French fries.

238
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,222
- Don't forget the
ketchup on top.

239
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,056
- that's what you grew up on?

240
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,084
- Mm-hm, it's my favourite.

241
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:11,911
It's called poutine.

242
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,248
- Mm, and aside from buster,
I'm assuming no kids?

243
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,174
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:17,325
- No, never married?

245
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:20,995
- Divorced.

246
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,681
- Oh, geez, yeah.

247
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:25,398
See, I can tell by
the look on your face.

248
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,427
That that one didn't end well.

249
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:28,739
- You ask a lot of questions.

250
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,748
- I'm a journalist.

251
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:32,881
It comes to the territory.

252
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,194
We don't have to talk about it.

253
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:40,115
- No, it's, it's fine.

254
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:45,870
He cheated several times,

255
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,040
So yeah, it did not end well.

256
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,286
- Oh, thank you.

257
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:54,879
- Let me.
- Oh no, no, my treat.

258
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:03,371
- Thank you.

259
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,643
So what about you?

260
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,979
- Five kids, three
different moms.

261
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:14,141
- Seriously?

262
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:18,385
- Sometimes, sometimes,
seriously, yeah.

263
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,295
But no, definitely not that way.

264
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:20,296
- Okay.

265
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:21,315
- Never married, no kids.

266
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,390
Had one serious girlfriend once,

267
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,468
But that ended well
over a decade ago.

268
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,153
- Mm.
- Mm.

269
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:29,396
Dated someone briefly last year.

270
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:31,082
That ended with the bang.

271
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,475
- What happened?

272
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:35,328
- She was intense,
very, very intense.

273
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,422
- How so?

274
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,413
- Well, the first date was fun.

275
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,983
The second date was more fun.

276
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,835
And then the third
date went south.

277
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,504
We were at dinner,

278
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,432
And an old colleague of
mine was there with his wife.

279
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,573
And they wanted to join us
for a drink. They came over.

280
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,667
I thought we had a great time,
but at the end of the night,

281
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,441
She was adamant that my
friend's wife was hitting on me,

282
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
And I on her.

283
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,595
- Okay, well, were
you, or was she?

284
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,114
- Dolores is 71 years old.

285
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,524
- Okay.

286
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,923
- Yeah, with a serious
bout of chin hairs.

287
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,434
- mm.

288
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,028
- She feels like any older lady.

289
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,123
Who's been married for 40
years does in compliments,

290
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,608
And I was doing nothing more
than being amused by her.

291
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:16,185
- She sounds like my mom.

292
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:18,354
- Yeah, and she's old
enough to be mine, too.

293
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,282
- So what happened?

294
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,525
You broke it off after that?

295
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,694
- Do you really wanna
hear about this?

296
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:26,379
Come on.
- Only if you wanna tell me.

297
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,806
- Okay.

298
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:31,792
Well, we met because
we hired her tech firm.

299
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,301
To do some of our
social media stuff.

300
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,221
- Mm-hm, and?

301
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:37,565
- And she kind of, well,

302
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:39,893
How do I put this?

303
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:42,970
Started tracking me online.

304
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:45,204
Yeah, out of the blue, she
would bring up a tweet I've made.

305
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,416
Where I tagged the journalist.

306
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:48,207
Whose story would
published through her,

307
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:52,914
Retail owner who's
shop we have profiled.

308
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,259
In the local business section,

309
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:57,393
Accusations that I was
flirting with them,

310
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:59,245
Even though I'd never
met any of them.

311
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,419
The final straw came when
I came back from a run.

312
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,825
To find her standing outside
my house, waiting for me.

313
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,685
She looked like she
hadn't slept in a day,

314
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,162
And she flew into a rage.

315
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,348
About how I changed
my running route.

316
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:12,455
- She was monitoring
your jogging routine?

317
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,101
- I have no idea,
didn't ask her,

318
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:18,940
But to make a long story
short, I cut it off.

319
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:21,245
It had only been three weeks,

320
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:22,499
And that was really
long enough to realise.

321
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,151
That it was just
never gonna work.

322
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:28,258
Hm.

323
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:33,020
Hm.

324
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:34,114
- That's weird.

325
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,103
Barbara, reminder to RSVP.

326
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,121
- Same.

327
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,779
- It's an "eyes
wide shut" theme.

328
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,707
- Yeah, so now you know why
I was hesitating to RSVP.

329
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,283
- God, okay, call
me conservative,

330
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,112
But going to a wild
party in a town.

331
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,786
Where I literally
know two people.

332
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:53,966
Just sounds too
adventurous for me.

333
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,210
- Well, why don't you
make it more adventurous.

334
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:57,478
And just come as my date?

335
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,124
- Your date?

336
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,902
- Yeah, promise to
keep my clothes on.

337
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:05,645
"eyes wide shut" theme.

338
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,553
- Right.

339
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:07,388
- get it?

340
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:08,314
- Oh, I get it.

341
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,574
- okay.

342
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:12,327
Put your number in there.

343
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,655
What's your favourite song?

344
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:17,140
- My favourite song?

345
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,917
Something from your top ten.

346
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:20,567
- Um...

347
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:21,753
- Oh, I got it.

348
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:23,813
- Got what?

349
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:27,150
♪ It's a perfect day ♪

350
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,834
What's happening?

351
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:29,669
- It's your theme
song in my phone.

352
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:31,262
- That's my ring tone?

353
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:32,505
- In, in my phone, yeah.

354
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:35,099
♪ Whatever come, what may ♪

355
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:36,740
- Okay, yeah, you've
good taste in music.

356
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:37,752
- Mm, thanks.

357
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,337
- Giving me a ring tone in
your phone gives you props.

358
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,089
- Does it?

359
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:43,499
- mm-hm.

360
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:44,933
- Does that mean I'm
picking you up at seven?

361
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:45,851
- Seven it is.

362
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,188
♪ Makes me feel ♪

363
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,700
♪ this perfect night for me ♪

364
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,541
- Wow.

365
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,467
You look-

366
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:10,693
- It's too much, I know.

367
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,378
I just didn't have time to-

368
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,714
- gorgeous.

369
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,290
- Really?

370
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,049
- Stunningly so.

371
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,143
These of you.

372
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:20,311
- They're beautiful, thank you.

373
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,983
- Your chariot awaits, my lady.

374
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,585
- oh, it's a beautiful party,

375
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,931
And you're a beautiful woman.

376
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,593
- Drinks?

377
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:18,703
- oh, my, oh, my.

378
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,099
- Uh, sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

379
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,284
- I can be anyone you want.

380
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,527
- Uh, that's okay.

381
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:27,795
Thank you, not tonight.

382
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:33,534
- oh, it must
have been my gold mask.

383
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:40,283
- I love what you did,
and we will, absolutely.

384
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:41,708
- thank you, pierce.

385
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:42,803
- here you go.

386
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:44,879
- thanks.

387
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:46,899
Everything okay?

388
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,400
- Everything's fine.

389
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:51,450
Just saw man that I thought
was you from behind.

390
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,813
- Hm, did he hit on you?

391
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:55,573
- He did, actually.

392
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:56,724
- Va-va-voom!

393
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,136
Look at you two.

394
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:01,487
- Barbara?

395
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,639
- The one and only.

396
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:03,472
- wow.

397
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:04,807
- Hey, bud.

398
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:07,643
- Frank, thanks so
much for the invite.

399
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,736
- Are my eyes playing faint.

400
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,331
Or did you and pierce
arrive together?

401
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,574
- We did.

402
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,577
- Oof, you lucky, lucky girl.

403
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,671
- Okay, chocolate mint martinis,

404
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,848
How did they warm their
way into the theme?

405
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,995
- Well, dark chocolate is
an aphrodisiac, my dear.

406
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,680
How do you not know that?

407
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:29,322
- Barbara, I can't
believe you live here.

408
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:32,276
This place is massive.

409
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:36,689
- It's way too large for us,
but Barbara refuses to move.

410
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,765
- Mm, what can I say?

411
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,785
I like them big.

412
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,287
- Okay.

413
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,514
Do you mind if I
give her the tour?

414
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:48,868
- Of course, feel
free to wander.

415
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:49,962
- cheers.

416
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:51,301
- That's the theme of the party.

417
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:57,635
- This place is, it's
like an art gallery.

418
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,870
- appropriate, wouldn't you say,

419
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,842
For the great granddaughter
of Harold Gershwin?

420
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:07,311
- The minimalist
artist of the 1920s?

421
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:08,629
- that's the one.

422
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,722
- Oh, wow, okay,

423
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,983
So these are...

424
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,043
- Very expensive.

425
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,061
- hmm.

426
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,047
- Beautiful, isn't it?

427
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,066
- yeah, it is.

428
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:24,069
- What do you think has
transpired between them?

429
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:26,831
- Oh, art is about perception.

430
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,169
It's in the eye of the
beholder, isn't it?

431
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:32,912
- It is.

432
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:35,006
So what would yours be of this?

433
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,093
- An argument, maybe?

434
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,849
He's asked for forgiveness, and,

435
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:51,189
And, she's given in, again.

436
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,176
What's yours?

437
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:57,445
What is your perception?

438
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,201
- Well, he's, he's worried.

439
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,704
She's exhausted.

440
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,857
Maybe he saved her.

441
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:24,296
He really hurt you, didn't
he, your ex-husband?

442
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,390
- He did.

443
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,648
Cheating, you know, it
just feels like betrayal.

444
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,721
Over and over
again, he would cry.

445
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,075
And pledge he would
never do it again,

446
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:48,079
And I would forgive him,

447
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,499
Losing a little bit
of myself each time,

448
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:58,256
My, my self esteem diminishing.

449
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,511
Until I didn't even
recognise myself anymore.

450
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,267
I became numb.

451
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:18,109
No more desire, no
more lust for him.

452
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,280
I, I just was.

453
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,454
The worst part was
that I became someone.

454
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,456
Who couldn't even...

455
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
- Trust anymore?

456
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
- Exactly.

457
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,475
- You're beautiful,
Amelie Didot,

458
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:54,721
Inside and out.

459
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:06,157
Should we continue the tour?

460
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:09,386
- Let's.

461
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:12,413
Is the lady's room that way?

462
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,333
- Yes, it is.

463
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,567
Why don't I grab us
a plate of appetiser.

464
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,563
And meet outside in five?

465
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:21,581
- Perfect.

466
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:46,514
- Oh, sorry.

467
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,555
- Pierce?

468
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,618
Pierce?

469
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,544
Oh my god, someone help me!

470
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,304
Someone help!

471
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,569
- Amelie?

472
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,479
- Pierce?

473
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:42,144
- If you remember anything
else, here's my card.

474
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:43,163
- Thank you.

475
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,007
- I can be anyone you want.

476
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,268
- Let's get you home.

477
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,108
- Reach those arms up
to the sky on an inhale,

478
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:05,926
Straight as a board.

479
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,446
Exhale, bring them down to
your side and curl the spine,

480
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:11,857
Drawing the navel in as tight
as you can to the spine.

481
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,433
And if that's too hard Fran,

482
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:14,667
You can just bring them right
back down into tabletop.

483
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:15,679
Nice job.

484
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:17,847
Good job.

485
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:19,105
Hold that position.

486
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,792
Belly drawing in
toward the spine.

487
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,463
- I need to talk
to you after class.

488
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:26,614
- Sure, sure thing.

489
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,692
All right, good job, nice.

490
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,360
Keep those arms straight.

491
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:33,804
Just 30, more seconds
in this position.

492
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,647
Bye, ladies, good job today.

493
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,485
- Wow, great class.

494
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:49,803
- You know, I have a
three-for-five promo.

495
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:51,304
Going on right now.

496
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,554
Maybe you wanna
sign up for that?

497
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,550
- I actually saw that
in the newspaper.

498
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,484
- It's good to know all my
advertising is paying off.

499
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,496
- Sure is.

500
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:00,321
- Are you doing
some construction?

501
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,075
- Oh no, that's just, that's
the little side thing.

502
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:04,502
I got a project that I'm doing.

503
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:07,402
- You know, it looks like
your pen exploded in your bag.

504
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,414
- Oh, shoot!

505
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:10,156
Damn it.

506
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,074
- I destroyed my favourite
satchel with an exploded pen.

507
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:13,752
It's the worst.

508
00:25:13,904 --> 00:25:15,744
I never carry pens in
my purse after that.

509
00:25:15,756 --> 00:25:16,514
Hey barb.

510
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,182
- I, I've gotta run.

511
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,082
I got a call from my daughter,
but I will call you later.

512
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:21,519
- Okay, is everything okay?

513
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:22,353
- It's fine.

514
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,746
- Bye, barb.

515
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:24,764
- Uh-huh.

516
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,417
- Well, if you
find a plan online,

517
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,017
Just feel free to
sign up for it.

518
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,029
- Sure.

519
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,684
- Uh, I hate to rush
you out the door,

520
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,538
I just, I have a private
session starting soon.

521
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,431
- Oh, you teach
private lessons now?

522
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,950
- Yeah, it's just the
one client right now,

523
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,953
And it's, it's kind of a
pro Bono type of thing.

524
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:48,954
- Really?

525
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:51,456
- Yeah, my dog ran off,

526
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:54,868
And, and he actually found him.

527
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,279
This is what he
wanted for the reward.

528
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:59,372
- It's not the hunk I
saw leaving your class.

529
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,541
When I missed it the other day?

530
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,726
- It is, actually.

531
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,189
- I'll think about
that membership.

532
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:14,530
- Thanks for coming?

533
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:23,747
Mm, seriously?

534
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,097
- You all right?

535
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:42,991
- Yeah, yeah, I
just got this client.

536
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:44,918
Break my picture frame though.

537
00:26:45,012 --> 00:26:46,753
- What do you mean?

538
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,772
- She slammed it down,
breaking the glass.

539
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,166
- That's weird.

540
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:53,277
- Yeah, just added to
all the other weirdness.

541
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:54,428
Happening as of late.

542
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,613
- hmm.

543
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,324
- Guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

544
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:00,843
Speaking of which, any leads?

545
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:02,194
- No, not really.

546
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:04,696
Police are still keeping
the case pretty quiet.

547
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:05,946
I'm waiting on more information.

548
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,683
Before I publish
anything in my paper.

549
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,852
We're working on a pass for now.

550
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,434
- Have you ever covered
a murder before?

551
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:13,797
- Yes, but not one
in my own backyard.

552
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:17,042
It's all a little bit bizarre,

553
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,878
Where it was and, you know, you.

554
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,787
- Me?

555
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,806
Ah.
- Oh.

556
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,032
- You know what?

557
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,309
I have band-aids.

558
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:30,314
- Yeah, you know, just how
you found him and all that.

559
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,319
- It's like a bad dream.

560
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:39,017
Not too mention, barb wouldn't
even look at me today.

561
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:41,009
Maybe she feels weird
seeing me because of it.

562
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:43,402
- No, I doubt that.

563
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,812
I'm sure she just feels
the same as you about it.

564
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,572
After all, it did
happen in her home.

565
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:48,832
- Yeah.

566
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,157
- I also learned
that the man, Brian,

567
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,294
Was a university
friend of Frank's,

568
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,005
Probably was quite a good one.

569
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,232
So, you know,

570
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,902
I think everyone's just
feeling little out of sorts.

571
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:01,403
- Yeah, you're probably right.

572
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:02,680
- There we are.

573
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:03,997
Good as new.

574
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,424
- Thanks, doctor.

575
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:07,518
- Take my advice,
I know it's hard,

576
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,762
Just try and forget about it.

577
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:13,023
- I'm trying, trust me.

578
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:16,101
You wanna get started?

579
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,195
- Let's do it.

580
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,374
- Perfect.

581
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,120
- I just wanna make sure your
core is doing all the work.

582
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:37,272
You shouldn't be feeling
anything in your back.

583
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,201
Old pro, it seems.

584
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,130
- No.

585
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:46,282
- That's it.

586
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:47,374
All right.

587
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,711
- Okay, how do I
dismount this thing?

588
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:52,471
- I believe in you.

589
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,565
- Gratefully.

590
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,407
- Okay, lay down onto your back.

591
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,233
We're gonna do my
favourite, bridges.

592
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,649
Okay, feet pushing the floor,
arms down by your side.

593
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,784
We're gonna inhale, and
one vertebrae at a time,

594
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:08,820
We're gonna roll up
through our spine, okay?

595
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:09,973
Inhale.

596
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:24,928
Mm-hm, and we're just
gonna pulse at the top.

597
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,585
- like this?

598
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:33,679
- Yeah, just like that.

599
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:38,166
- I feel ridiculous.

600
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:40,612
Okay.

601
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:43,763
There you go, you got it.

602
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:44,783
- No, I like this.

603
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:49,102
- you do, do you?

604
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,455
Okay, it's close,
but can I show you?

605
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:52,606
- Sure, yeah.

606
00:30:05,712 --> 00:30:08,530
- See how I'm squeezing
my butt muscles?

607
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,297
You wanna make sure you're
not feeling anything.

608
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,309
In your back.

609
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:15,220
See?

610
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,480
- Oh, yes I, uh,

611
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,486
Yeah, no, that's,
um, that's helpful.

612
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:03,694
- And to work both the
buttocks, you hold.

613
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,523
Hello, delivery.

614
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,268
- sorry, I
thought I closed that.

615
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:22,379
- Nothing to apologise for.

616
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:24,715
- this is so unprofessional.

617
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:30,387
I feel ridiculous.

618
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:32,891
- Ridiculous?

619
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,560
Ridiculous like I can't
get you off my mind?

620
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:43,475
- You can't?

621
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:44,627
- No.

622
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,908
- Dinner at my
place Friday night?

623
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
- All right.

624
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:57,581
- Looks like our hour is up.

625
00:31:58,566 --> 00:31:59,750
- I think it is.

626
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:02,753
- Thanks for a great class.

627
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,434
You have an amazing
rest of your day.

628
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:20,270
- I will, you too.

629
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,870
- Hey, did you see the
draft of the mansion murder?

630
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:48,023
- Mansion murder, seriously?

631
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,531
- An "eyes wide
shut" theme party.

632
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:52,194
Where a local
entrepreneur was murdered.

633
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:53,762
- Yes, I get the angle,

634
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:56,698
But not for this one, okay?

635
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:57,717
- Okay.

636
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,292
Brian left behind two kids.

637
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,143
And a lot of grieving
family members and friends,

638
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:01,535
Many of whom I know personally,

639
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:03,286
So we're not gonna
sensationalise this one, okay?

640
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:06,799
Let's just publish information
confirmed by the police.

641
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,562
- Which I did, but I
will change the headline.

642
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:12,370
In the meantime, can
you take a look at it?

643
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:13,942
It's in the online
drafts folder.

644
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:14,807
- Yep.

645
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:15,827
Yeah, looking now.

646
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:17,887
Thanks.

647
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,412
Dale!

648
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,747
- what?

649
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,915
- What the hell is this?

650
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,250
- What do you mean?

651
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:33,575
- "sources close to
the investigation say.

652
00:33:33,587 --> 00:33:35,060
That Amelie Didot is
thought to have been.

653
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:37,239
In a romantic relationship
with the deceased.

654
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:38,740
Didot, a Canadian transplant.

655
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:41,040
"Is currently under investigation
for running a sex ring."

656
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:42,260
- Where does it say that?

657
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:44,069
- "out of her newly-established
Pilates studio."

658
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:45,247
- I didn't write that, boss.

659
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,513
- What do you mean
you didn't write it?

660
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,830
- I mean that I
didn't write that.

661
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:48,674
I've never seen
that photo before.

662
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:50,369
And I don't even
know who she is.

663
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:52,427
I think our system's
been hacked, pierce.

664
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,079
- Open your account
now and erase it.

665
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:55,914
We need it off the system
and change the pass-codes.

666
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:56,608
- I don't know how to
change the pass-code.

667
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,201
- Well, call Brody in tech.

668
00:33:58,353 --> 00:33:59,661
Do it now!

669
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,524
- I mean, are you doing okay?

670
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,284
- Yes and no.

671
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:09,954
I guess I just, I can't
believe it happened.

672
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:11,790
It seemed so unreal.

673
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:12,884
- I can imagine.

674
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:16,329
- Hey, I, I don't wanna
make you feel uneasy,

675
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:19,120
But you know that woman
that you were talking to.

676
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:21,116
After class the other day?

677
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:23,468
- Ooh, the oddball who
broke my picture frame.

678
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,211
And got ink all over my floor.

679
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:27,064
- She broke your picture frame?

680
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,171
- Yeah, she slammed it
down and smashed it.

681
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:30,716
It was so weird.

682
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,294
Maybe she was having a bad day.

683
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:35,054
- Okay, you cannot let
her back in your studio.

684
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:37,223
Or anywhere near
you for that matter.

685
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,242
- Why?

686
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:40,802
- Amelie, that was Pierce's ex.

687
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:42,654
Does pierce know
that she was there?

688
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:45,323
- No, she left the studio
before and he came.

689
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:47,142
- Good.

690
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,742
I am gonna give
you the same advice.

691
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,570
That pierce is gonna give you,

692
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,589
You need to keep
her away from you.

693
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:55,650
- How do you know her?

694
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:57,463
- I don't, I only
met her in passing.

695
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:58,901
She and pierce
were at the movies.

696
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:01,264
I guess they were on
their second date.

697
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,583
The following day, I get
a text message from her.

698
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,084
Asking if she wanted to meet up.

699
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:08,105
- Like, like out of the blue?

700
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:10,941
- Yeah, so I assumed that
pierce gave her my number.

701
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,168
And I felt obligated to
get together with her.

702
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:17,339
Anyway, we meet for lunch and
she seemed fantastic at first.

703
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:19,152
You know, she started
even telling me.

704
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:21,284
How sexually compatible
she and pierce were.

705
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:24,788
I did find it.

706
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:26,531
- Of course.

707
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,701
- And then she starts to dig,
like dig up stuff on pierce.

708
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:32,963
She even went as far as to ask
if he and I had ever dated.

709
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,806
She said, "I couldn't
help but notice.

710
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:46,459
How you kissed him on the
cheek the first time we met."

711
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:50,038
Uh-huh, and get this, next
time I run into pierce,

712
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:52,207
He told me he had
to break up with her.

713
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:54,145
Because she was becoming
excessively jealous.

714
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:56,878
To the point of being
obsessed with him.

715
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:59,305
He also shared with
me he had no idea.

716
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,640
That we got together for lunch.

717
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,159
Or how she even got my number.

718
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:07,647
I, I tell you what,
this is just crazy.

719
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,408
I, I saw her there that night.

720
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,836
I swear, I saw her.

721
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,988
By the time I got down to
see her, see if it was her,

722
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,340
She'd taken off into the crowd.

723
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,678
You know, I, I wasn't
worried about it at first,

724
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:26,257
But if that was her,
she noticed you.

725
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,592
- Noticed me?

726
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:30,002
- Why do you think she
came to your studio?

727
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,522
Listen, you have
got to be careful.

728
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:35,341
Ever since my party,

729
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,040
I am thinking the
worst of everyone.

730
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:43,867
Yeah, let's get out of here.

731
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:52,617
- yes, yes,

732
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,711
I'll see you tonight.

733
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,878
I'll see you at the studio.

734
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,214
- yeah, see you in class.

735
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,729
- hey you.

736
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:19,127
- Hey, what are you
doing over here?

737
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:21,813
- I was just driving
by, but you need a lift?

738
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,241
- Uh, no, no, nothing,

739
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:29,804
Um, but I'm, I'm good.

740
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:30,655
Thank you.

741
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:31,807
- Okay.

742
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,234
- Do you live around here?

743
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,329
- No, but my favourite pizza
joint does so, you know.

744
00:37:38,482 --> 00:37:40,148
- Right.

745
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,333
- Why don't you get in? I'll
totally give you a ride.

746
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,652
- I'm, I'm good, thanks.

747
00:37:44,746 --> 00:37:47,264
Actually, that's my car
share, but thank you.

748
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,163
- I'm literally offering
to save you some money,

749
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,010
Give you a ride.

750
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:53,162
It's not a big deal.

751
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:57,107
- Thanks, thanks, I'm good.

752
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:58,258
Another time.

753
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,095
- Whatever.

754
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:36,646
- Hi, it's Amelie, uh.

755
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,322
- Welcome to my humble abode.

756
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:53,121
- By humble abode you
mean lavish mansion?

757
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:54,999
- Tomato, tomato.

758
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,500
Certainly keeps the rain off.

759
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:04,415
You hungry?

760
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:05,733
- starving.

761
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:07,510
- That's good, kind
of went all out.

762
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:11,073
- thank you.

763
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,977
- My mother's recipe.

764
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:19,022
- Mm, yum.

765
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,933
- So have a confession.

766
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,342
I miss-gauged the cooking time.

767
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,678
So we have about half
an hour til dinner.

768
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:28,940
- Okay, well, how about a tour?

769
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:30,700
- Mm, but of course, madame.

770
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,037
Right this way.

771
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:57,227
Last, but not least.

772
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,716
- You've got to be kidding me.

773
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,476
- You don't have
pools in Montreal?

774
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,148
- They do, which is usually
a hole in the ground.

775
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,577
- How was your dinner with barb?

776
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,915
- It was nice.

777
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:22,919
Yeah, you were right,
she's just been rattled.

778
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,046
By the whole murder,
rightfully so.

779
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,763
She did tell me something
that she felt I should know.

780
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,990
- What's that?

781
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,917
- She cautioned
me about your ex.

782
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,327
- My ex?

783
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:40,345
- Fran.

784
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,460
You remember me telling
you about that woman.

785
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:49,170
That came into my studio and
smashed my picture of buster?

786
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:50,405
- She's been to your studio?

787
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:53,842
- Had a one-time class.

788
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,940
- Okay, there's something I
didn't share with you earlier.

789
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:01,941
I had to take a restraining
order out on her.

790
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:04,535
It's a first, trust me.

791
00:41:04,688 --> 00:41:06,629
That's alarming that
she came to your studio.

792
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,802
It's just too much
of a coincidence.

793
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:15,805
- You know, everyone takes
breakups differently.

794
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,535
This is embarrassing, but
I even Googled the woman.

795
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:22,386
That my ex-husband
is now seeing.

796
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,388
I looked her up on social media.

797
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:28,893
It's kind of normal to quasi
stock your ex's new girlfriend.

798
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,712
- This is different.

799
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:33,731
- All I'm saying is that
maybe she's just having.

800
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:34,883
A hard time letting go.

801
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,902
Just might take some time.

802
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:38,996
- I hope you're right.

803
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:41,331
- Let's change the subject.

804
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,242
- Yes, please, but
you must tell me.

805
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:45,474
If she comes back in there.

806
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:47,487
- Promise.

807
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:53,676
You swim often?

808
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:55,845
- Every day.

809
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:57,180
- Every day?

810
00:41:57,331 --> 00:42:00,183
- Every day, every
day but today.

811
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:04,504
- Oh, you're just,

812
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,114
You're gonna get
in right now, okay.

813
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:13,655
- No time on the present.

814
00:42:29,622 --> 00:42:31,455
Are you coming?

815
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:34,175
- How can I resist on

00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:59,200

Synchronised.

821
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:11,329
- Handstand master.

822
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:12,481
- Handstand master?

823
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:16,167

- That was good.

831
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:09,501
- Yeah, it wasn't quite as good.

832
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:11,235
As the chicken I
made you, but close.

833
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:15,151
- It's a good thing
your fire alarm is loud.

834
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:17,737
I've never seen anyone jump
out of the pool that fast.

835
00:44:19,232 --> 00:44:20,305
Let me help you clean up.

836
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,807
- Oh no, don't worry.

837
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,551
It's my favourite bit.

838
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:25,485
Seriously, I put a pod-cast
of Piketon massacre.

839
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:26,737
And away I go.

840
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,073
- Piketon massacre, what's that?

841
00:44:29,225 --> 00:44:31,585
- It's only the best true-crime
pod-cast there is right now.

842
00:44:31,728 --> 00:44:32,728
- Oh, really, okay.

843
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:37,899
Looks like your fire
alarm triggered something.

844
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:39,491
- that's a first.

845
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,235
- Burning a meal?

846
00:44:41,254 --> 00:44:44,013
- Yeah, that too, but never
triggered my fire alarm.

847
00:44:45,758 --> 00:44:47,006
- I just had a security
system put in my place, too.

848
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,409
- yeah?

849
00:44:48,502 --> 00:44:51,095
- Mm-hm, it was a freebie,

850
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,916
But I now feel like I'm
living the life of the elite.

851
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:56,859
- So that makes me elite?

852
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:03,533
- Have you seen my purse?

853
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
- Maybe over there?

854
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:06,619
- mm.

855
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:13,525
Oh my god.

856
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,119
- what's that?

857
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:19,290
- Well, it looks like a, a
pen exploded in my purse.

858
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,125
That's so weird.

859
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:24,369
- It's weird that a pen
exploded in your purse?

860
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,704
- No, it's just that,

861
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:28,474
Oh shoot, that is my ride share.

862
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:31,753
- You know I could
have given you a ride.

863
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:35,898
- I know, but that might
have led to something.

864
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:39,569
That we're not quite
ready for just yet.

865
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,407
- Mm-hm, true, but at the
expense of sounding cliche,

866
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:49,153
That was sincerely the best
evening I've had in years,

867
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,247
So thank you.

868
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,832
- It really was.

869
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:56,391
And thank you for
these warm clothes.

870
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:57,670
I will return them promptly.

871
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,344
- Don't forget my flip flops.

872
00:46:13,496 --> 00:46:14,496
- Those too.

873
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:32,271
Thanks, have a good night.

874
00:46:44,527 --> 00:46:45,527
Buster?

875
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:53,142
Bus!

876
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,645
Buster, where are you, buddy?

877
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:00,651
Buster?

878
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,488
Hi, there you are.

879
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:07,064
Hi.

880
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,158
Hi baby.

881
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:10,827
Why are you sticky?

882
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,979
Did you get into
something, b, hmm?

883
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:14,998
You want some dinner?

884
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,863
It's just the wind,
baby, just the wind.

885
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:30,681
There you go.

886
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,676
Poured orange soda
all over my car.

887
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,450
It was the stickiest
mess I ever had.

888
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,210
- 911, what's your emergency?

889
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:05,956
- Sorry, I didn't, I
didn't mean to call.

890
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:12,889
Come on buddy, let's go to bed.

891
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,056
Security assistance.

892
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:42,575
- Yes, hello, this
is pierce Dalton.

893
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:43,568
Over on eighth avenue.

894
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,995
- how can I help you?

895
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,090
- My security system
seems to be on fritz.

896
00:48:48,317 --> 00:48:49,473
- Let's check,
when did it begin?

897
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:51,093
- Yeah, it began last night.

898
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,931
- Sure, your system was
deactivated at 9:47 pm.

899
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:56,802
- What do you mean,
it's deactivated?

900
00:49:21,517 --> 00:49:24,201
- Amelie, I'm on the way. Lock
the doors and wait for me.

901
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,295
Do not open to anyone.

902
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:27,798
It's about Fran.

903
00:49:27,857 --> 00:49:29,039
See you in a minute.

904
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:50,821
- Hi.

905
00:49:53,382 --> 00:49:55,807
You mentioned you
had security cameras?

906
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,384
- yes.

907
00:49:57,478 --> 00:49:59,376
- And you can watch the
footage on your phone?

908
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:00,388
- Yeah.

909
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:03,741
- Fran?

910
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,743
- It's not activated.

911
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,503
- I forgot to do that.

912
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,323
There's something I
should have told you.

913
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,250
After I met with barb,
I was walking home,

914
00:50:13,402 --> 00:50:16,754
And Fran offered me a ride.

915
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,405
- She was following you?

916
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:20,172
- I didn't think it was
anything to worry about.

917
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,333
She had pizza.

918
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,834
She said she was in the area.

919
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:24,270
- She was in my home, Amelie.

920
00:50:26,673 --> 00:50:28,255
I saw her on the
security system today.

921
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:29,250
- Your security system?

922
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:30,693
- While you were there.

923
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:33,011
She had your purse, she
looked dead into camera,

924
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,854
She pulled a pin or
something out of her ear.

925
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,440
- It's a pen.

926
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,034
When she first came to my class,

927
00:50:38,261 --> 00:50:41,520
She had ink leaking
from her bag.

928
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,362
And I told her this story,
I know this sounds stupid,

929
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,208
But how I don't carry
pens in my purse anymore.

930
00:50:47,787 --> 00:50:49,035
And then I also
told her this story.

931
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:52,956
About how I spilled
orange soda in my car.

932
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,550
She's been here.

933
00:50:54,777 --> 00:50:56,944
Pierce, I, I know
this sounds nuts,

934
00:50:56,962 --> 00:50:58,842
But it's the only thing that makes sense.

935
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:00,205
- Back door?

936
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,863
- Yeah, I made sure that
was locked last night.

937
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,215
- But the front door, was
that open when you got back?

938
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,469
- Yes, but it slammed.

939
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:09,231
It was open and then shut,
like the wind, maybe.

940
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:12,903
There's more.

941
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,739
Barb told me she thinks
she saw Fran at the party.

942
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:19,658
She's not sure,
but she thinks so.

943
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,662
- She's following you, pierce.

944
00:51:25,975 --> 00:51:27,899
- She's following you, too.

945
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,901
This has got to stop.

946
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:31,253
- Who are you calling?

947
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:33,905
- Kip, lead investigator
on the case.

948
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,257
It is out of control.

949
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:39,002
It's going to voicemail.

950
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:41,097
Kip, it's pierce Dalton.

951
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:44,341
I need you to call me as
soon as you can, it's urgent.

952
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:51,349
You okay?

953
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,335
- I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

954
00:51:54,428 --> 00:51:56,028
- Let's get some fresh air.

955
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:04,528
You know, I grew up around here.

956
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,697
- Aren't you English?

957
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:09,350
- What gave that away?

958
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:10,793
No, my dad's an engineer.

959
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,820
Got hired by a tech
firm here in the us,

960
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:14,296
Moved when I was 10.

961
00:52:14,523 --> 00:52:15,863
- That must have
been a big change.

962
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:17,133
- Yeah, but a good one.

963
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,240
I really wasn't a fan
of the cold weather.

964
00:52:21,197 --> 00:52:25,224
Anyway, my brothers and sisters
used to swim in this ocean.

965
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,726
Back in the day it was great.

966
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,631
- In Montreal, it was just,
we lived right downtown,

967
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,650
So it was just
concrete city walks.

968
00:52:37,213 --> 00:52:39,321
Pierce. I'm scared.

969
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:42,658
- I blame myself for this.

970
00:52:44,737 --> 00:52:46,059
Getting you tangled
up in all this,

971
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:48,998
It's, you just met
me at a funny time.

972
00:52:50,242 --> 00:52:51,316
Is he okay?

973
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,410
- Come on, buster.

974
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,311
He's just not used to going
to the bathroom on the beach.

975
00:52:56,323 --> 00:52:57,656
- Oh, oh, he needs to pee?

976
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,249
- yeah.

977
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,741
- Yeah, I'll go, take
him to little boys' room.

978
00:53:00,753 --> 00:53:01,844
Come on, come on.

979
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:40,959
- hey.

980
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,125
- Hey.

981
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,220
- Uh, my head.

982
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,722
- hey, doc, she's up.

983
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,875
- Hello, Amelie, I'm Dr. Neifel.

984
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,228
We're happy to see you awake.

985
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:54,730
Do you know where you are?

986
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:56,974
- At the hospital?

987
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:59,068
- That's right, do you
know how you got here?

988
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:02,054
- I was hit.

989
00:54:03,299 --> 00:54:04,471
- I'm gonna flash a
light in your eyes.

990
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:06,214
It's gonna be a little
bit uncomfortable.

991
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:07,243
Just bear with me, okay?

992
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,914
Can I have you look to the left?

993
00:54:12,065 --> 00:54:13,065
And now to the right.

994
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,003
Great, how do you feel
about talking to the police?

995
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:20,988
They have some
questions for you.

996
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,240
- What kind of questions?

997
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,651
- Just some things
to jog your memory.

998
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,252
- You can use that button
there if you need me,

999
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,419
Just go ahead and
give it a push.

1000
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,655
- Thanks.

1001
00:54:28,674 --> 00:54:29,990
- Excuse me.

1002
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,326
- Um, listen, if,
I'm sure they can,

1003
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:33,352
If you're not up to it.

1004
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:36,330
- No, it's okay.

1005
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:37,848
- We're interested to recall.

1006
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:41,092
If you remember having a
conversation with the woman.

1007
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:44,262
The evening of your friend
Barbara Gershwin's party.

1008
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:46,105
Wondering if you
remember being approached.

1009
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,191
By a woman that you didn't know?

1010
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,618
- I don't know,

1011
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,270
I, I talked to a lot of
people I didn't know.

1012
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,290
I'm new to town.

1013
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:58,627
- Is there anyone or anything
that seemed peculiar?

1014
00:54:58,854 --> 00:55:00,774
Anything that you could
think of could help.

1015
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:09,471
- Is that your car?

1016
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:24,135
- I saw Fran running
from that room.

1017
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:28,139
She had a, a fire bolt earring.

1018
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:29,233
She came from the room.

1019
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:34,330
Pierce, the room I found Brian.

1020
00:55:39,395 --> 00:55:41,244
Don't hesitate to
call if he's too much.

1021
00:55:41,397 --> 00:55:42,838
- And interrupt a weekend away.

1022
00:55:43,065 --> 00:55:45,990
With that tall
glass of hunkiness?

1023
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,417
Not a chance.

1024
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,902
- ready?

1025
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:49,928
- let's do it.

1026
00:55:51,924 --> 00:55:54,424
- Oh, could you do me a favor
and toss this in the garbage?

1027
00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:55,777
I don't wanna sound the alarm,

1028
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:58,354
But maybe a mouse
has been around.

1029
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:00,253
I found a pile of
it in my bathroom.

1030
00:56:00,265 --> 00:56:01,915
And I don't know,

1031
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:03,182
Maybe the little critter
was trying to dig a hole.

1032
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,591
The property manager's
gonna send by.

1033
00:56:04,603 --> 00:56:06,511
The exterminator, though.

1034
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,364
Didn't your house get inspected?

1035
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:09,848
- No.

1036
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,850
- But if there's a
mouse in the house,

1037
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:12,776
Buster will find it, right?

1038
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,352
- Yes, he will.

1039
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:15,566
I'll throw this way for you.

1040
00:56:15,598 --> 00:56:17,706
- Okay, hill up girl, have fun.

1041
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:20,591
Just set it next to the
bin, I'll grab it later.

1042
00:56:20,603 --> 00:56:21,618
- Thank you, Margaret.

1043
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,035
Call if you need anything, okay?

1044
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,047
Anything at all.

1045
00:56:25,866 --> 00:56:26,607
- See you Margaret.

1046
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:27,625
- Bye now.

1047
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,572
- This place is a
little slice of heaven.

1048
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:54,076
- But if it's heaven,
then you must be an angel.

1049
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:56,307
- That was the cheesiest
thing you've ever said.

1050
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,230
- Couldn't resist.

1051
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:01,324
Yeah, my parents
discovered the keys.

1052
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:02,835
Right after we moved to Florida.

1053
00:57:04,313 --> 00:57:06,738
Settled in and they
bought this beach house,

1054
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,149
So I come here as much as I can.

1055
00:57:09,168 --> 00:57:10,168
- It's beautiful.

1056
00:57:13,656 --> 00:57:15,931
Hey, can I ask you something?

1057
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:17,082
- Anything?

1058
00:57:20,162 --> 00:57:22,438
- Why do you think Fran's
having a hard time letting go?

1059
00:57:22,665 --> 00:57:24,681
You said your first
couple dates were fun.

1060
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,275
- Yeah, they were fun.

1061
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:28,444
She was, she was fun.

1062
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:31,530
But then she wasn't.

1063
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:37,786
This is obsessive behaviour
and I'm not a psychologist.

1064
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:42,040
I can't begin to understand
how someone becomes this way.

1065
00:57:43,686 --> 00:57:45,526
I even felt bad for
her in the beginning,

1066
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,884
But now this is, it's
just gone on too long.

1067
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:52,015
I mean our whole relationship,
if we can call that,

1068
00:57:52,027 --> 00:57:53,376
Was just three weeks.

1069
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:54,960
Yeah, I knew her for
a year before that.

1070
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,714
She'd come and go from the
office, but I don't know,

1071
00:57:57,866 --> 00:58:00,124
I guess what I'm
trying to say is.

1072
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,811
It's just all a bit
unbelievable, really,

1073
00:58:03,038 --> 00:58:04,838
Getting tangled up
with someone like her.

1074
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:06,983
- Yeah.

1075
00:58:10,062 --> 00:58:11,403
- How's your head?

1076
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,463
- It hurts, but
it's getting better.

1077
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,975
- You hungry?

1078
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:17,994
- Getting there.

1079
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,834
This is so good.

1080
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:29,396
- It's never a bad time
in season for stone crab.

1081
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:30,822
- Unless you're a crab.

1082
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,252
Try that.

1083
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:36,512
- Mm.

1084
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:37,420
- Yeah?

1085
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:38,515
- Even better.

1086
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:40,591
- Does that work?

1087
00:58:43,003 --> 00:58:44,335
- Of course.

1088
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,437
- hm.

- Good morning.

1105
01:01:33,932 --> 01:01:35,023
- Good morning.

1106
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,511
- Oh my god, you're stunning.

1107
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:01,932
- I'm thinking of
going down to the beach.

1108
01:02:01,944 --> 01:02:03,443
And collecting some shells.

1109
01:02:03,462 --> 01:02:06,221
- Sounds good, maybe we
can go snorkeling later.

1110
01:02:06,448 --> 01:02:07,938
I'm sure we'll find
an empty conch shell.

1111
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:08,965
This time of the season.

1112
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:13,895
- Mm, I'd love that.

1113
01:02:14,881 --> 01:02:16,139
- God, I love your lips.

1114
01:02:28,987 --> 01:02:30,245
- Hey, hey, girl!

1115
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:34,991
Hey, beautiful day, right?

1116
01:02:35,143 --> 01:02:36,334
It's a little windy.

1117
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:42,174
Oh, I love seashells,
and dogs, too.

1118
01:02:46,412 --> 01:02:47,994
It's a shame so many
people complain about them.

1119
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:49,747
On the beach, am I right?

1120
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:51,415
I always had a cat growing up,

1121
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,500
So I never thought too
much about a dog, you know?

1122
01:02:53,512 --> 01:02:55,168
It's always this like
love/hate relationship

1123
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,180
I have with them.

1124
01:02:57,349 --> 01:02:59,257
But since we're all
about love recently,

1125
01:02:59,351 --> 01:03:00,525
I figured we'd go with that.

1126
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:03,428
So good to see you.

1127
01:03:05,857 --> 01:03:06,673
- Pierce!

1128
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:07,691
Pierce!

1129
01:03:11,271 --> 01:03:12,271
She's here!

1130
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,458
- Where?

1131
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:17,200
- She went that way.

1132
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,609
- where?

1133
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:20,349
- Yes, yes, she was
just right there.

1134
01:03:29,197 --> 01:03:30,305
- Pack our things up quick.

1135
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:32,412
Let's go back to the
city as soon possible.

1136
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:03,079
Amelie is texting
the address now.

1137
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,582
- Got it, I'll connect with
the local authorities now.

1138
01:04:05,734 --> 01:04:06,974
In meantime, you two stay safe.

1139
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:07,993
- Okay, thanks, kip.

1140
01:04:09,329 --> 01:04:12,347
- She texted, she locked
herself out of my place.

1141
01:04:12,498 --> 01:04:13,682
With buster inside?

1142
01:04:16,595 --> 01:04:18,353
- You left her a key, right?

1143
01:04:18,504 --> 01:04:21,523
- No, I, I didn't think she
would need to get into my place.

1144
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,529
- I am so sorry, sweetheart.

1145
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,440
I don't know how on god's sweet
planet I locked myself out.

1146
01:04:30,592 --> 01:04:31,925
- How did you even get it in?

1147
01:04:31,943 --> 01:04:34,094
- Well, the exterminator.

1148
01:04:34,112 --> 01:04:35,912
She said she needed
to check your place.

1149
01:04:37,115 --> 01:04:37,947
- Buster!

1150
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,041
Buster!

1151
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:43,453
Buster!

1152
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:45,278
Fran, outside, said
something about dogs.

1153
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,290
Ah!

1154
01:04:52,114 --> 01:04:53,388
Buster!

1155
01:04:53,615 --> 01:04:54,615
Baby.

1156
01:04:56,801 --> 01:04:59,135
- There you go,
baby, there you go.

1157
01:04:59,287 --> 01:05:01,062
It's okay, it's okay.

1158
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,467
- The thumb drive from
the security cameras.

1159
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:08,811
The night of the party?

1160
01:05:08,964 --> 01:05:09,964
How'd you get this?

1161
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,214
Barbara said she
turned off the system.

1162
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:15,059
For their people's privacy.

1163
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,960
- They did, but they
forgot about this one.

1164
01:05:16,972 --> 01:05:19,247
Because it only faces
the back lane way.

1165
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:21,147
I should have brought it to
you right away when I found it.

1166
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:23,084
- So it's the back
lane way's footage?

1167
01:05:23,236 --> 01:05:26,162
- And someone is seen running
out the back of the house.

1168
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,256
Fits the timeline.

1169
01:05:30,986 --> 01:05:32,168
- this will help.

1170
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,820
- Well, I bloody well hope so.

1171
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:36,264
Someone must have seen
her, know where she is.

1172
01:05:36,416 --> 01:05:38,174
- We think.

1173
01:05:38,326 --> 01:05:41,269
- Her computer, did we verify
that she hacked our system?

1174
01:05:41,496 --> 01:05:44,164
- Yes, we say it's a
work computer from work,

1175
01:05:44,182 --> 01:05:46,090
And her employer has
denied her access.

1176
01:05:46,184 --> 01:05:47,350
To all of her accounts.

1177
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,404
Unfortunately, we don't
have enough just yet.

1178
01:05:49,504 --> 01:05:51,112
To issue a warrant for her home,

1179
01:05:51,264 --> 01:05:55,533
But we put eyes out front,
and this should help.

1180
01:05:57,012 --> 01:05:58,861
I'm gonna head back
to the precinct now.

1181
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,697
She's dangerous, pierce.

1182
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:04,033
And worse, Amelie has
a target on her back.

1183
01:06:04,186 --> 01:06:05,426
We're gonna do the best we can,

1184
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,342
But you're gonna need
to look out for her.

1185
01:06:17,623 --> 01:06:18,974
- Strengthening your core.

1186
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:22,759
Nice, you really wanna
feel this in your abdomen.

1187
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,296
Good.

1188
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,773
Now one more pull.

1189
01:06:29,227 --> 01:06:30,318
That's it, one more.

1190
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,636
Nice job, ladies.

1191
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,805
Thank you for
another great class.

1192
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,425
Okay, I'll see you
guys next week.

1193
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,493
- ugh.

1194
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:40,258
- bye, have a good one.

1195
01:06:42,741 --> 01:06:43,814
Thanks for coming.

1196
01:06:43,908 --> 01:06:45,458
- Hey, are you okay?

1197
01:06:46,745 --> 01:06:47,651
- I'm fine.

1198
01:06:47,746 --> 01:06:48,986
- Did you have to get stitches?

1199
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:49,896
- Uh, just five.

1200
01:06:49,914 --> 01:06:51,172
- Just five?

1201
01:06:51,324 --> 01:06:53,004
- Yes, I'm taking
precautions, barb.

1202
01:06:53,068 --> 01:06:54,628
- Well, I just
have one question,

1203
01:06:55,661 --> 01:06:57,570
Is he really that good in bed?

1204
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:59,906
- way to make
light of the situation.

1205
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,332
- Well, it's a valid question.

1206
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,685
Oh, someone's ears
must have been burning.

1207
01:07:03,912 --> 01:07:04,912
- Hey barb.

1208
01:07:08,341 --> 01:07:10,007
- Hey, are you doing okay?

1209
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,832
- Yeah, I'll be better
when Fran's caught.

1210
01:07:11,844 --> 01:07:14,103
- Yeah, won't we all.

1211
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,197
Okay, I'm out of here.

1212
01:07:16,349 --> 01:07:17,505
You call me if
you need anything.

1213
01:07:17,517 --> 01:07:18,775
- I will, let me walk you out.

1214
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:20,702
- yeah, thanks.

1215
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:28,376
- Locking the
door, that's smart.

1216
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:33,106
- I just don't want any
more surprise visits.

1217
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:35,383
- Yeah, do you have a minute?

1218
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:37,886
- I just finished the last
of my class, so yeah, sure.

1219
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:41,723
Did something else happen?

1220
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:44,451
- No.

1221
01:07:54,145 --> 01:07:56,738
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

1222
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,800
- Excuse me?

1223
01:08:01,469 --> 01:08:05,729
- It's not, everything
I've said stands.

1224
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,064
- But?

1225
01:08:07,158 --> 01:08:09,066
- But this isn't healthy.

1226
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,993
- For you or for me?

1227
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:12,754
- Look at you, Amelie.

1228
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,590
This isn't safe anymore.

1229
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:23,490
- No.

1230
01:08:24,492 --> 01:08:25,492
- No?

1231
01:08:26,586 --> 01:08:28,226
- I'm not letting
her win, pierce.

1232
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:29,086
- This isn't about winning.

1233
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,563
- No, it's about control,

1234
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,759
And I refuse to let
Fran control me,

1235
01:08:35,854 --> 01:08:37,904
Or you for that matter.

1236
01:08:40,525 --> 01:08:44,452
I'm not even scared
anymore, pierce, I'm angry.

1237
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:05,623
Pierce, I can't help but believe.

1238
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,143
That we came into each
other's lives for a reason.

1239
01:09:10,538 --> 01:09:12,338
You've opened me up
in ways that I just,

1240
01:09:15,894 --> 01:09:16,985
I never thought possible.

1241
01:09:21,232 --> 01:09:22,548
And if we break up,

1242
01:09:22,567 --> 01:09:24,056
We're just giving her
exactly what she wants,

1243
01:09:24,068 --> 01:09:25,643
And when will that end?

1244
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:26,662
Pierce, it won't.

1245
01:09:33,728 --> 01:09:36,229
I'm not gonna lose you.

1246
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:40,750
- Are you sure?

1247
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,343
- Kiss me.

1248
01:10:26,798 --> 01:10:27,798
It's not coming off.

1249
01:10:29,617 --> 01:10:32,060
- Here, let me
have a go at that.

1250
01:10:40,128 --> 01:10:41,728
- I'll check the
security camera.

1251
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:45,573
Okay, it's just Margaret.

1252
01:10:49,487 --> 01:10:51,137
- Hi.
- Hi.

1253
01:10:51,155 --> 01:10:52,321
I hope I'm not disturbing.

1254
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,581
- Of course not.

1255
01:10:53,808 --> 01:10:55,808
- I made a lasagna
and I had extra.

1256
01:10:55,827 --> 01:10:56,993
Thought you might enjoy it.

1257
01:10:57,145 --> 01:10:59,069
- That's so thoughtful
of you, thank you.

1258
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:00,689
Wanna come in,
join us for dinner?

1259
01:11:02,317 --> 01:11:04,323
- I'd love to, but my
show starts in 10 minutes.

1260
01:11:04,335 --> 01:11:05,335
And it's the finale.

1261
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:07,487
- Mm, you can't miss the finale.

1262
01:11:07,505 --> 01:11:09,505
- I do this remote viewing
party with my sister.

1263
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:10,840
On the computer.

1264
01:11:10,992 --> 01:11:12,750
It's just kind our thing.

1265
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,259
- I'm gonna make a salad,
and we'll bring you a bowl.

1266
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:15,344
I'll text you.

1267
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,013
- No rush, sweetheart.

1268
01:11:17,165 --> 01:11:18,445
Bye bye.
- Bye.

1269
01:11:34,532 --> 01:11:35,532
I'm so excited.

1270
01:11:36,701 --> 01:11:37,701
It's gonna be good.

1271
01:11:40,538 --> 01:11:43,798
- different priorities,
different priorities.

1272
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:48,452
From the us.

1273
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,640
- There you are.

1274
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:53,215
Got your dinner ready?

1275
01:11:53,368 --> 01:11:55,868
- mm-hm, yes,
ma'am, warming it up now.

1276
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:56,967
- I'm doing the same thing.

1277
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,646
This is gonna be good.

1278
01:11:58,798 --> 01:12:00,056
I can't wait!

1279
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,110
- it's gonna
be great. I can't wait.

1280
01:12:03,302 --> 01:12:04,652
- Margaret, Margaret!

1281
01:12:12,554 --> 01:12:15,413
- There, okay, the
store on the corner.

1282
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,875
- You're looking for
something to clean the mirror?

1283
01:12:20,986 --> 01:12:23,062
- Yeah, it's just the
vinegar wasn't working.

1284
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:05,955
- Hey, I really think
you should go for a run.

1285
01:13:06,107 --> 01:13:09,366
- Yeah, I just don't think it's
a good idea leaving you here.

1286
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:10,776
By yourself right now.

1287
01:13:10,795 --> 01:13:12,294
- Hey, hey, I'll be okay, okay?

1288
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:13,946
You'll be quick.

1289
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:17,967
Plus, we need the glass cleaner,
so you can pick some up.

1290
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,143
- Are you sure?

1291
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,295
- I'm sure.

1292
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,554
- Lock the door.

1293
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,240
- I will, I will.

1294
01:13:55,414 --> 01:13:57,840
- Have you heard anything?

1295
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,435
- No, nothing yet, but the
locks have been changed.

1296
01:14:00,662 --> 01:14:02,603
And police are
monitoring Fran's house.

1297
01:14:02,755 --> 01:14:04,421
- You're not home
alone, are you?

1298
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:06,274
- No, pierce is here.

1299
01:14:06,425 --> 01:14:07,850
- Man of the hour.

1300
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:11,187
Now when you say he's
there, he's there, there?

1301
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:13,856
- Technically, no, but
he'll be back soon.

1302
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:40,298
- why are you doing this to me?

1303
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,310
- Whoa, Fran!

1304
01:14:43,705 --> 01:14:45,538
- You said that you love me.

1305
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,873
- Okay, we've been
over this, okay?

1306
01:14:47,892 --> 01:14:50,376
- You said that you love
the way that I touched you.

1307
01:14:50,394 --> 01:14:53,395
- No, I love nothing about you.

1308
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:54,972
Let me be crystal clear on that.

1309
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:57,158
- She is a whore, pierce,

1310
01:14:57,309 --> 01:14:58,949
And I see the way
she touches you,

1311
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,226
And she thinks that
no one's watching me,

1312
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:01,329
And guess what?

1313
01:15:01,556 --> 01:15:02,813
Guess what?

1314
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,724
I've been watching
this whole time.

1315
01:15:04,817 --> 01:15:07,668
And everything she
does infuriates me,

1316
01:15:07,895 --> 01:15:10,153
And everything you
do infuriates me.

1317
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:12,081
- You need to stop this.

1318
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,232
Stop it.

1319
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:16,344
- You make me so angry, pierce.

1320
01:15:16,571 --> 01:15:17,678
It's like I see red.

1321
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:20,014
You do this to me!
- You need to calm down.

1322
01:15:20,241 --> 01:15:22,258
- You do this to me!
- Calm down!

1323
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:23,518
Calm down, okay?

1324
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,688
- I thought it was you.

1325
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:29,750
- Brian?

1326
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,425
- He dressed like you,
he, he looked like you,

1327
01:15:33,437 --> 01:15:34,937
He even smelled like you.

1328
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,031
- Were you...

1329
01:15:38,426 --> 01:15:40,760
- He took his hands
down my pants.

1330
01:15:40,853 --> 01:15:42,418
- Well, so what,
so you killed him?

1331
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,788
- Yes, I killed him.

1332
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,208
I didn't have a choice.

1333
01:15:47,435 --> 01:15:48,682
Because you weren't
there to protect me.

1334
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:51,045
- Okay, I'm gonna
walk away right now.

1335
01:15:52,623 --> 01:15:53,864
Don't you dare follow me.

1336
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,523
- Do not walk away
from me, pierce.

1337
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,387
- What are you doing?

1338
01:15:59,538 --> 01:16:02,557
- If I can't have
you, no one will.

1339
01:16:02,784 --> 01:16:04,374
She cannot have you!

1340
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:09,898
- Stop, stop!

1341
01:16:09,974 --> 01:16:11,807
- Help!
- Stop!

1342
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:12,959
- hey!

1343
01:16:12,977 --> 01:16:13,884
- Help, he's got a knife!

1344
01:16:13,978 --> 01:16:14,810
He's got a knife!

1345
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:15,904
- stop!

1346
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:21,742
- Get off of me!

1347
01:16:21,969 --> 01:16:23,319
- hold still!

1348
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:24,579
- She's wanted by the police!

1349
01:16:24,806 --> 01:16:26,488
- Stop fighting me.

1350
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:08,939
- Yeah, I'm at the park,
at the corner of fifth.

1351
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:12,126
I'm holding down a white
male, approximately six one.

1352
01:17:12,277 --> 01:17:14,203
He just attacked a
woman with a knife.

1353
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,297
- Fran gibbons, Fran gibbons.

1354
01:17:16,524 --> 01:17:18,374
Just tell them the
woman is Fran gibbons.

1355
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:20,209
- Send an officer now, please.

1356
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:21,861
- Tell them!

1357
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:38,217
Hi, this is Margaret.

1358
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:39,895
Please leave a message.

1359
01:17:44,402 --> 01:17:44,992
- I really loved.

1360
01:17:45,219 --> 01:17:45,976
- Margaret?

1361
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:46,810
- incredibly supportive,

1362
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,237
We gotta find somebody.

1363
01:17:48,389 --> 01:17:50,239
That's gonna put up
with your stupidity.

1364
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:51,891
- Margaret!

1365
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:53,991
- and really help
you accomplish your dreams.

1366
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,819
- Margaret, I have your salad!

1367
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,655
- never thought you'd
be able to accomplish.

1368
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:09,758
Margaret!

1369
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:10,592
Where are you?

1370
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,169
Are you okay?

1371
01:18:14,173 --> 01:18:15,829
- I thought you'd
be able to accomplish,

1372
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:19,585
And even the short time
we've spent together.

1373
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,356
- Oh my god, Margaret!

1374
01:18:33,451 --> 01:18:35,876
Margaret, oh my
god, what happened?

1375
01:18:36,103 --> 01:18:37,201
- She had some stuff
that knocked me out.

1376
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,361
So just leave me here.

1377
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:39,381
- Go, go now.

1378
01:18:41,776 --> 01:18:44,126
- even the short
time we together.

1383
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:31,647
- Amelie, I need
you to lock the doors.

1384
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:34,268
And get into a safe location.

1385
01:19:34,419 --> 01:19:35,936
- Where would that be?

1386
01:19:36,088 --> 01:19:37,669
- I have reason to
believe you are in harms way.

1387
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:39,256
Please, just do what I say.

1388
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,350

1390
01:19:43,687 --> 01:19:45,504
Amelie!

1391
01:19:45,523 --> 01:19:49,266
- come on, buster,
come here baby, come on.

1392
01:20:38,483 --> 01:20:42,503
- I know who you
are, I know what you do.

1393
01:20:42,654 --> 01:20:44,897
- You don't know
anything about me.

1394
01:20:44,915 --> 01:20:47,341
- You are a stupid whore.

1395
01:20:47,568 --> 01:20:49,159
- I'm not.

1396
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,254
- Exactly what my father
used to call women like you.

1397
01:20:52,406 --> 01:20:53,422
- I'm not.

1398
01:20:53,574 --> 01:20:56,241
Fran, I promise you I'm not.

1399
01:20:56,335 --> 01:20:58,055
- Did he tell you
how perfect we were,

1400
01:20:58,079 --> 01:20:59,244
Did he tell you that?

1401
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:00,855
- Fran, he did.

1402
01:21:01,006 --> 01:21:05,175
- He told me and all these
women just kept interfering.

1403
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,450
And I know I was
so good to be true.

1404
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:13,759
Everyone just kept telling
him lies and lies about me.

1405
01:21:13,852 --> 01:21:15,928
- I don't think
that's what happened.

1406
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:17,112
- Shut up!

1407
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,113
That is what happened!

1408
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,099
I know what happened!

1409
01:21:20,117 --> 01:21:22,710
- This needs to end, Fran.

1410
01:21:24,438 --> 01:21:27,773
- You can't keep
living like this, okay?

1411
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:29,291
I'll help you, I promise.

1412
01:21:29,443 --> 01:21:31,460
I promise I'll help you.

1413
01:21:31,612 --> 01:21:32,612
- You took him from me.

1414
01:21:34,465 --> 01:21:38,225
- He's not a possession,
Fran, he's a person.

1415
01:21:38,377 --> 01:21:39,284
- person?

1416
01:21:39,303 --> 01:21:40,060
- He's an ordinary person.

1417
01:21:40,287 --> 01:21:41,287
- He's mine!

1418
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:42,380
He's mine!

1419
01:21:43,382 --> 01:21:44,382
He's mine!

1420
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:55,970
- Amelie!

1421
01:22:58,215 --> 01:23:00,457
What did you do, Fran, huh?

1422
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:01,867
What did you do?

1423
01:23:01,885 --> 01:23:04,553
- She was trying, she
was trying to kill me.

1424
01:23:04,705 --> 01:23:06,647
I'm a victim here, not her.

1425
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,484
I'm the victim!

1426
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,325
Don't you see
everything I did for us?

1427
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:25,332
- Fran, get your hands up
and your knees on the ground.

1428
01:23:26,744 --> 01:23:27,744
Hands up, I said!

1429
01:23:29,897 --> 01:23:31,630
Get an ambulance, quick!

1430
01:23:36,253 --> 01:23:38,587
It's over, Fran, it's over.

1431
01:23:38,739 --> 01:23:40,139
- I did this for us.

1432
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,833
- Amelie!

1433
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,599
- pierce, get her up here!

1434
01:23:50,751 --> 01:23:51,751
Help is on the way.

1435
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:55,696
- I did all all of this for us!

1436
01:23:55,923 --> 01:23:59,033
- Fran gibbons, you are
arrested for the murder.

1437
01:23:59,184 --> 01:24:00,850
Of Brian fletcher.

1438
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:01,777
You have the right
to remain silent.

1439
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:03,445
- You did this to me!

1440
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,420
- Whatever you say can and
will be used against you.

1441
01:24:05,432 --> 01:24:06,856
In the court of law.

1442
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:08,691
You have the right
to an attorney.

1443
01:24:30,307 --> 01:24:32,549
- Pushing those
legs out, very nice.

1444
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,050
Make sure the small of your back.

1445
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,477
Is really tucked into the mat.

1446
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:37,387
Nice job, two more.

1447
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,889
- Oh my god, I'm going to die!

1448
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:42,910
Uh, Pilates-style
speaking, that is.

1449
01:24:44,471 --> 01:24:47,206
- Great going, great
job, and that's it.

1450
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,566
Nice job today.

1451
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:50,816
Thanks for another
fantastic class.

1452
01:24:50,828 --> 01:24:52,508
I will see you guys
next week, okay?

1453
01:24:53,647 --> 01:24:54,755
Good job today, bye.

1454
01:24:57,318 --> 01:25:00,928
- Ah, you're not gonna
keep that there, are you?

1455
01:25:01,155 --> 01:25:03,505
- No, no, just until
we finish moving in.

1456
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,991
- Moving in, it's a big step.

1457
01:25:06,084 --> 01:25:07,084
- Sure is.

1458
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:09,494
- Oh, look at you, swooshin' in.

1459
01:25:09,513 --> 01:25:12,848
And snatchin' up the city's
most eligible bachelor.

1460
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,516
- Not without a fight, barb.

1461
01:25:14,668 --> 01:25:15,758
- Well, that is true.

1462
01:25:17,762 --> 01:25:22,674
- Mm, would it be
highly inappropriate.

1463
01:25:22,693 --> 01:25:24,860
If I were to request a
private Pilates class.

1464
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:26,912
With you and him?

1465
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,916
- Considering that it's
called a private, maybe.

1466
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:34,035
- Oh, please, pierce,

1467
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,113
Don't feel the need to put
a shirt on on my account.

1468
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,133
- Putting it on because
that one's dirty.

1469
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:41,635
- Mm, he's cheeky.

1470
01:25:41,786 --> 01:25:43,262
- Okay, bye, barb.

1471
01:25:45,048 --> 01:25:48,625
- Okay, okay, never know,

1472
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,386
I might sign up for my own
lesson some day.

1473
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,463
- Bye!
- Bye!

1474
01:25:54,799 --> 01:25:56,391
- How did he do?

1475
01:25:56,543 --> 01:25:59,135
- Great, stopped every five
seconds to pee on a flower,

1476
01:25:59,229 --> 01:26:01,488
But otherwise a runner.

1477
01:26:03,808 --> 01:26:05,528
- I think I prefer
you without that.

1478
01:26:07,145 --> 01:26:08,145
- Mm, okay.

1479
01:26:09,406 --> 01:26:11,981
If you're finished with
your classes for today.

1480
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:14,393
- I just have one more private.

1481
01:26:14,411 --> 01:26:18,246
That I'm super excited for.

1482
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:20,916
This really hot client that
I can't stop thinking about.

1483
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:21,675
- Is that so?

1484
01:26:21,902 --> 01:26:23,010
- Mm-hm.

1486
01:26:27,574 --> 01:26:29,165
