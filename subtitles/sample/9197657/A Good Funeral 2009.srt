156
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:32,018
THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING,

157
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:35,054
Bret: WHAT ICEBERG?

158
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:38,724

175
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,921
DID I GET ANY HELP?
NO.

176
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:30,823

THEIR WEDDING?

177
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,658
I HAVE A CANCER.

178
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,061
MELANOMA.

179
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:47,133
I HAVE THIS.

180
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,835
I DRINK THIS
FOUR TIMES A DAY.

181
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,270
MY DAMN HAIR
HAS STARTED TO--

182
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:55,172
OH, MY GOSH, DAD--
I'M SORRY, LITTLE GIRL,

183
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:58,007
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SPRING IT
ON YOU ON YOUR BIG DAY.

184
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,742
NO, IT'S OKAY, BUT--
HOW DO YOU TAKE ANY OCCASION
AND MAKE IT
ALL
 ABOUT YOU?

185
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,679
MOM. HE COULD DIE.
WE ALL DIE.

186
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,379
HE IS GOING UPHILL.

187
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:11,682
HE LET IT GO TOO LONG,
AND--AND NOW IT'S LATE,

188
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:14,384
AND HE'S GOING UPHILL.
UPHILL BATTLE, MAUDIE.

189
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,319
BATTLE?
IT
IS
 A BATTLE,

190
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:20,055
UPHILL BATTLE,
AND WE ARE FIGHTING IT.

191
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,388
FIGHTING IT UPHILL.

192
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,791
WHAT DO YOU SAY, KIDS?

193
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,959
ONE WEEK IN THE MOTORHOME

194
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,961

195
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:35,731

I TOLD HIM IT WAS MY LAST CHANCE
TO GO ON SUMMER VACATION
WITH MY LOVING FAMILY.

207
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,907
JUNIOR,

208
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,942
I NEED TO TINKLE AGAIN.

209
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:54,715
( sighs )

210
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,262
UHH!

211
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,263
OH, MY GOD!

212
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:23,300
UHH!
( laughter )

213
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:29,771
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'D LET ME
USE THE TOILET IN THE CAMPER...

214
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:32,873
NO ONE FOULS

215
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:34,073

216
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:25,807
ALL RIGHT!

217
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,008
( cheers, applause )

218
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:36,281
ALL RIGHT, TURN IT ON.

219
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:41,184
UH...

220
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,752
KIDS, THERE'S SOMETHING,
UM...

221
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:50,489
WELL, MY DAD, UH...

222
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:53,324
THERE'S SOMETHING
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
BEFORE NOW,

223
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:57,326
BEFORE WE TURN ON
THE ROADSHOW. UH....

224
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,462
GRANDPA--WELL,

225
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:02,097
HIM AND GRAM,
LAST YEAR,

226
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,065
LAST, UM...OCTOBER,

227
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:07,967
THEY WERE OUT
ON UPPER LAKES HIGHWAY,

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,169
UP NEAR CURSON CREEK THERE,
AND, UH...

229
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:15,505
THEY'D BEEN FISHIN',
AND, UH, DAD, UM--

230
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,807
I THINK THEY'D HAD A GOOD DAY,
AND DAD, UH...

231
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:23,210
BOY, YOU KNOW,
ANYTIME YOU WENT FISHIN'
WITH DAD, YOU WERE SURE--

232
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:26,345
A TRAILER TRUCK HIT THEM.

233
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:29,214
DEAD. INSTANTLY.

234
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:32,082
IT'S LUCKY, IF YOU--
IF YOU ASK ME.

235
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,884
IT TOOK BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER...

236
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,485
LIKE THAT.

237
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:40,187
THE FISH WERE LYING THERE
RIGHT NEXT TO 'EM,

238
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,855
GOOD AS DAY, AND--

239
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:45,958
WE ENDED UP GIVING THE FISH
TO THE PATROLMEN...

240
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,492
SOME--

241
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:52,262
IT'S A SHAME
TO WASTE GOOD TROUT.

242
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,934
SORRY, DAD.

243
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,369
UH...YEAH.

244
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:14,142
YA KNOW, IT'S ALMOST EIGHT,
SO...

245
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:17,078
OH. YEAH, IT'S...

246
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:21,614
WELL, DRUM ROLL, PLEASE.
OH, YEAH.

247
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,882
( plays drum roll
with hands )

248
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,851
I THOUGHT YOU
LIKED MY COOKING1

249
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:30,019
YOU HAD A THOUGHT?
UNHHHH!

250
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:31,953
( clears throat )
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS
ANYTHING UNDER

251
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,622
THAT LITTLE BARBIE DOLL
HAIR-DO OF YOURS!

252
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:37,056
WHOA, LOOK!
ECHO! ECHO! ECHO!

253
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,393
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHAVE IT ALL OFF
AND GET YOURSELF A MOHAWK?

254
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:43,061
THAT WAY IT'LL DRAW ATTENTION
AWAY FROM YOUR NOSE!

255
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:46,863
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M PUTTING YOUR PHONES
IN ORBIT, THAT'S WHAT!

256
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,931
( laughter, applause )

257
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,368
( campfire crackling )

258
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:19,017
YEAH, I'M SORRY
ABOUT GRAMPS, DAD.

259
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:26,122
I'LL BET THERE'S FISHIN'
OUT HERE.

260
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:29,123
I'LL BET GRAMPS
WOULD HAVE...

261
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:31,126
I BET HE WOULD.

262
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,398
NO, NO. I'M FINE.

263
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:44,266
I MEAN, THAT IS
A NICE MOTORHOME, DAD.

264
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,402
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT IT WITH A TV.

265
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:49,303
I MEAN, THAT MUST HAVE
COST YOU--

266
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:51,938
WOULDN'T MIND SEEIN' YOU
ON THAT.

267
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:53,339
SEEING ME ON...?

268
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,608
ON TV.

269
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:58,643
ON TELEVISION.

270
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:00,311
UH...

271
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:03,379
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE FACES.

272
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:06,914
I GOT ONE OF THOSE FACES?
YEAH.

273
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:09,249
OH, YOU'D...

274
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:11,450
YOU'D STAND OUT ON TV.

275
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:13,586
YOU'RE CRAZY, DAD.

276
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,054
WELL, WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO HOLLYWOOD.

277
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:21,325
HOLLYWOOD? WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO DISNEYLAND. ( laughs )

278
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:23,959
HOLLYWOOD. ( laughs )

279
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:29,462
( laughs )

280
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:33,298
YOU THINK I GOT
ONE OF THOSE FACES?
THE FAMOUS KIND?

281
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,501
( both laugh )

282
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:00,916
YOU COMFY,
LITTLE GIRL?

283
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:05,585
I'M NOT
YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

284
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,955
AH. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
MY LITTLE GIRL,

285
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,090
NO MATTER WHAT.

286
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:15,130
( Andrew, indistinct;
both chuckle )

287
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:18,465
WHY DID YOU LOOK AT
THE CAMPER'S REGISTRATION?

288
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,433
BECAUSE MY DAD
WAS A HUSTLER.
A HUSTLER.

289
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:24,435
SERIOUSLY. I NEVER SAW HIM
BUY A BRAND-NEW ANYTHING,

290
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:27,271
CAR, PAIR OF PANTS,
LOAF OF BREAD...

291
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:29,439
( laughs )
LOAF OF BREAD?

292
00:24:29,472 --> 00:24:32,141
ALL RIGHT, BUT, YOU KNOW,

293
00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:34,709
GRAMPS DIES, AND SUDDENLY MY DAD
HAD A BRAND-NEW MOTORHOME.

294
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:38,245
TWO PLUS TO EQUALS FOUR,
RIGHT?
BINGO.

295
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,148
YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER
USED TO, UH...

296
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:48,551
SHE CALLED ME EVERY DAY.
I HATED IT.

297
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:52,287
I WISHED SHE'D JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE, YA KNOW?

298
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:58,291
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT SO SURE,
ARE YOU?

299
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:07,096
MAYBE YOU HAVE MORE IN COMMON
WITH STAN THAN YOU THOUGHT.

300
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,167
I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

301
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,036
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

302
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,104
YES, YOU DID.

303
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:20,672
IT
IS
 ELEVEN A.M.

304
00:25:20,706 --> 00:25:24,474
I ONLY DRINK ON WEEKENDS.
IT'S TUESDAY.

305
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:28,043
WELL, AT LEAST I'M NOT
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP
WITH A MARBLE WALL.

306
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:36,282
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.
THE PRIEST IS PROBABLY DONE.

307
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,483
GREET THE PEOPLE
THAT CAME FOR THE BURIAL,
YA KNOW?

308
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:42,519
WHY'D YOU COME TO IDAHO?

309
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:45,722
REAL ESTATE'S
A LITTLE SLOW RIGHT NOW.
NO, SERIOUSLY.

310
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:47,456
TO BURY MY DAD.

311
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,657
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND
IN THIRTY YEARS.

312
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,159
WELL, SOMEONE NEEDED TO DO IT,
AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS FISHING.

313
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:56,828
MY MOM...

314
00:25:56,861 --> 00:26:00,063
UM...

315
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:02,698
MY MOM WANTED HER ASHES
SCATTERED

316
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:06,235
FROM THE TOP OF
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

317
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,439
BUT HERE WE ARE.

318
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,443
I LIKE THAT IDEA.

319
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:26,847
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I'M SELFISH, TOO?

320
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:34,386
( ironic chuckle )
MAYBE I AM.

321
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:42,190
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
HERE FOR YOUR DAD, JUNIOR.

322
00:26:45,192 --> 00:26:49,161
GOOD. BECAUSE I NEVER DID
KNOW WHAT HE WANTED.

323
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:08,141
Stan:
MORNIN', LITTLE GIRL!

324
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:09,775
MORNING.

325
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:15,145
AHH.

326
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:18,414
HEY, DAD, WAS THIS
GRAMP'S CAMPER?

327
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,216
IT'S A MOTORHOME.

328
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,718
WHY DID YOU LIE?

329
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:34,390
I'M HAPPY
YOU'RE ALL HERE--
WITH ME-- THAT'S WHY.

330
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:36,525
BUT--
ARE YOU HAPPY, JUNIOR?

331
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,660
WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE WITH--
WHAT IS IT--?

332
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:42,262
HOWARD?
YEAH, HOWARD,
RIGHT.

333
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,366
( sighs ) YEAH.

334
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,201
YOU KNOW, THE CREEK
CLOSEST TO THE ROAD

335
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:52,436
DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE
THE BIGGEST FISH.

336
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,671
IS MOM THE FISH?

337
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:57,539
HOWARD
 IS THE FISH,
 JUNIOR.

338
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,140
YOU ONLY MET HIM ONCE,
DAD.

339
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:03,810
HEY, JUST DON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE.

340
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:05,844
OH.

341
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:09,579
SO I SHOULDN'T GET
MY GIRLFRIEND PREGNANT
AT EIGHTEEN.

342
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:11,581
WE
WANTED
 THIS BABY.

343
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:13,882
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

344
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:17,351
Bret: WHAT?
Polly: DID YOU TELL HER?

345
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,438
OH, JESUS CHRIST, MAUDE!

346
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:51,307
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE,
WITH YOUR HIP?!

347
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,608
NO, NO, IT DOESN'T GO THAT WAY.
NO. NO.

348
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:56,343
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.

349
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,478
ALL RIGHT, HANG ON.

350
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,715
( door opens )

351
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:15,355
HE LIKES TO BE 
IN CHARGE, HUH?

352
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:17,590
SOMETHING'S BURNING,
HONEY.

353
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:27,830
NO, NO.
DON'T TOUCH THE OVEN.

354
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:30,198
STAN'S RULES.

355
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:38,770
DAD, HOW--
HOW WOULD YOU GET ON TV?

356
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,741
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, BART.

357
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:48,476
HOW DO YOU THINK
I PAID FOR THIS CAMPER?

358
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,879
YOU ROBBED A BANK
WITH PATTY HEARST.
I KNOW.

359
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:55,348
( laughs )
WHAT?

360
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:57,182
YEAH! YEAH.

361
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,584
NO. SERIOUSLY?

362
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,821
THE MATCH GAME.

363
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,492
HE CAN BE MEAN
SOMETIMES.

364
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:15,661
WELL, IF YOU, UM,

365
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:19,496
IF YOU WANT A CAKE,
YOU GOTTA BE WILLING
TO GRIND UP THE WHEAT.

366
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:26,534
IS DAD THE CAKE?

367
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:30,637
YOU, STAN TALMADGE,
WERE ON TV WHEN?

368
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,638
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

369
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:34,605
YOU SHOULDA SEEN ME.
I WASN'T BAD.

370
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:37,240
YOU'RE SERIOUS? WAIT, WAIT,
POLLY MUST HAVE SEEN YOU.

371
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:38,742
SHE WATCHES THAT SHIT
LIKE EVERY DAY.

372
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:40,476
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S BEEN ON THE AIR YET.

373
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:42,811
THEY TAPE THOSE SHOWS,
LIKE, WAY AHEAD OF TIME.

374
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:46,347
"TAPE"? "TAPE"!
HA HA HA!

375
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,515

KIDS, LET'S GET ON

RIGHT, DAD.

378
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:15,966
HEY, DAD.
WHEN WE GET TO L.A.,

379
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,367
DO YOU THINK WE COULD
MAYBE TALK TO SOMEONE?

380
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:21,369
ABOUT TV. I MEAN,
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE?

381
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:23,537
WELL, YEAH, SURE, SON,

382
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:25,705
REALLY?
YOU KNOW, BART,

383
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:29,840
HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED THE SHOW
WHERE THE FAMILY IS A TEAM

384
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:32,643
AND THEY COMPETE
AGAINST EACH OTHER?

385
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,778
YOU MEAN
BEAT YOUR NEIGHBOR?

386
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,613
YEAH. YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YOU EVER SEEN THAT?

387
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,748
OH, MY GOD, OF COURSE!

IT'S FIVE, RIGHT?

388
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:42,983

389
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:49,019
( camera shutter clicks )

390
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:52,822
MAUDE, WILL YOU
TAKE ONE OF US?

391
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:03,963
OKAY. READY?

392
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:13,369
KIDS, UH,
LET'S GET ON THE ROAD.

393
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:14,636
OKAY.

394
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,437
BART, YOU DRIVE.

395
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,839
TIME FOR MY MEDICINE.

396
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:21,841
POLLY,
DON'T YOU WATCH
MATCH GAME?

397
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:24,309
Polly: IS JESUS
MY PERSONAL SAVIOR?

398
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:27,011
WHY IS IT THAT
YOU HAVE TO BRING JESUS
INTO
EVERYTHING?

399
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:29,746
( overlapping,
indistinct chatter )

400
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,320
ONWARD, BART, GOING WHERE
NO TALMADGE HAS GONE BEFORE.

401
00:32:41,354 --> 00:32:42,988
THAT'S RIGHT.
( palms slap )

402
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:11,906

on radio )

403
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:16,377

404
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,346
( burps )

405
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:41,625
HEY, BUD.

406
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:43,827
LOOK AT ME AND BRET.

407
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:47,529
DON'T YOU THINK WE LOOK LIKE
THOSE GUYS ON TV?
LIKE THE TV STARS?

408
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:52,699
WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DO,
STAN?

409
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,869
STAN USED TO MANAGE
THE MEAT DEPARTMENT

410
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,870
AT THE ALBERTSON'S
IN TWIN FALLS.

411
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:01,938
USED TO?

412
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,640
WELL, I GOT
OTHER PLANS NOW, BUD.

413
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:09,877
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NAMED
AFTER THE MAVERICK BROTHERS.
HE'S BRET, I'M BART...

414
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,478
OUR DAD NAMED US
AFTER THOSE GUYS.

415
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:13,979
DAD,
YOU STOPPED WORKING?

416
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:16,747
HOW MUCH FOR

417
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:19,449
( burps )
JEALOUS?
( chuckles )

418
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:21,784
HE WON IT

419
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,085

420
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:25,553
MATCH GAME.

421
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,458
HUH. I THOUGHT

422
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:34,526
TO TRY OUT FOR THAT
BEAT YOUR NEIGHBOR

423
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,627

 I TOLD YOU THAT.

426
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,497
YOU GOT A TV

427
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:44,632
DAD--
WHAT DO YOU GOT,
BLACK AND WHITE, OR COLOR?

428
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,400
COLOR.
WAIT A MINUTE.

429
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:48,635
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

430
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:50,669
MAUDE, ARE YOU
MAKING ALL THIS UP?

431
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:52,738
DAD, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

432
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:55,873
HOW ABOUT YOU JUST RELAX?
WE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

433
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:58,775
WE GOT THE RIGHT NUMBER
AND EVERYTHING.
AND DAD KNOWS SOMEBODY.

434
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:03,511
WHEN WE GO TO L.A.,
WE ARE GOING TO AUDITION
FOR BEAT...

435
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:06,779

437
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:13,417
BUD, HELP ME.
MY FAMILY'S CRAZY,

438
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:15,985
WELL, WE SHOULD REALLY
GET GOIN', HON.

439
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,755

444
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:31,096
I'M THE ONE
THAT MADE DINNER!

445
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,963
GOD, DOESN'T ANYBODY
LISTEN TO ME?

446
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,831
SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

447
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:36,431
Y'ALL COME BACK NOW,
YA HEAR?

448
00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:38,734
JESUS LISTENS, JUNIOR.

449
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,434
OHH!

450
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:06,119
WHY DID HE LIE TO ME?

451
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:12,689
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THIS CANCER STUFF REALLY
MESSES WITH YOU.

452
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:15,557
GOD, I CAN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

453
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,125
IT SCARES ME.

454
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,994
IT'S JUST THAT...

455
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:25,663
I'M JUST STARTING TO
GET TO KNOW DAD AGAIN.

456
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:28,599
SO LET'S GO DO
BEAT YOUR NEIGHBOR

457
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:30,600
AS A FAMILY.

458
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:33,035
I FEEL BAD FOR MOM.

459
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,737
WELL, WITH ALL
THE AMAZING THINGS
THAT I'M SURE

460
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,506
ARE GOING ON IN MAUDE'S HEAD,
I REALLY DON'T THINK SHE CARES.

461
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:41,573
AND IT'LL BE FUN
TO BE ON TV, JUNIOR.

462
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:43,809
YOU REMEMBER FUN,

463
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:45,643

464
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:47,577
AND IF DAD CAN GET US

465
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:49,845
ON TV, THAT WOULD BE COOL.

466
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:53,947
IT'LL BE...

467
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:57,151
THE ONLY THING
HE'S EVER DONE RIGHT
OUR WHOLE LIVES.

468
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:12,727

469
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,662

475
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,704
YOU SHOULD TAKE GEOGRAPHY
NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT THE CAMPER.

476
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:33,174
CAMPERS ARE PICK-UPS.
MOTORHOMES ARE COACHES.

477
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:35,775
IS HAS CAPTAIN'S CHAIRS.
IT HAS CAPTAIN'S CHAIRS.

478
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,643
IT'S NOT ABOUT
BEING SMART.

479
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:39,977
IT'S ABOUT SCREAMING
AS LOUD AS YOU CAN

480
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:42,979
AND PRETENDING
THAT WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

481
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,181
CALL, DAD!
NO, NO--

482
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:47,583

HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

494
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:18,102

00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:30,287
GO THANK YOUR DAD.
FOR WHAT?

517
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,022
I DON'T KNOW.
AN ADVENTURE?

518
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,256
AN ADVENTURE?
(scoffs)

519
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,358
HE WAS USING HIS KIDS
TO PROVE TO THE WORLD
HE WASN'T A LOSER.

520
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:42,662
REALLY?
ON A TV GAME SHOW?

521
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:48,098
WHAT DID YOUR FATHER
DO FOR A LIVING?

522
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:50,066
HE, UH...

523
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,735
(chuckles ) HE OWNED
AN INSURANCE AGENCY.

524
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,370
YOU PLAY GOLF
AS A KID?
YEAH.

525
00:40:56,404 --> 00:41:00,873
LET ME GUESS:
THE WILLOW GLEN COUNTRY CLUB?

526
00:41:00,906 --> 00:41:04,374
AND I BET YOUR MOM
BOUGHT HER ROAST BEEF
FROM MY DAD

527
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:08,078
AT THE ALBERTSON'S 
ON HIGHLAND AVENUE.

528
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,246
THINK SHE EVER NOTICED HIM?

529
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:13,181
WE WEREN'T BETTER
THAN YOU, JUNIOR.

530
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:19,851
WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE
YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE A FAILURE.

531
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:21,819
YEAH?

532
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:23,220
( laughs)

533
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:25,355
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

534
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:27,890
AND I'M GUESSING
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR DAD, EITHER.

535
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,665
HI, I'M STAN TALMADGE,

536
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,167
AND THIS IS MY SON BART
AND HIS TWIN BROTHER BRET.

537
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,302
AH, TWINS. HMM.

538
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:49,170
WHAT? JUST FRATERNAL.
OH.

539
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:53,206
WELL, BRET AND BART,
JUST LIKE THE MAVERICK BROTHERS.

540
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,810
WE ARE A TV FAMILY
THROUGH AND THROUGH.

541
00:41:57,843 --> 00:42:02,212
OKAY. SO WHO'S
THE REST OF YOUR TEAM?

542
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:05,348
UH, NEXT TO BRET IS, UH,
IS HIS WIFE POLLY...

543
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:07,349
HI!
AND, UM,

00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:10,751
AT THE END HERE
IS MY DAUGHTER, JUNIOR.

545
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:15,187
JUNIOR.

546
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,422
HI. IS THAT A--
A NICKNAME OR...?

547
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:22,459
WELL, N-NO.
JUST A NAME.
I MEAN--

548
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:25,761
I MEAN, NOT REALLY, UM,
I MEAN--

549
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:28,796
SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BOY, BUT...

550
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,697
YA KNOW, WELL, WHO KNEW?
IT STUCK.

551
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:34,099
( chuckles )
YEAH.

552
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,935
STAN.

553
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:40,737
LET ME BE FRANK. UH...

554
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,805
OH, GO AHEAD
AND SIT DOWN.

555
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,342
THIS IS
BEAT YOUR NEIGHBOR.

556
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:51,077
WE'RE A CLASS ACT.

557
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:54,779
AND THE NUMBER ONE GAME SHOW
IN AMERICA.

558
00:42:54,812 --> 00:42:56,446
WE HAVE HIGH STANDARDS,

559
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,349
AND WE EXPECT OUR PLAYERS
TO UPHOLD THOSE STANDARDS.

560
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:02,484
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE,
MARTY.

561
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:04,385
Bart: THAT'S RIGHT, DAD!
Polly: THAT'S RIGHT.

562
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,793
( chatter, phone ringing )

563
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:22,163
( studio audience
applauding )

564
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:26,166
HI!

565
00:43:37,874 --> 00:43:40,942
( sighs )
( music playing on radio )

566
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:57,285
OH, FUCK IT!

567
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,356
OH. OHH!

568
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,192
OHH....

569
00:44:06,225 --> 00:44:08,993
( exhales )

570
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:12,028
OH, FORGIVE ME, STAN.

571
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:14,063
OHH.

572
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,232
( sighing )

573
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:44,749
( sniffs )

574
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:51,153
( low nervous chatter )

575
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,492
Marty: HMM.

576
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:09,932
JAMESON FAMILY,
MARTINO FAMILY--

577
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:12,033
CONGRATULATIONS.

578
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:13,967
( cheering)
YES!

579
00:45:15,502 --> 00:45:18,538
THE REST OF YOU,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

580
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,340
WHAT?
NO WAY, MAN.

581
00:45:22,373 --> 00:45:24,374
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

582
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:27,477
JUNIOR!
YOU GOTTA SAVE US. WHAT?

583
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,179
MARTY. I THINK HE HAD
A BIT OF A...

584
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:33,980
HE LIKES YOU.

585
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:36,349
JUST TALK TO HIM.
CHANGE HIS MIND.

586
00:45:36,382 --> 00:45:39,050
WHAT?! DAD!

587
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,085
DO IT FOR ME?

588
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,222
COME ON.

589
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,260
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

590
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,194
OH, IT'S MARTY.
MARTY.

591
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:56,495
HI.
HI.

592
00:45:56,528 --> 00:46:00,264
UM, WHY ARE YOU
SENDING US HOME?

593
00:46:00,297 --> 00:46:06,101
OH. WELL, SOMETIMES
YOU JUST KNOW, SO...

594
00:46:06,135 --> 00:46:09,070
NO, BUT YOU--
YOU
CAN'T
 DO THIS
TO MY DAD.

595
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:12,072
UH, WHY NOT?

596
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,474
HE WANTS SO MUCH
FOR US TO BE ON TV.

597
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:17,342
AND YOU?

598
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,544
WELL...
I CARE ABOUT MY DAD.

599
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:26,947
(low) ENOUGH TO HAVE DINNER
WITH ME TONIGHT?

600
00:46:28,948 --> 00:46:30,150
OKAY.

601
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:32,017
MR. COOPER.

602
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,355
CALL ME MARTY.

603
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:56,100
I'LL GO CHECK ON
THE ROOMS.

604
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:13,144
I TRIED TO GET
ALL CONNECTING ROOMS,

605
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:14,912
BUT NO GO.

606
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,185
YA KNOW, MAYBE IF YOU BOYS
HAD WORN TIES...
COME ON, MAN.

607
00:47:25,686 --> 00:47:27,921
Stan: WELL,
WHAT DO YOU SAY, MAUDE?

608
00:47:27,954 --> 00:47:29,188
WANT TO HEAD TO THE ROOM?

609
00:47:37,226 --> 00:47:39,327
Junior: GET IN,
I'M DRIVING.

610
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:43,130
Maude: HE'S THE PRODUCER
OF THE SHOW?

611
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:45,464
JUST SMILE AND WAVE,
MAUDE.

612
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:01,175
ALL RIGHT!

613
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:03,410
I LIKE A WOMAN WITH BALLS.

614
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:05,911
NICE. YEAH, GO AHEAD,
OPEN IT UP.

615
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:07,212
( gears grind )
YEAH--

616
00:48:07,245 --> 00:48:09,279
YEAH, THIRD GEAR'S
STRAIGHT UP.

617
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:10,614
YEAH.
YEAH.

618
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:14,016
WHOO! IT'S FUN.
YEAH, RIGHT.

619
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,152
COOL.
YOU LOOK GOOD IN A PORSCHE.

620
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,486
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.

621
00:48:32,228 --> 00:48:34,162
WELL, WE TRIED, HUH?

622
00:48:36,397 --> 00:48:39,533
I'M JUST GLAD TO BE
SPENDING SOME TIME WITH MY KIDS.

623
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,972
( sighs )

624
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:51,573
HERE'S TO
JUNIOR'S SUCCESS.

625
00:49:09,418 --> 00:49:12,654
OH, MAN.
THIS IS WHAT I CALL
A FAMILY VACATION.

626
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:14,521
( chuckles )

627
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:20,626
YOU GET HIGH?

628
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,729
I'M GONNA INVITE
YOUR FAMILY BACK.

629
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,431
REALLY?
YEAH.

630
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,566
THANK YOU.
IT'S JUST AN AUDITION.

631
00:49:33,568 --> 00:49:36,003
YEAH...

632
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:39,504
I THINK IT'S A SHAME
NOT TO SHARE YOU WITH
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

633
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:42,339
HMM.

634
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:45,008
BUT I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT BOTANY.

635
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:47,075
NEITHER DO I.

636
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,977
SEE? WE ALREADY HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

637
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,351
( sighs )

638
00:50:13,192 --> 00:50:17,562
TELL AMERICA A FAVORITE WAY
OF GETTING AROUND TOWN!

639
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:19,997
OH!
( bell ringing )

640
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,464
TAXI!

641
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,500
YES!
AMERICA SAYS?

642
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:27,502
( excited laughter )

643
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:34,239
GO, BROTHER!
YEAH!
Marty: OKAY.

644
00:50:34,272 --> 00:50:38,108
TELL AMERICA SOMETHING
THAT COMES FROM THE SOUTH.

645
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:40,777
( bell rings )
COLORED PEOPLE.

646
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,244
OH.
OH.

647
00:50:42,277 --> 00:50:44,246
Did he say
"colored people"?

648
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:53,385
JUST KIDDING.
UH...TOBACCO?

649
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:55,987
AMERICA SAYS?

650
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:02,290
YOU WERE SO GOOD, BABY!
CAN YOU BELIEVE DAD?

651
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:05,259
Junior. Junior.
Walk--walk slower.
Maybe Marty'll--

652
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:07,661
UH,
MISS TALMADGE?
Told you so.

653
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:10,663
THE, UH, OTHER PRODUCERS
AND I HAD SOME QUESTIONS--

654
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:15,333
GOD, HOW DID WE DO?
NO SO GOOD, HUH?

655
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:18,068
GOD, I COULD
LOSE MY JOB FOR THIS.

656
00:51:21,669 --> 00:51:25,472
UM...MEET ME
ON THE SIDEWALK, OKAY?

657
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:27,139
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

658
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:36,213
THAT'S
 MY LITTLE GIRL.

659
00:51:36,246 --> 00:51:38,781
( sighs ) GOD,
DAD, I DON'T KNOW,

660
00:51:38,815 --> 00:51:41,582
I MEAN, COULDN'T WE GET
KICKED OFF THE SHOW FOR THIS?

661
00:51:41,615 --> 00:51:44,584
IT'D BE WORSE FOR HIM.
REMEMBER THAT, JUNIOR.

662
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:48,620
YOU HAVE HIM HOOKED.
JUST...GO IN FOR THE KILL.

663
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,490
( elevator bell rings )

664
00:51:56,725 --> 00:51:58,594
GO IN FOR THE KILL....

665
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:02,529
GO IN FOR THE KILL.

666
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:01,267
YA KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

667
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,103
I, UH...
I SPENT SUMMERS WORKING
AS A FLY FISHING GUIDE

668
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:10,105
ON...ON THE MIDDLE FORK
OF THE SALMON.

669
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:14,409
YOU KNOW IT?
IT'S OUT BY DRIGGS?

670
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:15,777
RIGHT UP-- ANYWAY.

671
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,377
( both laugh )

672
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:20,212
THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO
AT NIGHT,

673
00:53:20,246 --> 00:53:23,515
SO ME AND THE GUYS,
WE'D JUST SIT AROUND THE CABIN

674
00:53:23,548 --> 00:53:26,582
AND TIE FLIES.

675
00:53:26,616 --> 00:53:29,284
THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL,
THOSE LITTLE FLIES,

676
00:53:29,317 --> 00:53:31,386
IT'S...

677
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,255
IT'S ALMOST A SHAME
TO USE 'EM TO CATCH
SOME UGLY FISH.

678
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:39,324
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU DON'T
CATCH THAT BIG FISH,

679
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,461
YOU STILL END UP WITH
A MANGLED FLY.

680
00:53:43,494 --> 00:53:45,829
I HATE TO FISH.

681
00:53:45,862 --> 00:53:48,664
BUT YOU DIDN'T MIND
BEING THE BAIT?

682
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,434
YOU KNOW, THE THING IS...

683
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:56,701
MY DAD DIDN'T BELIEVE
HE COULD WIN ON HIS OWN,

684
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:59,770
SO HE USED US,
HE USED HIS KIDS,

685
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,905
AND...

686
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:05,141
WELL, I REALLY WANTED
TO BELIEVE IN HIM.

687
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:10,144
SUPPORTIVE DAUGHTER,
HUH?

688
00:54:13,213 --> 00:54:16,348
I GUESS I THOUGHT
IT WOULD SHOW EVERYONE

689
00:54:16,382 --> 00:54:21,418
WE WERE A REAL FAMILY
WITH A... A REAL DAD.

690
00:54:21,452 --> 00:54:25,454
A REAL TV FAMILY,
WITH COMPETITIVE BROTHERS.
COMPETITIVE?

691
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:28,457
THAT'S A NICE WAY OF DESCRIBING
THOSE GREEDY BASTARDS.

692
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,858
RIGHT.
SERIOUSLY.

693
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:34,860
ALL THEY HAD TO DO
WAS HOLD IT TOGETHER
FOR ONE MORE DAY.

694
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:37,428
TV:
...THE BASEBALL GOES DEAD.

695
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:40,764
NO WONDER THAT GUY
CAN'T RUN TO FIRST BASE.

696
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:44,365
INSTEAD OF BASEBALL SHOES,
HE'S WEARING....

697
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:46,834
( laughter ) 
( Polly laughs )

698
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,469
( TV continues,
indistinct )

699
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,651
WHAT IF HE DRINKS?

700
00:55:15,385 --> 00:55:17,954
WHAT IF HE'S BOMBED
AT THE NEXT AUDITION,

701
00:55:17,987 --> 00:55:20,490
OR WORSE, ON THE SHOW?
WE COULD LOSE BIG-TIME!

702
00:55:20,523 --> 00:55:22,791
HE WON'T GET DRUNK.

703
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:25,359
HE BARFED AT
HIS OWN WEDDING.

704
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:28,595
YOU WANT TO GAMBLE
OUR FUTURE ON THAT?

705
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:33,631
THAT POOR LITTLE FLOWER GIRL.

706
00:55:40,635 --> 00:55:43,872
WE NEED FIVE, RIGHT?
DUH.

707
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:46,639
WHAT IF HE WAS DEAD?

708
00:55:46,672 --> 00:55:50,475
BART, PEOPLE WOULD KNOW
IF WE DID THAT.

709
00:55:50,509 --> 00:55:52,343
WHAT? WHAT?!

710
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:54,244
WHAT?
WHAT?!

711
00:55:55,445 --> 00:55:58,480
AFTER THE SHOW TODAY
I ASKED BART...

712
00:55:58,514 --> 00:56:00,781
"HOW'D IT FEEL
BEING ON THE SET, SON?"

713
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,782
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?

714
00:56:04,783 --> 00:56:08,487
YEAH.
NO, YOU DON'T.

715
00:56:08,521 --> 00:56:10,522
NO, I DON'T.

716
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:12,956
HE SAID...

717
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,992
"IT WAS LIKE BREATHING, DAD.

718
00:56:16,025 --> 00:56:17,626
EASY."

719
00:56:39,306 --> 00:56:41,641
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING GOOD.

720
00:56:41,674 --> 00:56:45,510
UH...YEAH,
CHECK THIS OUT.

721
00:56:45,544 --> 00:56:47,344
UM...

722
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:51,914
SOMEBODY SAID TO BUY--
THEY'RE BRITISH, I THINK.

723
00:56:51,947 --> 00:56:53,782
YOU THINK?

724
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:55,750
( laughs )

725
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:05,557
( up-tempo rock song
playing on stereo )

726
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:22,033
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
BE AN ACTRESS.

727
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:23,735
( laughs )

728
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:26,770
I, UM, I BET YOU
TELL US ALL THAT.

729
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:29,271
"US"? NO.

730
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:32,574
SO, UH....

731
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:36,310
IF NOT AN ACTRESS,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?

732
00:57:36,343 --> 00:57:38,878
I WANT TO BE A CHEF.
A CHEF.

733
00:57:38,911 --> 00:57:41,845
ISN'T THAT LIKE
BEING A MAID?

734
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,714
YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE MY MOTHER.

735
00:57:43,747 --> 00:57:46,282
WHAT DOES YOUR DAD SAY?

736
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,953
MY DAD. UM...

737
00:57:50,986 --> 00:57:53,754
MY DAD PUT ME UP TO THIS.

738
00:57:53,788 --> 00:57:55,722
PUT ME UP TO YOU.

739
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,457
AH.

740
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,459
I LOVE THIS SONG.

741
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:12,532
SO, IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE...HERE,
FOR YOUR DAD?

742
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:14,867
I'M HERE TO DANCE.

743
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:17,769

MORNING.

01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:10,574

UM, EGGS AND TOAST AND...

770
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:23,884
MARTY?
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

771
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:27,419
I CALLED.

772
01:00:27,452 --> 01:00:30,621
THERE'S A CAB
WAITING OUT FRONT.

773
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:34,489
OH.

774
01:00:34,523 --> 01:00:37,358
OKAY, WELL...THANKS.

775
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:46,698
UH, WE TAPE TOMORROW MORNING,
ELEVEN A.M.

776
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:48,833
DON'T BE LATE.
WHAT?

777
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:50,801
WE'RE ON THE SHOW?
YEAH.

778
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:53,402
TOMORROW AS IN, LIKE,
THE-DAY-AFTER-TODAY TOMORROW?

779
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:59,939
AFTER THAT I NEVER
WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

780
01:00:59,972 --> 01:01:02,874
( laughs )
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

781
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:06,910
JUNIOR, I COULD HAVE
LOST MY JOB.

782
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,647
MY CAREER.

783
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,082
YOU USED ME TO GET ON
A TV SHOW.

784
01:01:13,115 --> 01:01:16,683
YEAH, BUT...YOU GOT
WHAT YOU WANTED, TOO.

785
01:01:16,717 --> 01:01:18,852
WELL, WE'RE EVEN.

786
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,121
CONGRATULATIONS.

787
01:01:23,154 --> 01:01:25,889
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
HOW WE MET?

788
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:28,825
GOD, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE
ON THIS STUPID SHOW.

789
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:31,692
I JUST-- I-I WANT TO
GO TO DISNEYLAND.

790
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:33,962
AND I...

791
01:01:33,995 --> 01:01:36,796
I ONLY DID THIS
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE CUTE.

792
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:42,100
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
HAVE US ON THE SHOW,

793
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:44,434
I UNDERSTAND.

794
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,104
I'D RATHER HAVE YOU.

795
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:01,712
I'D RATHER
YOU WERE ON THE SHOW.

796
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:43,572
JUNIOR!

797
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:46,007
JUNIOR!

798
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,108
JUNIOR,
ARE YOU IN THERE?

799
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:09,822
HEY, JUNIOR,

800
01:03:09,855 --> 01:03:11,856
I NOTICED THAT, UM...

801
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,192
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR RING.

802
01:03:14,225 --> 01:03:15,994
HOW COME?

803
01:03:24,965 --> 01:03:27,767
MAUDE, I'M SUCH
A TERRIBLE PERSON.

804
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:31,536
I SPENT THE NIGHT
WITH MARTY.

805
01:03:37,072 --> 01:03:41,076
HONEY, THAT DOES
NOT 
MAKE YOU A TERRIBLE PERSON.

806
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:44,578
IT MAKES YOU A SLUT.

807
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:46,046
( sobs )

808
01:03:48,714 --> 01:03:52,950
GOD, I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE DAD HAPPY, YOU KNOW?

809
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:59,053
I WANTED TO BE HIS HERO.

810
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:03,490
AND IT DIDN'T MATTER ANYMORE
THAT WE NEVER GOT TO
SEE HIM AS KIDS.

811
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:07,927
HE'S MY DAD.

812
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:13,230
AFTER THE CANCER--
HE DOESN'T HAVE CANCER,
JUNIOR.

813
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:17,098
WHAT?

814
01:04:17,132 --> 01:04:19,900
MAUDE, I NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.

815
01:04:19,934 --> 01:04:22,135
HE LIED. TO YOU.

816
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:25,704
TO US. TO ME.

817
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:32,709
OF COURSE HE DID.
YEAH.

818
01:04:34,877 --> 01:04:38,213
IT'S NO PARK WALK
THINKING THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S
DYING OF CANCER,

819
01:04:38,246 --> 01:04:40,747
LET ME TELL YOU.

820
01:04:40,781 --> 01:04:45,917
BUT LOOK, JUNIOR,
IF I LEFT EVERY MAN
OR EVERY DAD

821
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:48,953
EVERY TIME
HE DID SOMETHING TERRIBLE,

822
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:52,688
I WOULD BE
AN ALONE WOMAN.

823
01:04:52,721 --> 01:04:57,058
THAT'S LIFE.
IT'S A BUNCH OF CHOICES.

824
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:59,693
BUT JUNIOR,
WHAT I DO KNOW,

825
01:04:59,726 --> 01:05:05,129
YOUR DAD'S GOOD,
IT'S MORE THAN HIS BAD.

826
01:05:05,163 --> 01:05:08,699
THAT'S WHY I STAY WITH HIM--
FOR NOW.

827
01:05:08,732 --> 01:05:11,633
THAT SELFISH
SON OF A BITCH!

828
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:15,069
HOPE YOU'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT ME.
( laughs )

829
01:05:18,304 --> 01:05:21,107
( imitating Three Stooges)
NYUH NYUH.

830
01:05:23,675 --> 01:05:25,943
AH.

831
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,114
WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE, DAD?

832
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,150
TIME.

833
01:05:41,086 --> 01:05:43,721
YOU TOLD US
YOU WERE
DYING.

834
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:53,027
NO, YOU JUST
BELIEVED THAT.

835
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,728
I TOLD YOU
I HAVE CANCER.

836
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:57,129
A MOLE THAT
DR. OLSON REMOVED.

837
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,831
YOU LIED ABOUT THE MOTORHOME,

838
01:05:59,864 --> 01:06:03,000
THE SHOW, THE TRIP--
EVERYTHING.

839
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:07,002
HONEY, IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
THAT I COULD HAVE TIME
WITH MY LITTLE GIRL.

840
01:06:07,035 --> 01:06:09,704
I'M NOT YOUR LITTLE GIRL!
OKAY, I KNOW.

841
01:06:11,672 --> 01:06:13,173
I KNOW.

842
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:18,176
BUT IT WAS REAL IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT YOU DID COME...

843
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:23,113
AND THAT MAUDE AND ME
GOT SOME TIME WITH YOU
AND THE TWINS.

844
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:27,949
NO. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU
THAT YOU WERE ON
THAT RETARDED SHOW!

845
01:06:27,982 --> 01:06:32,351
YEAH, YEAH,
BUT NOT TO BE
ON
 THE SHOW;
TO BE A
FAMILY--

846
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:34,186
TOGETHER.

847
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,322
TO BE A FAMILY
THAT WINS TOGETHER.

848
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:39,123
( scoffs )
SO WHAT?

849
01:06:48,095 --> 01:06:52,665
YOU KNOW HOW MANY MILES
WERE ON THAT CAMPER
WHEN GRAMPS DIED?

850
01:06:52,698 --> 01:06:55,767
TEN. TEN MILES.

851
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,037
THAT'S THE DISTANCE
FROM THE DEALERSHIP
TO THEIR HOUSE.

852
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,772
THEY OWNED THAT MOTORHOME
FOR A YEAR,

853
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:06,107
AND THEY NEVER
ONCE
 USED IT.

854
01:07:06,141 --> 01:07:10,310
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE AS MY DAD.

855
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:27,220
MAYBE YOU JUST LOVED STAN MORE
THAN HE COULD LOVE YOU BACK.

856
01:07:29,188 --> 01:07:32,023
WHAT WOULD YOU
KNOW ABOUT IT?

857
01:07:32,057 --> 01:07:35,960
YOUR MOM CALLED YOU
EVERY DAY, ANDREW.

858
01:07:35,993 --> 01:07:38,695
WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?

859
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:41,330
CLEARY,
SHE LOVED YOU TO DEATH.

860
01:07:43,764 --> 01:07:46,799
MOM KILLED HERSELF, OKAY?
YOU HAPPY?

861
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:50,903
OHH...GOD...

862
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:52,236
NO.

863
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:54,972
SHE SHOT HERSELF.

864
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:58,808
IT WAS HER BIRTHDAY.

865
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,009
OH, ANDREW.

866
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,944
I'M, UM...

867
01:08:03,978 --> 01:08:06,045
I'M VERY SORRY.

868
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,379
IT'S OKAY.

869
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:13,383
SHE, UM...

870
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:16,453
SHE LEFT A NOTE.

871
01:08:16,486 --> 01:08:19,120
IT SAID, UM...

872
01:08:19,153 --> 01:08:22,856
IT SAID, "I'M TIRED."

873
01:08:22,889 --> 01:08:25,257
I KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT.

874
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,425
DO YOU?

875
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:30,160
I MEAN, DO YOU?
BECAUSE I'M...

876
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:33,930
I'M HERE EVERY TUESDAY
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

877
01:08:33,963 --> 01:08:37,398
MAYBE THAT'S WHY SHE'S HERE
AND NOT DRIFTING OVER MANHATTAN.

878
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:57,911
YOU OKAY?

879
01:08:57,945 --> 01:08:59,979
I JUST...

880
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:06,218
I KEEP ASKING MYSELF
WAS IT MY FAULT, YOU KNOW?

881
01:09:10,453 --> 01:09:14,155
WE ARE
NOT
 RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE WAY THEY TREATED US.

882
01:09:43,207 --> 01:09:45,175
DO YOU WANT THAT?

883
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:48,477
NOT LIKE IT'S GONNA
DO ME ANY GOOD.
Bret: DAD.

884
01:09:48,511 --> 01:09:50,478
WE NEED TO TALK.

885
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:53,113
ME AND BRET AND POLLY
HAVE BEEN TALKIN',

886
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,882
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT THE SHOW--

887
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:57,016
DAD, SINCE YOU ALREADY
WON ONCE IN A GAME SHOW,
WE THOUGHT--

888
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,117
STAN, WHAT SHOW
WERE YOU ON?
MAUDE, SHUT UP.

889
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:02,053
MATCH GAME,
 MAUDE.
 HE WAS ON
THE MATCH GAME.

890
01:10:02,086 --> 01:10:03,921
HE WAS?

891
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:06,889
I THOUGHT YOU MADE THAT UP,
STAN. CONGRATULATIONS!

892
01:10:06,922 --> 01:10:09,290
WHAT, MAUDE?
LET'S--LET'S TALK LATER,

893
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:10,892
OKAY, BOYS?

894
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:26,902
WHAT IS
WITH YOU?

895
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:30,871
PICK UP THOSE CARDS.

896
01:10:30,905 --> 01:10:33,873
MAUDE, LEAVE IT!

897
01:10:33,907 --> 01:10:35,507
CARDS, BART. NOW.

898
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:38,176
MAUDE, HOW DID DAD
BUY THAT CAMPER?

899
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:40,310
LEAVE HER OUT OF THIS,
OKAY?

900
01:10:40,343 --> 01:10:43,145
I'M THE PATRIARCH,
AND WHAT I SAY GOES.
WERE YOU ON
MATCH GAME?

901
01:10:45,514 --> 01:10:49,149
WERE YOU ON FUCKIN'
MATCH GAME, 
YES OR NO?

902
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:51,884
NO. BUT--
GODDAMNIT!

903
01:10:51,918 --> 01:10:55,020
DAD! I BELIEVED YOUR LIES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

904
01:10:55,053 --> 01:10:57,021
I FORGIVE YOU,
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN

905
01:10:57,054 --> 01:10:59,956
I TALKED MYSELF INTO BELIEVING
THAT YOU ACTUALLY
CARE
 ABOUT US.

906
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,957
I CARE ABOUT YOU--
WHY DO YOU LIE?!

907
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:04,125
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D BELIEVE WE COULD WIN.

908
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:07,861
AWRIGHT?
I THOUGHT I NEEDED PROOF,
PROOF THAT I COULD BE A WINNER.

909
01:11:07,894 --> 01:11:10,297
I MEANT WHY DO YOU LIE
ABOUT CARING, DAD.

910
01:11:13,299 --> 01:11:15,834
WE ALL WANTED
TO BE ON TV, DAD.

911
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:19,869
I-I'M SORRY.

912
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:22,337
YOU'RE ALWAYS FUCKIN' SORRY,
NOTHING EVER FUCKIN' CHANGES.

913
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:26,107
WHAT?
ELEVEN A.M.

914
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:28,341
TOMORROW MORNING.

915
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:34,277
YOU'RE ON THE SHOW.

916
01:11:36,013 --> 01:11:39,281
( laughing, cheering )

917
01:11:58,026 --> 01:12:00,095
MOM?
Helen:
JUNIOR?

918
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:02,497
YEAH. (sighs)

919
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,065
CAN YOU COME PICK ME UP?

920
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,498
BART.

921
01:12:56,532 --> 01:12:58,900
AAAH!
OH!

922
01:12:58,933 --> 01:13:00,267
OH! UM...
BART!

923
01:13:02,902 --> 01:13:04,969
OH, WHAT THE--

924
01:13:05,003 --> 01:13:09,105
WHAT THE HELL, JUNIOR?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

925
01:13:09,138 --> 01:13:11,507
WHO...WHO ARE YOU?

926
01:13:13,475 --> 01:13:15,577
THIS IS BREEZE.

927
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:18,646
HI.
HI.

928
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:21,314
UH, I'M GONNA GO.

929
01:13:21,347 --> 01:13:25,149
WELL, JUNIOR,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

930
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:30,152
I CALLED MOM.

931
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:32,654
I--
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

932
01:13:32,687 --> 01:13:35,389
AND I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE,

933
01:13:35,422 --> 01:13:37,323
AND NOW SHE'S ON HER WAY--
WAIT, WAIT.

934
01:13:37,356 --> 01:13:40,259
MOM'S COMING HERE
TO CALIFORNIA?

935
01:13:40,293 --> 01:13:41,394
YEAH.

936
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:47,630
WELL, JUNIOR, LOOKS LIKE
COLLEGE ACTUALLY DID
PAY OFF FOR YOU, HUH?

937
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:50,599
SO YOU THINK MARTY'LL
LET US SWITCH THE TEAMS?

938
01:13:50,632 --> 01:13:54,167
UH...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

939
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:56,203
MOM INSTEAD OF DAD.

940
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:58,904
HEY! I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED
ME.

941
01:13:58,938 --> 01:14:00,939
THAT'S NOT WHY
I CALLED HER--

942
01:14:00,972 --> 01:14:02,673
JUNIOR...

943
01:14:02,706 --> 01:14:05,209
DAD CUT US
OUT OF HIS LIFE.

944
01:14:05,242 --> 01:14:09,045
NOW, THIS WOULD BE
A VERY SMART TIME FOR US
TO CUT HIM OUT OFOURS.

945
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,146
SO THAT YOU COULD BE ON TV.

946
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:15,381
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA 
CUT OFF THE BIG TOE
SO YOU CAN SAVE THE FOOT.

947
01:14:15,415 --> 01:14:19,951
OKAY, BART, WHAT IF
EVERYTHING ABOUT DAD WAS WRONG,

948
01:14:19,984 --> 01:14:22,319
WAS A LIE?

949
01:14:22,352 --> 01:14:25,054
WOULDN'T YOU STILL
WANT
 HIM?

950
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:28,356
I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
HAVE A DAD THAN NOT AT ALL?

951
01:14:28,389 --> 01:14:32,960
NO. I WOULD RATHER
HAVE THE PRIZE MONEY
THAN TO HAVE HIM AS A DAD.

952
01:14:32,993 --> 01:14:36,229
WHY DO YOU HATE HIM
SO MUCH, BART?

953
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:39,496
I HATE HIM BECAUSE
HE LIES TO US, JUNIOR;
HE ALWAYS HAS.

954
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:43,099
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS PLANNED OUT BY HIM.

955
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:46,934
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
THE SON OF A BITCH WAS LYING
ABOUT HAVING CANCER.

956
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:50,470
WHAT?

957
01:14:55,274 --> 01:14:57,976
JUNIOR,
DOES HE HAVE CANCER?

958
01:14:58,009 --> 01:15:00,077
I-I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

959
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:02,044
Breeze: NICE TO MEET YOU.
JUNIOR!

960
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:15,253
HE DOESN'T HAVE CANCER,
DOES HE?

961
01:15:19,022 --> 01:15:20,156
NO.

962
01:15:29,161 --> 01:15:30,563
WOW.

963
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:34,365
( glass shatters )

964
01:15:34,398 --> 01:15:36,400
THAT FUCKIN'
SON OF A BITCH.

965
01:15:36,433 --> 01:15:39,401
BART, I--
THAT FUCKIN'
SON OF A BITCH.

966
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:49,975
( door slams )

967
01:16:03,584 --> 01:16:05,818
( indistinct chatter )

968
01:16:09,687 --> 01:16:11,622
( sighs )

969
01:16:11,656 --> 01:16:13,758
SO DAD,

970
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:16,559
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THE SHOW, AND--
Polly: MORNING!

971
01:16:18,627 --> 01:16:21,995
MORNING.
THREE GENERATIONS
ALL HERE.

972
01:16:25,564 --> 01:16:29,466
DAD, LET'S JUST SKIP THE SHOW
AND GO TO DISNEYLAND TODAY.

973
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,435
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OH, JESUS, MARY AND JANE,

974
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:34,436
I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS.

975
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:37,472
DAD, WE NEED TO TALK.
YEAH, LET'S
TALK.

976
01:16:37,506 --> 01:16:39,440
BRET, DON'T DO THIS.

977
01:16:42,609 --> 01:16:46,278
WE NEED SOMEONE
WE CAN COUNT ON
NOT TO LOSE IT.

978
01:16:46,312 --> 01:16:49,146
WE NEED SOMEONE
WE CAN TRUST.

979
01:16:49,179 --> 01:16:52,481
WE NEED SOMEONE
WE CAN TRUST, STAN.

980
01:16:52,515 --> 01:16:54,616
DAD.

981
01:16:54,649 --> 01:16:59,986
TELL AMERICA THE TOP
300 OTHER PEOPLE WE WOULD
RATHER HAVE ON THE TEAM.

982
01:17:02,255 --> 01:17:04,057
SURPRISE!

983
01:17:05,624 --> 01:17:08,125
DON'T ACT SO EXCITED, STAN.

984
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,161
MOM. MOM'S WHO WE NEED.

985
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:12,194
OH, GOD.

986
01:17:14,762 --> 01:17:16,763
YOU WANT TO CUT ME?

987
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:22,500
THE
DAD?

988
01:17:24,768 --> 01:17:27,604
FROM THE TEAM?
MY TEAM?

989
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:31,040
MY FAMILY?

990
01:17:33,642 --> 01:17:35,743
( laughs/snorts )

991
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,744
AND YOU WANT...

992
01:17:37,777 --> 01:17:39,144
AN
OUTSIDER?

993
01:17:39,178 --> 01:17:41,612
OH, AN OUTSIDER?

994
01:17:41,646 --> 01:17:45,215
I HAPPEN TO BE THEIR MOTHER,
AND I'M A LOT SMARTER THAN YOU,
STAN.

995
01:17:45,248 --> 01:17:46,716
OKAY, MOM, THAT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY RIGHT NOW.

996
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:49,351
HELEN'S A ROCK.

997
01:17:49,384 --> 01:17:51,586
DO YOU HEAR THAT, STAN?

998
01:17:51,619 --> 01:17:53,154
I'M A
ROCK.

999
01:17:55,089 --> 01:17:58,224
YEAH...WE NEED
A ROCK, DAD.

1000
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:02,493
( chuckling )

1001
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:12,799
HELEN'S A ROCK?

1002
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:17,103
A
ROCK.

1003
01:18:18,304 --> 01:18:20,071
A ROCK!
AAAH!

1004
01:18:20,105 --> 01:18:21,605
STAN!

1005
01:18:21,638 --> 01:18:22,806
A ROCK! DAD!

1006
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,607
A ROCK?!!!

1007
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,808
A
ROCK?! 
STAN! STAN!

1008
01:18:26,842 --> 01:18:28,577
A ROCK?!
STAN! NO.

1009
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:32,612
STAN, JUST--JUST STOP IT.

1010
01:18:39,683 --> 01:18:42,519
YOU THINK YOU
CHANGED THEIR MINDS?

1011
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:46,621
ALL YOU DID
WAS SHOW THESE KIDS
HOW FUCKIN' NUTS YOU ARE.

1012
01:18:46,654 --> 01:18:48,256
GOD, MOM, JUST GO!

1013
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:50,324
GO!

1014
01:18:50,357 --> 01:18:53,493
JUNIOR, LET'S GO. NOW.

1015
01:18:56,395 --> 01:18:59,195
Bart: COME ON, JUNIOR.

1016
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:01,097
WE NEED YOU ON THE SHOW TO WIN.

1017
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:03,365
JUNIOR, GO WITH 'EM.
NO.

1018
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:05,434
JUNIOR, HE'S A LOSER.

1019
01:19:19,876 --> 01:19:22,577
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
AMOUNT TO ANYTHING,
YOU KNOW THAT?

1020
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:26,313
YOU COULDN'T BE ON A GAME SHOW
IF YOU WERE THE LAST
CONTESTANT ON EARTH.

1021
01:19:26,347 --> 01:19:30,082
FACE IT, OLD MAN,
YOU'RE WORTHLESS
AND YOU'RE STUPID.

1022
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:34,419
LET'S GO.

1023
01:19:46,793 --> 01:19:48,394
MOM, JUST GO.

1024
01:19:51,862 --> 01:19:54,097
