(melancholy vocalizing music)

3
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,730
To Neil Brar, Hollywood
Manager, California, U.S.A.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,510
Dear Neil.

5
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,000
This is Shalini Singh,
your fiancee from India.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,083
We haven't heard from
you since your parents

7
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,450
died in that car crash.

8
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,710
I have some very exciting news.

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,140
I am ready to graduate from the college

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,740
of cooking and cleaning
in Himalayas, India

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,963
and ready for our arranged marriage.

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,690
I still remember that day 20 years ago

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,880
when you and I got engaged before

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,540
you and your family moved to America.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,120
Each of those nights I have
looked at the night sky

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,060
and wondered if my soul mate in America

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,123
is looking at the same stars I am.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,840
Remember the plastic engagement ring

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,083
you put on my finger?

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,500
I still wear it on my pinky.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,250
I can't wait to move to
America and live with you,

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,850
in the land of the white people.

No listen, this is not
small town Tennessee, okay?

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,090
You can't hold the door
open for people in Atlanta.

You have to slam it shut

What's that?

Nicole Westham's address,
we're going out tonight.

58
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,893
I asked her yesterday
and she's like, okay.

59
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,093
I know, whatever.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
My God, wait, there she is.

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,110

Hey Nicole.

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,050
We still on tonight?

00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,483
Yeah, five o'clock, sharp.

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,194

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,513
- [Man On Phone] There's no Nicole here.

82
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,150
This is Pizza Piglet.

83
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,340
Um.

84
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,940
I think I have the wrong number.

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,780
Rob Shorwell?

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,613
Yeah.

87
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,260
I was told to give this to you.

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,120
And to tell you to have
fun by yourself and

89
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,130
leave Nicole alone.

90
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,610
Sorry, dude.

91
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,823
At least it's pepperoni.

92
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:59,050
(laughing)

93
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,883
I'm sorry.

94
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:01,050
Let me get this straight now.

95
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,080
She agrees to go out with you

96
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,040
only if you write her final term paper

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,350
and you fall for this why, bro?

98
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,894
That's not helping.

99
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:12,219
It's like all I want is my American dream.

100
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,160
You know, fast car, big house,

101
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,920
white picket fence, two point five kids.

102
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,620
Although three kids would be fine.

103
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,573
I want it with the girl I love.

104
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:26,130
Is that so much to ask?

105
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,910
Well listen, Rob.

106
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,810
You gave her your heart and she gave you

107
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,580
stuffed crust pizza, man.

108
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,552
I'm not rich.

109
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:33,700
You know, I'm not as rich as that guy.

110
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,810
Or athletic, or handsome.

111
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,706
But, I'm nice.

112
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:38,539
You know, aren't I nice?

113
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,300
That's gotta count for something.

114
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,630
Nice?

115
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,057
Rob, listen, let me...

116
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,757
Let me break it down for you.

117
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:45,590
All right.

118
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,423
The Pope is nice.

119
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:47,256
Pope.

120
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:49,240
Okay, but unless he's drivin' a Porsche

121
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,120
or he's like a GQ model
or he can kick a football

122
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,453
50 yards, she's not
gonna go for him, either.

123
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,600
That's really good
advice coming from a guy

124
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,573
who hasn't dated since the third grade.

125
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:02,325
Man.

126
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:04,942
(girls chattering)

127
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,417
- [Neil] Whoa, whoa, whoa, ladies.

128
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:07,770
Who's that guy and why are all the girls

129
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,770
running towards him?

130
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,660
Oh, that's Neil Brar.

131
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,610
Hey, he's a Hollywood manager,
like, celebrity maker.

132
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,450
You know, he's a guest speaker
at the film department fest.

133
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,380
You see, this is a perfect example.

134
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,555
Now, a creature like
that, that's who snares

135
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,780
broads like her.

136
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,470
Um, I was...

137
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,020
You're based in L.A.
after we graduate, right?

138
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,853
Yup.

139
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm gonna come with you.

140
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:34,980
You joining the military?

141
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,410
Yeah, no, no.

142
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,703
I'm gonna become a Hollywood
manager, celebrity maker.

143
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,258
(uptempo music)

144
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,950
Thank you so much.

145
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,760
Mr. Brar?

146
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,578
Hi, I'm Rob.

147
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,694
Robert Shorwell, I called
you this morning about a job

148
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:07,440
at your company.

149
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,870
Graduating in two weeks,

150
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,623
Masters in PR, summa cum laude.

151
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,680
I could use someone with your record.

152
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,943
Tell you what, you start
as soon as you graduate.

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,273
Thank you.

154
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,630
All right, well I gotta get some sleep.

155
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,682
These girls are wearing me out.

156
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:26,349
(uptempo music)

157
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,880
I heard he asked Tracy
Carmichael out to dinner.

158
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,180
Oh, I should have gone
with a shorter skirt.

159
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,137
I really wanted Neil to like me.

160
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:40,350
Maybe you should have been
nicer to Robert Shorwell.

161
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,183
Why?

162
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,680
Do you mind if I join you?

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,530
I was just leaving.

164
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,490
At least let me tell you what happened

165
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,910
the other day.

166
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,440
Okay.

167
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
See, um...

168
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,543
Well, in high school,

169
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,680
I dated this guy and well,
we were madly in love and

170
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,430
the day before graduation he was

171
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,142
killed in a motorcycle accident.

172
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:09,309
(weeping)

173
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,983
Oh my God.

174
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,143
I had no idea.

175
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm so sorry.

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,553
It was totally awful, you know?

177
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,773
I mean, just ruined my graduation party.

178
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,370
Ever since then, I'm
just really mean to guys

179
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,340
that I like, you know,
just so they'll hate me.

180
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,442
Almost, so I don't have
to get close and then

181
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:32,913
get hurt again.

182
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,170
Anyway, I just wanted to
set the record straight

183
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,660
before I move to L.A.

184
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,317
Wait, you're moving to L.A.?

185
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:42,593
Yeah.

186
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,367
Nicole, Nicole.

187
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,655
I'm moving to L.A.

188
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:47,900
Really?

189
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,733
Really.

190
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,155
Do you want a ride?

191
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,738
(lively music)

192
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,290
- [Ben On Radio] Good morning, L.A.

193
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,950
Ben Dover here with news you can use.

194
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,190
This just in.

195
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,390
Auditions begin today for Alan Smithee's

196
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,200
Last Blonde Standing,
the show that proudly

197
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,730
celebrates blonde cells over gray cells.

198
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,650
This, on the heels of
his earlier creation,

199
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,867
No Romance Without Finance.

200
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,892
(lively music)

201
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:20,642
(goats bleating)

202
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:25,350
(engine rumbling)

203
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:30,542
(speaking foreign language)

204
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,375
Happy.

205
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,900
So, how does it feel to
have a Master's degree?

206
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,542
I was first both in English and cooking.

207
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,553
Ready for my arranged marriage now.

208
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,280
Be a good wife, a good mother.

209
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,340
Did you talk to any boys?

210
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,810
Yes, from the boys' college.

211
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,229
One girl, she even had
hands with one of them.

212
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,062
Really?

213
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:49,895
What are they like?

214
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,104
Annoying, just like him.

215
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:52,779
(laughing)

216
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,940
(lively music)

217
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,067
Did you bring me a skirt?

218
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,089
No, you know Ma would
not let you wear that.

219
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,390
It would bring too much
shame on the family.

220
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,540
No more than your lot has brought us.

221
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,192
The whole village knows by now.

222
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,025
Knows what?

223
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,555
That you're fiance has a
(mumbling) for America.

224
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:08,300
Your arranged marriage is
over before it even started

225
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,967
and in two years, you will be
(speaking foreign language).

226
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,627
(tense music)

227
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:16,785
Americans.

228
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,114
(melancholy vocalizing music)

229
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:20,939
(goat bleating)

230
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,010
But Neelu's not really American, huh?

231
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,790
He's from here, remember?

232
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,780
Yes, but ever since your
in-laws died in that car crash

233
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,500
in America, we haven't heard
from that Indian of yours.

234
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,333
- [Shalini] Still.

235
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,223
Dad keeps writing him to come claim you.

236
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,830
Maybe Neelu didn't really
get Daddy-ji's letters.

237
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,380
Okay, try telling Dad that.

238
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,870
It's killing him that we
are going to our cousin's

239
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,051
wedding in Canada in two months
and she is younger than you!

240
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:43,476
Luti is getting married?

241
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:44,309
Yeah.

242
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:45,720
And who's paying for these tickets?

243
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,880
Bubbly uncle.

244
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,857
He makes (mumbling).

245
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,301
Lucky family, not cursed like ours.

246
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,370
(uptempo rock music)

247
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,530
- [Ben On Radio] Good morning, L.A.

248
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,970
Ben Dover here with news you can use.

249
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,520
This just in.

250
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,860
Nicole Westham, recent
winner of Alan Smithee's

251
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,630
Last Blonde Standing is
now lead in Smithee's

252
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,899
upcoming feature, AmeriBabe.

253
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,770
I gotta run, Gary wants us

254
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,740
at this stupid meeting this morning.

255
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,573
Oh, no.

256
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,970
What's more important than
pleasing your star client?

257
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,697
Strong play, I like that.

258
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,311
You're almost there, too.

259
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,090
No, no, please.

260
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,340
All right, let me call
Rob, have him take notes.

261
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,310
Ugh, so sick of him.

262
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,470
When are you gonna get rid of him?

263
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,760
I already told Gary I want him gone.

264
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,130
Well, I'm tired of living with him.

265
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,260
Well then, pack your bags
and come live with me.

266
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,636
Really?

267
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,100
With the exception of her,

268
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,543
we haven't had any decent
bookings this year.

269
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,490
What's going on?

270
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,790
Gary, we've been going through
our records all morning.

271
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,623
This--

272
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:45,950
Yeah, we've submitted our clients

273
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,300
for every role out there.

274
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,740
They're just aren't booking.

275
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,300
They just aren't booking?

276
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,820
That answer's just not helping.

277
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,540
Can I say some...

278
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,373
Sorry.

279
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:56,200
Does it start with here's your coffee?

280
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,083
Let him speak.

281
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,040
Well, we bring in clients
based on a gut decision,

282
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,940
right, and then we throw
them into the audition routes

283
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,660
hoping that something sticks,

284
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,210
but what it we had a division
that groomed new clients?

285
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,630
You know, made them
into celebrity material

286
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,321
before they hit the audition routes.

287
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:17,940
I mean, that's the strategy
that I used with Nicole.

288
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,100
Who created Nicole's strategy?

289
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,140
Well, I did.

290
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,490
That's not what I heard from Neil.

291
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,940
It doesn't matter, but
a division that grooms

292
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,094
new clients into celebrity
material, I like that.

293
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:31,495
(lively music)

294
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:35,162
(speaking foreign language)

295
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,180
Happy, take those bags out.

296
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,920
Huh, what?

297
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,670
Daddy-ji I can't stay here.

298
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,137
I want to go to America and find Neelu.

299
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:51,310
Are you crazy?

300
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,500
What will all the neighbors say?

301
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,200
The neighbors are saying enough already,

302
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,040
and I don't want Littly
to suffer because of me.

303
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,860
The 30 year old spinster.

304
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,079
Desperate times do call
for desperate measures.

305
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:00,912
(speaking foreign language)

306
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,070
And get into the kitchen.

307
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,500
Fine, and I'll stay there because no one

308
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,450
wants to marry me anyway.

309
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,620
And don't start eating.

310
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,140
If you get any fatter, we'll definitely

311
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,560
not find anyone for you.

312
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,830
Oh, God.

313
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,250
What did we do to deserve this?

314
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,186
I'm gonna go play with the goat.

315
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:18,930
(goat bleating)

316
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,390
Daddy-ji, I will be 30 soon.

317
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,853
Oh, why don't you shout
it from the rooftops?

318
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,490
Just let me go for two months.

319
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,530
I will either meet you
in Canada with Neelu,

320
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,573
or your truly cursed daughter

321
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:31,633
will come back to India with you.

322
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:35,848
(speaking foreign language)

323
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:38,431
(mellow music)

324
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,550
But Daddy-ji, these are
all of your savings.

325
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,973
No price is too high to see
a smile on my child's face.

326
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:57,744
It's okay.

327
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,599
(lively music)

328
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:12,724
(knocking)

329
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:13,557
Sorry I'm late.

330
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:14,390
Car broke down.

331
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,520
Did I miss anything?

332
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,710
Just your intern getting promoted.

333
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,543
Excuse me?

334
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:19,376
He's good.

335
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,747
Not to mention, he doesn't
miss important meetings.

336
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,690
I'm promoting him to manager.

337
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, there are only
three manager positions,

338
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,150
and they're all taken.

339
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,760
Not for long.

340
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,920
Your contract runs out
in a couple of months

341
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,500
and you're not delivering.

342
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,140
Rob's idea today was brilliant.

343
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,973
What idea?

344
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:39,340
About creating a new division

345
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,520
based on the strategy he used on Nicole.

346
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that was my idea.

347
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,170
I can't believe he would
try to pass that off as his.

348
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,070
What, you think I lied to you?

349
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,928
You really want me to answer that?

350
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,210
(phone ringing)

351
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,373
How dare you try and steal my job.

352
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,300
Wait, what, no.

353
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,780
Gary just liked my strategy
that I used on Nicole,

354
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,480
which I believe you've
been taking credit for.

355
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,410
And you, I believe, have been trying

356
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,550
to stab me in the back.

357
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,770
Well, this is a great way to
thank me after I bring you

358
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,130
in here, I give your
girlfriend a shot at her dream

359
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,733
and now I'm gonna lose my job over it?

360
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,580
Lose your job?

361
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,270
Why, why, why would you lose your job?

362
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,433
Gary wants me gone,

363
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,163
unless you step in and help.

364
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,973
Okay.

365
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:23,498
I mean, I owe you one.

366
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:25,600
You gave Nicole her break
and you got me a job.

367
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,530
What can I do?

368
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,490
Well, you can put it in writing

369
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,110
that you lied about the idea being yours.

370
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,870
Write that I lied?

371
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,703
He'll fire me.

372
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,203
One of us is getting the ax.

373
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,510
Thought you owed me.

374
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,020
Lord knows what'll
happen to Nicole's career

375
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,443
if I leave this place.

376
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:48,040
(phone ringing)

377
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:55,544
(lively music)

378
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,286
It happened, Dave.

379
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,119
Hi.

380
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,936
- [Neil] Hey sweetheart.

381
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:19,769
How are you?

382
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:20,986
(giggling)

383
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,569
(mellow music)

384
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:31,073
(knocking)

385
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,450
(speaking foreign language)

386
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,633
It's me, Shalini.

387
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,170
Your fiancee, from India.

388
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,830
Wait, you're engaged?

389
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,910
No, we're not, she's nuts.

390
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,810
I've never seen her before in my life.

391
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,290
But I got a Master's degree
in English and cooking

392
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,680
all so I can make a good wife for you.

393
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,388
You cook and you speak English?

394
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,230
Well, great.

395
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,110
I'll hire you as my maid.

396
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,943
Get real.

397
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:56,710
The person I marry will be
on their way up, like Nicole,

398
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,510
not some fresh off the boatie like you.

399
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,543
Now, if you'll excuse us.

400
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:05,030
(melancholy music)

401
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,173
What's goin' on?

402
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,310
Did he take classes or
was he always this stupid?

403
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,513
Look, Rob.

404
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,650
I just, I'm moving up, so I can't be

405
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,875
with an assistant any more.

406
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,110
I'm sorry.
All right, everyone.

407
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,713
Outta here, now.

408
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,073
Namaste and get outta here.

409
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,430
Even though you're Indian at heart

410
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,960
you have become the
worst of what the world

411
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,163
knows Americans to be.

412
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,443
Thanks.

413
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,110
So, what you're saying
is that you put together

414
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,190
Nicole's campaign but let
Neil take all the credit

415
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,810
because you felt you owed him.

416
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,643
Yeah.

417
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:47,476
All right, prove it.

418
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:49,950
Neil's contract runs out in eight weeks.

419
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,670
You can replace him if
you bring me someone

420
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,400
who no one could ever imagine

421
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,060
could be an American
celebrity, a real challenge.

422
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,940
Someone...

423
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,253
Like her.

424
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,870
What, are you serious?

425
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,703
That's ridiculous.

426
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:06,150
She's not even American.

427
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,983
Or an actress.

428
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:07,816
Make her one.

429
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,373
Gary, I don't think that
she has any interest

430
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,990
in becoming a celebrity,

431
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,770
much less becoming American.

432
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,423
Nice guys don't get the corner office.

433
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,903
You want to replace Neil?

434
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:27,118
(lively music)

435
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:29,727
How you doin'?

436
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,260
Hi.

437
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,803
I'm really sorry about
what happened up there.

438
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:37,900
You need a ride or

439
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,873
do you need help with anything?

440
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,517
What is your good name?

441
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,160
I don't know if it's a good name.

442
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm Rob, Robert, Rob Shorwood.

443
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,340
Mine's Shalini.

444
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,187
Shalini Singh.

445
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:55,020
Oh.

446
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:59,235
Great to meet you.

447
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,173
So why doesn't Neelu like you?

448
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:06,600
(stammering)

449
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,260
I helped my girlfriend, my ex,

450
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,750
that girl Nicole, I helped
her become who she is

451
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,770
and now she and Neil are...

452
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,580
Anyway, were you leaving?

453
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,220
When are you leaving?

454
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,657
Oh, going back to India without Neelu

455
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:21,193
is not an option for me.

456
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,080
Well, you know, you still might

457
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,960
have a chance with him if

458
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,890
well, if you become the kind of woman

459
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,740
that he's attracted to, real
American celebrity material.

460
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,440
American.

461
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,634
I refuse to become anything
American, even as an act.

462
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:39,810
Right, right.

463
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,100
'Course.

464
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,933
Good luck.

465
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,689
(melancholy music)

466
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,663
Oy, oy.

467
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,713
You said you helped that
girl become what she is.

468
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,783
Will you help me?

469
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,653
Seriously?

470
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,200
I don't know, I mean,

471
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,772
it'd be a hundred years
before someone from

472
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:11,772
wherever you're from became
an American celebrity.

473
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,103
Unless, unless you were
to become more American.

474
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,940
If it will make me worthy of Neelu's love,

475
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,308
I will learn to be more American.

476
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:28,141
Okay.

477
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,183
This is good, this is good.

478
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:30,755
This is a start.

479
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:31,588
(lively music)

480
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,420
Uh, all right.

481
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,293
Do you have a place to stay?

482
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,000
I'd offer you my couch, but it's kinda--

483
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,740
Oh, girls don't stay with men

484
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,540
they're not married or related to.

485
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,093
Really?

486
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:45,480
You know what, we might be in luck.

487
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,980
I think the place next
door to me is looking

488
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,355
for a house sitter.

489
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,930
What is a house sitter?

490
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,250
Oh, well, it's when you get to stay

491
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,940
in somebody's nice place
and all their cool stuff

492
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,855
and you get to eat
their food and they pay.

493
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:58,020
They pay you for that?

494
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,490
It's a pretty good deal, right?

495
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,680
Taking care of other people's things

496
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,320
is kind of an American
cottage industry, you know.

497
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,633
House sitting, baby sitting, dog sitting.

498
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,073
No dogs.

499
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,170
I'm very scared of dogs.

500
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,140
Okay.

501
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,770
We'll cross dogs off the list.

502
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,603
How 'bout hot dogs?

503
00:20:12,603 --> 00:20:13,436
You like hot dogs?

504
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,333
What is a hot dog?

505
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Such big buildings.

506
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,633
This is bigger than my village.

507
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,823
I have never been to
somewhere like this before.

508
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,970
If my (mumbling) could
see me sitting in your car

509
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,440
right now, they would be so jealous.

510
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Are you making fun of Betsy?

511
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,273
Betsy?

512
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,670
Your car has a name?

513
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,880
My goat has a name.

514
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,140
Yeah, what's your goat's name?

515
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,200
Littly.

516
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
It's just in India, only
rich people have cars.

517
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,380
Indian cars.

518
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
Only movie stars have American cars.

519
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,020
Well, I guess if all else fails,

520
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,570
I could bring Betsy to India.

521
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,253
I could be the movie star.

522
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,490
You can't be a movie star in India.

523
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,050
Look at you.

524
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,870
Okay, so this is our
whole apartment complex.

525
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,750
There's like, an apartment back there.

526
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,583
This is where Blaine and I have lived

527
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,923
for the last couple years.

528
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,993
And you're gonna be here.

529
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,320
This is Mr. and Mrs. Fisher's house.

530
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,366
They're in Punta Gorda.

531
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:17,920
(mellow music)

532
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,283
Hey, this is your new place.

533
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,283
Oh, those are blinds.

534
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:47,010
(lively music)

535
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:08,686
(traffic zooming)

536
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:10,310
- [Blaine] So my grandmother
pulls up next to me

537
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,217
in this old car.

538
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:15,800
Hey, there she is.

539
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,260
Blaine, this is Shalini.

540
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,080
Shalini, my roommate, Blaine.

541
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,561
Hey, how you doin'?

542
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:21,748
(stammering)

543
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:24,860
(speaking foreign language)

544
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,860
Wow, listen, sit down,
please and you know,

545
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,943
have some breakfast.

546
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,943
So, what'll it be, hon.

547
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,330
Is your naan fresh?

548
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,127
I don't think so, considering
he died 15 years ago.

549
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,780
You know what, you know
what, why don't you

550
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,262
just bring her what we're having?

551
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,095
All right.

552
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:44,928
Coming right up.

553
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:45,761
Thank you.

554
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,963
I could actually go for some Indian curry.

555
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,360
Oh.

556
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,880
Well, in America the
only place to get curry

557
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,540
is an Indian restaurant.

558
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,840
Oh, can we go there for breakfast?

559
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,190
No, no, I really don't do curry.

560
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,290
Yeah.

561
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,930
He doesn't do spicy food, right.

562
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,650
Listen, listen, one time I
had a little, some spaghetti,

563
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,640
put a little Tabasco sauce on it, right--

564
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,050
Let's not relive it.

565
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,883
Is that all right?

566
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:09,762
Can we not?

567
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,465
All right, right.

568
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,715
Okay, Shalini from India.

569
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,260
I think we should start
by giving you a new name.

570
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,093
Are there any other names that you like?

571
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,795
Well, I love the name Sweetie.

572
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:26,910
Whoa, whoa, Sweetie?

573
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,030
Unh unh, Sweetie is not a name.

574
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,177
That's something that
you call out to a hottie

575
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:32,750
that you see on the street.

576
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,843
No, no, no Hottie is Sweetie's friend.

577
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,310
How 'bout a different relative, like,

578
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,320
the other side of the family.

579
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,690
Like...

580
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,400
Well, well, Baby's married to Bunny.

581
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,610
Their children are Lovely and Pretty

582
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,750
and Sweetie and--

583
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,040
Tweetie.

584
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,280
Very smart.

585
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,216
How did you know?

586
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:53,049
Forget it.

587
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,080
You know what, you're
officially kicked off

588
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,130
the naming committee.

589
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,913
What else?

590
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:57,746
How 'bout...

591
00:23:58,694 --> 00:23:59,527
Shallie.

592
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:01,194
Some people in India,
they call me Shallie.

593
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:02,194
That's good.

594
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:03,027
That's much better.

595
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,410
Shallie.

596
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,243
Shallie.

597
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,076
Shoal.

598
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,986
Shulie?

599
00:24:07,986 --> 00:24:09,986
Shulie, Sheila, Sheeley.

600
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,350
Shelley.

601
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,550
Shelley.

602
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,720
Shelley?

603
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,910
But that is not Indian.

604
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,990
Well, that way, Neil won't
think that you're one.

605
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,760
In fact, let's make her Hispanic.

606
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,370
(slow tempo playful music)

607
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,885
Shelley Picante.

608
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:28,760
You know what, 'cause I'm lookin',

609
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,593
you could be Mexican.

610
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,190
Yeah, yeah, or Puerto Rican.

611
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,300
South American.

612
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,510
Or, well wait.

613
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,510
She doesn't speak Spanish.

614
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,800
Because she's second generation,

615
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,010
and we won't have to worry about

616
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,613
the Hispanic accent, either.

617
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,560
Excuse me, what is a Hispanic?

618
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,100
Oh, you know.

619
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,970
Latin folks.

620
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,220
People that took my spot.

621
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,440
Where was your spot?

622
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,890
So cute.

623
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,760
Okay, Shelley Picante.

624
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,930
This is good, this is good.

625
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,870
Now, all we need is some
American clothes and

626
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,210
you're on your way.

627
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,043
(lively music)

628
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,590
Right, what's wrong with my
(speaking foreign language)?

629
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,810
Woman, you could wrap like, 25 Latina

630
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,823
chicks in your soma, oh, make that 50.

631
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,510
We'll go shopping later.

632
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,620
And you know what, is it
cool if we take your glasses?

633
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,908
But how will I see?

634
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:14,990
You ever heard of contact lenses?

635
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,916
No.

636
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,460
You know, we should probably
work on your accent.

637
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,090
Yeah, yeah, 'cause right
now, you sound like

638
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,280
Apu from the Simpsons and a
Hispanic Apu just won't work.

639
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,890
Well, I could imitate the
actors on American TV.

640
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,220
You know, one of my friends, she worked

641
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,460
for this outsource call
center jobs in Delhi.

642
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,330
They made her watch so much American TV,

643
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,894
now she speaks better
English than both of you.

644
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:35,477
(lively music)

645
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:45,567
Shrimpa.

646
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,308
Bob (mumbling).

647
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:49,141
Bobbie.

648
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:52,365
Downunder under.

649
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,607
I don't believe it anymore.

650
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:55,960
(mumbling)

651
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,793
That's shorts.

652
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,060
- [Rob] That looks great.

653
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,850
Wow, what a difference
a pair of contacts make.

654
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,180
So, how else did your friend train

655
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,670
for the outsourcing job?

656
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,190
Oh, they learnt all about America, mate.

657
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,183
Why are you talkin' like that?

658
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:12,570
Because you told me to
practice my new accent.

659
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,390
So, I sat up all afternoon and watched

660
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,117
this TV called Downunder Dundee.

661
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,600
No, no, that's Australian.

662
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,290
Your accent is really,
really bad Australian.

663
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,640
Shelly Picante who's
really Indian but speaks

664
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,810
with an Australian accent
that sound American,

665
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,070
this is just a trip.

666
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,030
All white people sound the same to me.

667
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,200
Tell me about it, sister.

668
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,540
We need to get to you
sound more midwestern.

669
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,835
You know, white bread.

670
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:35,960
I thought you were turning me Hispanic.

671
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,740
Hispanic is the new white bread,

672
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,970
just baked with a little salsa.

673
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,423
Try these on, Miss Picante.

674
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:45,580
(faint uptempo music)

675
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,880
Who are those for?

676
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Oh, well these are for me
and this is for my dad.

677
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,539
And my gr, no I want these, let go.

678
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:56,122
(mellow music)

679
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:01,897
(clearing throat)

680
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,127
Wow.

681
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:07,020
Well, you look hot.

682
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,580
Yeah, yeah, you look really cool.

683
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,280
But my knees are showing and people

684
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,187
will think I'm a loose girl, right?

685
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:14,940
No, in this town, what you're wearing

686
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,500
is a lot longer than what most
women are wearing nowadays.

687
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,333
- [Shelley] Oh?

688
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,166
- [Blaine] Yeah, most.

689
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,720
Okay, one says cool, one says hot.

690
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,070
Which one is it?

691
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,540
Cool or hot?

692
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,833
It's hot.
It's cool.

693
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:30,666
- [Blaine] It's hot.

694
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,827
- [Rob] It's cool.

695
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:32,720
(stammering)
It's really the same.

696
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,553
Yeah, same.

697
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,380
Hey, you know.

698
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,870
We should look at the DVDs.

699
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,600
I mean, if she's gonna be Hispanic--

700
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,450
She should see some Spanish movies.

701
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,730
Okay, ah, here we go, right here.

702
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,780
Here's one.

703
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,447
(speaking foreign language)

704
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,780
You're not speaking a
foreign language right now.

705
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,880
Do you speak Spanish?

706
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,660
Listen, I know what I'm
talking about, trust me.

707
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,666
No, no, no, the Y is a luh sound.

708
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,242
It's (speaking foreign language).

709
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:04,666
No, no, no.

710
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,180
The L makes a Y sound.

711
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,216
This one is E.

712
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:12,883
(speaking foreign language)

713
00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:17,798
Excellent.

714
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:19,377
What about this one?

715
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:23,044
(speaking foreign language)

716
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,690
Cyndi Lauper.

717
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:39,840
- [All] Cyndi Lauper.

718
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,215
All right, let's go check out.

719
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:45,740
(speaking foreign language)

720
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,314
(lively music)

721
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:51,147
(singing in foreign language)

722
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,550
- [Shelley] My dear Ma,
Daddy-ji, Littly and Happy.

723
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,810
I have some great news.

724
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,070
I have found Neelu and
everything is wonderful.

725
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,413
He takes me for long walks in the park,

726
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,890
buys me flowers and then,
in true Bollywood style,

727
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,590
we go and dance around trees.

728
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:18,007
(lively singing in foreign language)

729
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,290
You'll never believe the
things that I'm seeing here.

730
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,310
It's like living in a Hollywood movie.

731
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,000
Really.

732
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,790
Can you imagine, there are
no cows on their streets,

733
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,570
and the things they eat here.

734
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,810
They heat up their dogs, put it on a bun

735
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,186
and call it a hot dog.

736
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,019
Ew!

737
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:51,450
They speak funny, too.

738
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,893
Wonderful.

739
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,003
Wonderful.

740
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,880
You don't need glasses in America.

741
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,130
They have these magical
things they call lenses

742
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,140
and they have these special TV doctors.

743
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,080
They're called elastic surgeons.

744
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
They can stretch your rack.

745
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,070
With so few clothes, why
do I need a bigger rack?

746
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,970
You don't need my help.

747
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,930
- [Shelley] I knew I
don't have enough clothes.

748
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,710
I'm already making friends.

749
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,930
Two boys from next door, I mean, I mean,

750
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,910
two girls from next door.

751
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,950
We brought you these CDs to listen to.

752
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,399
They use them for,

753
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:23,986
hey, can you, we turn that off please?

754
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:25,220
What?

755
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,770
They use them for foreign
actors in the industry.

756
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,970
Thank goodness, because I
only have two months to go.

757
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,990
Two months for what?

758
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,723
The day I have to be at my
cousin's wedding with Neelu.

759
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,193
Wait a minute.

760
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:39,340
Your family doesn't know what's going on?

761
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,210
They think I found Neelu
and everything is perfect.

762
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,260
What happens when they find out

763
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,920
that everything is not perfect?

764
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,870
It won't matter then.

765
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,800
I'll be married to the
man of my family's dreams.

766
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,320
Okay, wait, time out.

767
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,800
If you're gonna put forth all this effort,

768
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,817
why not marry the man of your dreams?

769
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,760
I read there is no difference between

770
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,350
parents' and childrens' dreams.

771
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,100
My father picked him for me,

772
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,930
so we are meant for each other, see?

773
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:06,186
(playful music)

774
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:08,457
Yeah, I don't think Neil got the memo.

775
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,110
I know I don't have that body.

776
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,410
Nicole didn't have that body either

777
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,800
until she hit the gym.

778
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,230
Who is Jim?

779
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,230
Why did she hit him?

780
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,261
You wanna get this one?

781
00:31:24,261 --> 00:31:26,970
(lively music)

782
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,780
Hi, I'm Robert Shorwell
from Cantec Celebrity.

783
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,700
I called for Rocky.

784
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,890
- [Receptionist] Sure, I'll page him.

785
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,410
Rocky, front desk.

786
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,200
- [Shelley] I can really look like her?

787
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,067
Yeah, but you know what?

788
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:36,900
You don't want to look like a lollipop.

789
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,268
You know, a little tiny stick for a body

790
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:40,780
and a big old holly head.

791
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,355
[Receptionist On P.A.]
Rocky to the front desk.

792
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:43,930
- [Rocky] Excuse me.

793
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,840
- [Woman] Hey.

794
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,700
- [Rocky] Hey, Rob.

795
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,533
Hey, Rocky.

796
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
What can I do you for?

797
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,155
I want to have a body like her.

798
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:53,010
But I only have four weeks to do it.

799
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,620
Shelley's a new client.

800
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,830
You think you can work your magic on her?

801
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,340
I could try, but four weeks means

802
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,230
multiple private sessions.

803
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,210
Costs a couple grand.

804
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,043
Grand?

805
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:04,040
Meaning dollars?

806
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,510
No, grand meaning pesos.

807
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,930
Of course, dollars.

808
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,120
Oh, I don't have that much money.

809
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,056
Can you give me a discount
or something please?

810
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:12,360
This isn't a swap meet.

811
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,620
I don't do coupons.

812
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,710
I'm a celebrity trainer for God's sake.

813
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,600
Hey, ooh attitude.

814
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,433
Rob.

815
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:21,030
This is nuts.

816
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,290
I'm just a girl from some
little Indian village

817
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,970
who dreams to Bollywood films.

818
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,217
I don't have the face or the body or

819
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:28,600
even the money to do this.

820
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,100
Now, this might not be
a Bollywood film set,

821
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,240
but this is America, okay, and you can be

822
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,450
whatever you want to be, come on.

823
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,610
I decided not to go into the military

824
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,670
specifically because of boot camp.

825
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,810
What is this boot camp?

826
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,230
It's Blaine's military training

827
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,620
designed to make grown men weep.

828
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,990
Military training?

829
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,160
Women in my town, they
train to be good wives

830
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,420
and good mothers, not good
soldiers and all this.

831
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,020
Well, they do here.

832
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,310

00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,153

This is to mark both of their birthdays.

911
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,703
Let's go change.

912
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:39,900
I'm takin' you someplace special.

913
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:41,900
(lively music)

914
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,050
So this is the Dixie Fix,

915
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,290
the greatest country bar in L.A.

916
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,200
What's a country bar?

917
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,820
Well, it's a bar that plays country music.

918
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,093
Women don't go to bars.

919
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:53,594
They don't?

920
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:54,427
Not in my village.

921
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,470
Women don't dance in
public or drink alcohol.

922
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,840
It's considered really shameful.

923
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,299
I don't dance in public, either.

924
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:00,550
Well, you don't dance, period.

925
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,383
Shut up.

926
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:02,265
No, listen.

927
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,030
If you wanna learn about American culture,

928
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,270
this is the place to do it.

929
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,670
Okay, I won't dance and
I'll get a soft drink.

930
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,893

931
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,990

That's what I love about your culture.

940
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,798
I can do something just because I want to,

941
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:29,286
not because I have to.

942
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:30,119

referred to as ham before.

1093
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,300
(mumbling)

1094
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,220
What do Americans call it?

1095
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,830
Uh, let's see.

1096
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,580
Blaine, Blaine, she's
talking about her food.

1097
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,810
Shelley, hamburger's not actually ham.

1098
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,146
It's beef.

1099
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:47,340
(crashing)
Oh!

1100
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,923
I've been eating beef all this time?

1101
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,720
How can it be made of beef
when it's called hamburger?

1102
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,553
Oh!

1103
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:53,386
I don't know, why?

1104
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,590
What, what, what's the matter?

1105
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,000
We don't eat cows in my religion!

1106
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,300
Well, it's a little too
late for that, mama.

1107
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,610
Are you really that hungry?

1108
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,957
She doesn't like beef.

1109
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:04,790
(mellow music)

1110
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,915
Whoo.

1111
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:06,748
You know something?

1112
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:08,490
We may discriminate
against our own people,

1113
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,030
but we treat our animals right.

1114
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,320
We eat 'em all.

1115
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,820
We do.

1116
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,330
And then when we're done,
American men, in particular,

1117
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,550
we pull out a woman's magazine to catch up

1118
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,695
on some makeup issues, Rob.

1119
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:21,760
It's for the face makeover, dummy.

1120
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,040
I hope you know what you're doing, Rob.

1121
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,210
I've never really put on
this kind of makeup before.

1122

Really?

1123
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,027
- [Shelley] Mmm hmm.

1124
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:27,883
Well, how hard can it be?

1125
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:29,670

a Christmas tree.

He's right.

1142
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:12,380

We can't afford one.

1161
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,460
So, I invited two of them, Nick and Yuki

1162
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,700
to meet us at Georgina Smith's house.

are a lot more assertive,

more in charge.

00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,100
Now, if I had only taken
some acting lessons,

1224
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,857
I would actually have a
chance of making this work.

1225
00:46:53,857 --> 00:46:56,170
You know, reality TV changed all that.

1226
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,140
You don't really need talent
anymore to be a celebrity.

1227
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,270
You need buzz, and a good publicist.

Well, you got that one right, honey.

1229

00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:11,401
Yes, you can.

1235
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:12,234
Now, I should let y'all know

1236
00:47:12,234 --> 00:47:13,101
I never carved a turkey before.

Can I just say one thing?

1240
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,313
Up until I came to your country,

1241
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:22,240
I thought Americans were just
always out for themselves.

1242
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,280
Selfish, materialistic.

1243
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,413
Thank you all for teaching me differently.

1247
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:32,564
That was very, I was touched.

00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,030
How's the challenge going?

1254
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,329
Good, good.

1255
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:11,520
She's ready.

1256
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,060
All right, bring her in.

1257
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,120
If the makeover holds up, Neil's out

1258
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,820
and you can have his office.

1259
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,653
Listen, Gary.

1260
00:48:16,653 --> 00:48:18,473
I think I've changed my mind.

1261
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,550
You know, if having a better career

1262
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,223
means being a worse person,

1263
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,930
I don't want the corner office anymore.

1264
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,660
I think you're making a mistake.

1265
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,493
Maybe.

1266
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,303
Probably.

1267
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,850
But if I leave, can
Shelley stay a client here?

1268
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,010
Not if Neil stays on.

1269
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,590
He knows about our deal.

1270
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,590
He doesn't want anything to do with her.

1271
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,103
Well, I think he will.

1272
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:47,810
Wanna go to a party?

1273
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:48,910
Neil's gonna be there.

1274
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,993
Sure.

1275
00:48:50,993 --> 00:48:52,540
Before you become Neil's client,

1276
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,980
let's see if he recognizes you.

1277
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,490
Do we have invites to this shindig?

1278
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,230
This soiree, this bash, this hoedown.

1279
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,470
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

1280
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,180
Your American slang is terrific.

1281
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,340
No, we don't have tickets.

1282
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,600
How are we gonna get in?

1283
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,100
Crash it.

1284
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,560
Won't that damage Betsy?

1285
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,930
She'll be fine.

1286
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,763
This is Rob Shorwell.

1287
00:49:08,763 --> 00:49:09,997
I just wanted to make sure we're still on

1288
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:11,800
for those extras tonight.

1289
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,252
And they all have her head shot, right?

1290
00:49:13,252 --> 00:49:14,540
(phone ringing)
Can you hang on a second?

1291
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,870
Hello?

1292
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,870
Oh, the limo's here?

1293
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,713
Cool.

1294
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:19,900
We're on our way.

1295
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,250
Yeah, we'll be right there.

1296
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,050
Hey.

1297
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,320
I'm here.

1298
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,320
- [Shelley] Come in.

1299
00:49:27,688 --> 00:49:28,650
(lively music)

1300
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,803
Hey, why do they always sing
and dance in Indian movies?

1301
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,263
Run around trees.

1302
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,083
- [Shelley] That's how they
prove they love each other.

1303
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,900
I thought American dating was tough.

1304
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:45,592
(sexy jazzy music)

1305
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,547
I should change into something
more conservative, right?

1306
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,383
No, no.

1307
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:00,063
You look...

1308
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,896
Amazing.

1309
00:50:03,925 --> 00:50:05,111
(lively music)

1310
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:08,194
- [Woman] I will so crash this party.

1311
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:15,097
All right, come on.

1312
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:16,948
Stand over there.

1313
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:18,222
And you stand over there.

1314
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:19,055
I can't believe we're doing this.

1315
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:20,410
Want your 50 bucks or not?

1316
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,510
Come on.

1317
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,260
Now, Neil's almost here.

1318
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,310
When I go like this, yell Shelley's name,

1319
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,990
wave her head shot and
beg for autographs, okay?

1320
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,892
Wait, that's him.

1321
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,022
Get ready, get ready.

1322
00:50:30,022 --> 00:50:32,605
(lively music)

1323
00:50:34,572 --> 00:50:35,722
- [All] Shelley!

1324
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:36,639
(excited chattering)

1325
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:37,846
- [Woman] We love you Shelley.

1326
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:40,870
(excited chattering)

1327
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:43,453
(lively music)

1328
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,560
That was great, that was great.

1329
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,033
Hey, do we get our checks now?

1330
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,408
No, you don't get your checks now.

1331
00:50:55,408 --> 00:50:56,780
Come on.

1332
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,930
We gotta do this one more time.

1333
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,820
We have to do it again.

1334
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for the
director in AmeriBabe.

1335
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,930
That's him, that's him.

1336
00:51:06,924 --> 00:51:09,507
(lively music)

1337
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:13,148
- [Crowd] Shelley!

1338
00:51:13,148 --> 00:51:16,231
(excited chattering)

1339
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:18,131
- [Man] Shelley, can I get a picture?

1340
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:19,100
You believe all that attention?

1341
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,056
No, I can't.

1342
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:20,889
Who is that?

1343
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:22,385
- [Rob] Who is it?

1344
00:51:22,385 --> 00:51:24,235
That's Shelley Picante.

1345
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:25,800
Well, I've never heard of her.

1346
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,970
You've never heard of her?

1347
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,990
No, I haven't.

1348
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:29,740
She's on the top 50 list.

1349
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,120
- [Alan] Top 50 what?

1350
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,570
Top 50 list of hottest stars

1351
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,920
that you've never heard of.

1352
00:51:38,114 --> 00:51:39,110
- [Alan] Oh.

1353
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:39,943
Exactly.

1354
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:44,531
(uptempo music)

1355
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,760
Rob, this is so awkward.

1356
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,820
We don't know anybody here.

1357
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,870
Sure we do.

1358
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:54,900
Watch this.

1359
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,413
Hey, how are you?

1360
00:51:57,413 --> 00:51:59,614
Good, good, how are you?

1361
00:51:59,614 --> 00:52:00,801
Super.

1362
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:02,140
I haven't seen you in so long.

1363
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,560
I know.

1364
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,440
Now, have you met my dear friend.

1365
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,364
Of course.

1366
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:07,197
(laughing)

1367
00:52:07,197 --> 00:52:08,030
How are you?

1368
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,580
Great, good to see you again.

1369
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,620
Rob, can I?

1370
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,673
I thought you said you
didn't know anybody here.

1371
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:16,850
Well, I don't.

1372
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,414
I'm pretty sure they don't
know each other, either.

1373
00:52:18,414 --> 00:52:19,360
Why are they behaving
like they're best friends?

1374
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,960
Well, they do that just in case

1375
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,600
the other person is special.

1376
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,289
You're nobody in this town unless you know

1377
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:25,930
everybody who's a somebody.

1378
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,370
Do you guys know Shelley Picante?

1379
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,250
Shelley.

1380
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,260
Where do I know you from?

1381
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,093
I'm from India--

1382
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:32,926
Films.

1383
00:52:32,926 --> 00:52:34,460
Indie films.

1384
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,790
Independent films.

1385
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,389
I'm from India myself.

1386
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:42,200
I would have never guessed.

1387
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,880
In my previous life, honey.

1388
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,110
My spiritual healer told me that.

1389
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,870
Why don't you tell them everything

1390
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,403
that you've been up to?

1391
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,853
Oh, well.

1392
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,103
Rob.

1393
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:04,220
Neil, what are you doin' here?

1394
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,053
Who is she?

1395
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:06,984
Who?

1396
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,330
Oh, that's Shelly Picante.

1397
00:53:12,243 --> 00:53:13,180
I don't know if you've heard.

1398
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,630
I'm flying solo now.

1399
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,380
Shelley's gonna be my first client.

1400
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,113
She is gonna be huge.

1401
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,583
Yeah, right.

1402
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,416
(guests chattering)

1403
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,252
Was I wrong about Nicole?

1404
00:53:24,252 --> 00:53:26,773
(lively music)

1405
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:27,606
- [Man] Well, of course.

1406
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:29,440
I mean, your last film was fabulous!

1407
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,273
What was it again?

1408
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,676
Oh, it was the Spanish blockbuster.

1409
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,013
(speaking foreign language)

1410
00:53:35,013 --> 00:53:36,176
Yeah, Spanish blockbuster.

1411
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:37,530
She's Latin.

1412
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,130
Oh!

1413
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:39,963
Kissy kissy.

1414
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:40,796
(smooching)

1415
00:53:40,796 --> 00:53:42,610
Oh dear, car crash again?

1416
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,880
No, it's just a facelift.

1417
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,700
Oh, I just love your facelifts.

1418
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,133
You've got to give me your guy's number.

1419
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,270
Oh no, wait.

1420
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,680
That is my butt surgeon.

1421
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,764
Let's see.

1422
00:53:55,764 --> 00:53:56,640
Eyes.

1423
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,210
Tummy.

1424
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,620
Lips.

1425
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,093
There's the face guy.

1426
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,785
Excuse me.

1427
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:06,962
(lively music)

1428
00:54:06,962 --> 00:54:09,610
(laughing)

1429
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,680
Hi.

1430
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,783
I'm Neil Brar, Senior Executive Manager

1431
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,530
and Cantec Celebrity Management.

1432
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,121
Hi.

1433
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,109
I'm Shelley.

1434
00:54:18,109 --> 00:54:18,942
Shelley Picante.

1435
00:54:19,784 --> 00:54:21,634
Ah, Latina.

1436
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:22,820
Latina.

1437
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,260
It's perfect.

1438
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,450
There's a real need for
Latina actresses right now.

1439
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,143
In fact, we were looking
to add some to our roster.

1440
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,146
You speak Spanish?

1441
00:54:32,146 --> 00:54:35,813
(speaking foreign language)

1442
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:48,567
That's actually the only
two words I know, but...

1443
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:50,510
So, how would you feel about

1444
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,598
becoming a client of our company?

1445
00:54:53,598 --> 00:54:55,010
I'd really like that.

1446
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,660
Great.

1447
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,043
I would really love to
work on you, for you.

1448
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,731
Welcome aboard.

1449
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:05,314
(lively music)

1450
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,593
- [Rob] Did you have fun tonight?

1451
00:55:11,593 --> 00:55:13,490
Yeah, yeah I did.

1452
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,130
You know though, the more time I spend

1453
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:18,280
with Americans, the more I
miss people from back home.

1454
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,856
They're,

1455
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:21,730
they're not so superficial.

1456
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,240
They're more simple.

1457
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,197
My hometown, too.

1458
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:27,618
But you're American, like
the people were tonight.

1459
00:55:27,618 --> 00:55:30,213
I think the real America
lives well beyond Hollywood.

1460
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,393
Hey, hey.

1461
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,890
Look at the stars.

1462
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,570
This is really rare for L.A.

1463
00:55:39,156 --> 00:55:41,956
You know, Rob, when I was a little girl,

1464
00:55:41,956 --> 00:55:43,610
I gazed at the stars at night,

1465
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,160
and wondered if my soul mate in America

1466
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,760
looked at the same stars
I did and the deal was,

1467
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,653
if a star twinkled, it meant yes.

1468
00:55:53,097 --> 00:55:54,233
Did it twinkle.

1469
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,768
Always.

1470
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:59,240
(melancholy music)

1471
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,073
And uh,

1472
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,720
Neil

1473
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,817
was that soul mate?

1474
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:07,726
Yeah.

1475
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:11,040
How do you know?

1476
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,893
I mean, couldn't it be another American?

1477
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:18,683
Like who?

1478
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,556
I don't know, it could be anybody.

1479
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:23,006
He could be living in Kansas.

1480
00:56:24,018 --> 00:56:24,851
Kansas?

1481
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,190
Where's Kansas?

1482
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,033
It's far.

1483
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,590
It could be somebody from
the party tonight, or,

1484
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,043
or that trainer from the gym.

1485
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,327
No.
No.

1486
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:41,051
(melancholy music)

1487
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:41,968
Could be...

1488
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,063
Could be me.

1489
00:56:50,014 --> 00:56:51,020
(chuckling)

1490
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,113
No, you have more in common
with people from Mars.

1491
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,660
Just kidding, right?

1492
00:57:09,775 --> 00:57:10,608
I, uh,

1493
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,550
I always wondered what it would be like

1494
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:14,930
to kiss for the first time.

1495
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,440
You're 28 and you've
never been kissed before?

1496
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,767
(melancholy music)

1497
00:57:54,414 --> 00:57:56,400
What are we doing?

1498
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,300
You love Nicole.

1499
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,283
I love Neil.

1500
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:03,664
(door thudding)

1501
00:58:03,664 --> 00:58:06,581
(melancholy music)

1502
00:58:12,098 --> 00:58:14,230
(lively music)

1503
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,063
See, see?

1504
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:15,960
Right there.

1505
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,360
That should be, that should have been

1506
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,780
a penalty, right there, but
they don't call that stuff.

1507
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,613
- [Rob] When you say--

1508
00:58:20,613 --> 00:58:21,800
Monstrosity, yeah.

1509
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,800
If he, hey!

1510
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,633
Hey.

1511
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,740
Neil just called.

1512
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,280
The director for AmeriBabe wants to see me

1513
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,190
for a small role in the movie.

1514
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,330
That's amazing.

1515
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,163
This is, this is great.

1516
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:31,813
Why are you so bummed.

1517
00:58:31,813 --> 00:58:34,823
Because we have a huge problem.

1518
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,020
I told my family that
Neil's ready to marry me,

1519
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,330
but we can't go to Canada
for my cousin's wedding

1520
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,830
because he's super busy at work,

1521
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:42,663
and guess what?

1522
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:46,420
They're coming to Los Angeles.

1523
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,290
They're coming here?

1524
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,370
Mmm hmm.

1525
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,203
When?

1526
00:58:49,203 --> 00:58:50,330
In a few weeks.

1527
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,180
So, more of you?

1528
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,193
This is a problem.

1529
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,080
You don't understand, Blaine.

1530
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,670
They're coming to my wedding.

1531
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,010
Wait, wait.

1532
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,690
Your wedding?

1533
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,330
Yes, they have decided to kill

1534
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,820
two stones with one bird.

1535
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,160
Really?

1536
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,333
Does the groom know?

1537
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,770
You guys, I am so close to getting Neil.

1538
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:10,950
I don't want to ruin it now.

1539
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,870
So I figured, since my
parents have never met him

1540
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:14,760
as an adult, I'll just have somebody else

1541
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,670
pretend they're Neil.

1542
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,463
Shelley, Shelley, let's back up.

1543
00:59:17,463 --> 00:59:18,503
Hold on.

1544
00:59:18,503 --> 00:59:21,163
Who in their right mind
would do something like that?

1545
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:23,070
I don't know.

1546
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,320
I was thinking maybe...

1547
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,502
Oh no.

1548
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:31,672
(playful music)

1549
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:34,350
No, no.

1550
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:36,352
(laughing)

1551
00:59:36,352 --> 00:59:39,320
No, no, no.

1552
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,670
I am a white kid from Tennessee.

1553
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,720
There's nothing remotely Indian about me.

1554
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,910
Rob, we have fair skinned Indians.

1555
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,550
Unh uh.

1556
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:51,650
Indians love white skin, just not whites.

1557
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,040
Honestly, in arranged marriages,

1558
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,020
they're like, the first ones to go.

1559
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,120
Hmm, well remind me
never to move to India.

1560
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,140
Rob.

1561
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,000
Just as you taught me to be American,

1562
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,190
I can teach you to be Indian.

1563
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,540
She's completely lost it.

1564
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,360
It's only for one weekend.

1565
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,010
Then they go to Canada.

1566
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,660
It's my only chance of getting Neil back.

1567
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,195
Absolutely not.

1568
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:16,778
(lively music)

1569
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:21,120
All right, you also have to
grow your beard and mustache.

1570
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,973
I have to grow a beard, too?

1571
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:27,405
Can't I just use a fake one?

1572
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:28,738
No, you can't.

1573
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:33,561
(speaking foreign language)

1574
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:34,490
What is that?

1575
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,804
This is my Halloween
costume from last year.

1576
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:38,230
(mumbling)

1577
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,470
- [Shelley] What is Halloween?

1578
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,730
It's Blaine's one chance a year

1579
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,719
to make a complete idiot of himself.

1580
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:43,750
This is true, this is true,

1581
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,680
but this is the look that
we were going for, right?

1582
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,670
Actually, my religion has nothing to do

1583
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,480
with him or Islam or Arabs
or anything (mumbling).

1584
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,313
(mumbling)

1585
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:54,690
Yeah, for our wedding, Rob has to be Sikh.

1586
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,000
I'm very susceptible to colds.

1587
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,760
Oh, I had a question.

1588
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,180
Can I flirt with the bridesmaids
at an Indian wedding?

1589
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,420
No, we do not flirt in India.

1590
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,144
Well, do you do anything fun?

1591
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:08,120
All right, what else do I have to do?

1592
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,430
Every time you see my mom and dad,

1593
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:10,530
you have to touch their feet.

1594
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,630
It's a sign of respect.

1595
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa time out.

1596
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:16,970
What if their feet are dirty or smelly?

1597
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,610
Blaine, my family does
not have smelly feet.

1598
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,199
After 36 hours on a plane?

1599
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:23,640
Feel for you, man.

1600
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,940
Okay, and also, you have (mumbling).

1601
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,600
It's a very, very important part

1602
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,050
of the Indian wedding ritual.

1603
01:01:29,908 --> 01:01:34,320
(singing in foreign language)

1604
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,820
I can't pull this off.

1605
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,714
I mean, you've seen me dance,

1606
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:39,160
(stammering)

1607
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,023
I don't sing.

1608
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,450
Indians don't sing, either.

1609
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,400
They lip sync.

1610
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,700
At Indian weddings and in
Indian movies just like that.

1611
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:56,422

- [Rob] You all right?

1637
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:30,088
Yeah.

1638
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,832
(jet engine zooming)

1639
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:38,415
(lively music)

1640
01:03:39,628 --> 01:03:40,565
Daddy-ji.

1641
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:43,112
(speaking foreign language)

1642
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:44,386
Ma.

1643
01:03:44,386 --> 01:03:45,530
Littly.

1644
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,363
Happy.

1645
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:47,313
Where have you been?

1646
01:03:47,313 --> 01:03:48,300
Why are you at departures?

1647
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,280
We look for you up and down, up and down.

1648
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,492
(speaking foreign language)

1649
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:54,593
This is Neelu.

1650
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,005
Paprika.

1651
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:01,672
(speaking foreign language)

1652
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:08,263
You've changed.

1653
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:10,471
Before you were not so white in India.

1654
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,920
Oh.

1655
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,404
He's been using these great
skin whitening creams.

1656
01:04:15,404 --> 01:04:16,290
(speaking foreign language)

1657
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,253
I use it in India.

1658
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:20,570
But this one seems to be much better.

1659
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,720
You must give me the name for our Littly.

1660
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,670
I will share all of my
beauty secrets with you.

1661
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,180
Why are his eyes blue?

1662
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,013
Oh.

1663
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,851
Contacts.

1664
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:31,684
Huh?

1665
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:33,363
Lenses.

1666
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,270
Sorry to hear about your parents Patel.

1667
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,103
Terrible news.

1668
01:04:38,103 --> 01:04:39,833
Where is your older brother now?

1669
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,617
My older brother?

1670
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:45,340
(playful music)

1671
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:49,890
A very nice young man, older than me,

1672
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:50,723
but still nice.

1673
01:04:50,723 --> 01:04:51,556
Who is he?

1674
01:04:51,556 --> 01:04:52,610
Or where is he?

1675
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:55,149
He's at Neelu's apartment.

1676
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:56,736
Neelu's apart, my apartment.

1677
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:57,866
I will call him.

1678
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:58,699
Uh, no.

1679
01:04:58,699 --> 01:04:59,532
I'll call him.

1680
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:00,365
I will call.

1681
01:05:00,365 --> 01:05:02,198
No, I will call him.

1682
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,853
This belonged to Shalini's grandfather.

1683
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,253
Welcome to the family, son.

1684
01:05:11,452 --> 01:05:13,571
I have found him.

1685
01:05:13,571 --> 01:05:14,460
Shouldn't have bothered him.

1686
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,233
He's probably busy with his family.

1687
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:18,140
Nay, nay, he's single.

1688
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,180
Doesn't have a family.

1689
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,590
Single?

1690
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,490
That's auspicious.

1691
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:26,821
(lively vocalizing music)

1692
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:42,128
(speaking foreign language)

1693
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,440
Oh, he doesn't speak Punjabi anymore.

1694
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,450
Leh?

1695
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:48,610
How are you son?

1696
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,438
You were 10 years old
when we saw you last, eh?

1697
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:54,630
I think Neelu used up
all the skin bleach, huh?

1698
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,407
Not changed at all.

1699
01:05:56,407 --> 01:06:00,190
Still the same sweet boy
we used to call Pinky.

1700
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,980
I will not call you Parminder.

1701
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,220
I will call you Pinky only.

1702
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,712
Well, I would love it
if you called me Pinky.

1703
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,020
(chuckling)

1704
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,200
These people and their crazy names.

1705
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,190
I'm Happy.

1706
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,160
Happy you're Happy.

1707
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,430
I'm happy, too.

1708
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,553
You're not happy, I'm Happy.

1709
01:06:15,553 --> 01:06:16,840
You're Pinky.

1710
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,837
Yes, yes, I'm Pinky and you are Happy.

1711
01:06:20,837 --> 01:06:22,087
And I'm Littly.

1712
01:06:23,378 --> 01:06:24,440
Well.

1713
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,979
If I can be pink, you can be little.

1714
01:06:26,979 --> 01:06:27,829
Shut up, Pinky.

1715
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,340
Always blabbers when he gets excited.

1716
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,940
Oh, that's okay.

1717
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,610
Well, it's good for a boy to talk.

1718
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,210
Happy hardly talks these days.

1719
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:38,113
So, now, tell me.

1720
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,760
How much money you make every year?

1721
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,593
Ma.

1722
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:42,860
I'm sure he doesn't mind.

1723
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,693
Do you?

1724
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:44,526
No, not at all.

1725
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:46,620
I don't mind discussing
my salary with the world.

1726
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,820
I make about 30,000.

1727
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,350
Fantastic.

1728
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,520
Any hobbies?

1729
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,260
Yeah, working out.

1730
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,270
Cooking.

1731
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:55,790
Playing dress up.

1732
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,070
Cooking?

1733
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,413
Our Littly loves to eat.

1734
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,670
No kidding.

1735
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,010
Maybe you could make
her a nice Indian meal

1736
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,163
for your future bride.

1737
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,730
Excuse me?

1738
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,630
You probably don't remember,

1739
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:12,410
but when we engaged Neelu to Shalini,

1740
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,780
we also engaged you to Littly.

1741
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,823
So, it will be your wedding.

1742
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:20,490
(speaking foreign language)

1743
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,720
Welcome to the family, son.

1744
01:07:32,359 --> 01:07:34,942
(lively music)

1745
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,027
(speaking foreign language)

1746
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,023
Come, son.

1747
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:56,875
(singing in foreign language)

1748
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:16,269
(clapping)

1749
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:23,250
At this auspicious time,
we want you to share

1750
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,200
in another celebration.

1751
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,780
We have decided

1752
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,611
to marry our Littly to Pinky today.

1753
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:31,666
(excited chattering)

1754
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:33,916
(clapping)

1755
01:08:40,097 --> 01:08:42,520
I cannot marry Littly.

1756
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,450
In my culture, you don't marry someone

1757
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,283
that you're not in love with.

1758
01:08:45,283 --> 01:08:47,360
What do you mean, in your culture?

1759
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,173
Pinky.

1760
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:52,895
I'm not who you think I am.

1761
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:53,974
Eh?

1762
01:08:53,974 --> 01:08:56,508
(lively music)

1763
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:57,440
(crowd gasping)

1764
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,410
Oy!

1765
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:59,930
Oh, Lord.

1766
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,032
Lord.

1767
01:09:01,032 --> 01:09:03,210
(excited chattering)

1768
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:06,190
My name is Blaine and
I'm a friend of Neil's.

1769
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:07,584
When the real Pinky couldn't show up,

1770
01:09:07,584 --> 01:09:10,360
I stepped in and listen, Shelley,

1771
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,120
I wanna help you out, but not at the risk

1772
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,461
of breaking your sister's heart.

1773
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:15,398
(speaking foreign language)

1774
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:16,670
To think I almost married my daughter off

1775
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,102
to an American.

1776
01:09:18,102 --> 01:09:20,690
You could have never faced
any of our relatives any more.

1777
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,523
Oh my God.

1778
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:23,690
That would have been the end of my life.

1779
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:24,960
And what about you?

1780
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,397
Are you for real?

1781
01:09:26,397 --> 01:09:27,520
Ah!

1782
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,640
Sorry, (speaking foreign language).

1783
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,473
Had to make sure.

1784
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:30,370
Ma.

1785
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,430
I even told you it was a bad idea,

1786
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,445
and I was right, wasn't I?

1787
01:09:34,445 --> 01:09:37,053
But that's reason enough to celebrate.

1788
01:09:38,436 --> 01:09:40,600
You still are a good dancer, Neelu Patel?

1789
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,591
I practice every day.

1790
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:43,895
(mumbling)

1791
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:46,478
(lively music)

1792
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:50,144
- [Littly] Come, let's go.

1793
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:56,000
You still like extra spicy hot food?

1794
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,020
Good!

1795
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,373
I have a surprise for you!

1796
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,403
Chicken (mumbling) with extra hot chilis!

1797
01:10:08,356 --> 01:10:10,111
(speaking foreign language)

1798
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:12,778
(siren blaring)

1799
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:15,182
(lively beat music)

1800
01:10:15,182 --> 01:10:16,904
- [Rob] Oh, Lord.

1801
01:10:16,904 --> 01:10:17,737
Oh, Lord.

1802
01:10:19,459 --> 01:10:20,661
(knocking)

1803
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:21,494
Rob.

1804
01:10:21,494 --> 01:10:23,256
(toilet flushing)
(knocking)

1805
01:10:23,256 --> 01:10:24,089
Rob.

1806
01:10:25,237 --> 01:10:26,147
Are you okay?

1807
01:10:26,147 --> 01:10:27,433
I'm fantastic, how are you?

1808
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:29,200
Listen, I forget to tell you my parents

1809
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,220
ordered extra spicy food for Neil.

1810
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,150
It's just FYI.

1811
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:32,983
Thanks for the heads up.

1812
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:33,816
It's good to know.

1813
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:37,680
We need to pick a date
for the court wedding.

1814
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,830
But they just got married.

1815
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,972
Can you believe this country?

1816
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:46,670
They want every wedding, birth
and date to be documented.

1817
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,400
I know an auspicious date.

1818
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,873
We're here on the sixth
on our way back to India.

1819
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,708
(lively music)

1820
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,790
I cannot believe that we pulled that off.

1821
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,290
Hey, we should cancel that court date.

1822
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:03,410
I'll either be married to Neil,

1823
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:05,010
or on my way back to India by then.

1824
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,990
Listen, you need to worry
about your audition.

1825
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:08,250
What if we forget later?

1826
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,612
Then I will go and cancel it personally.

1827
01:11:10,612 --> 01:11:11,445
Personally?

1828
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:12,400
You won't call them.

1829
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,480
You won't email them.

1830
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,620
You won't text message.

1831
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,603
Yes, miss hip U.S.A., I promise.

1832
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,000
Rob, thank you so much for everything.

1833
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,390
Of course, except for the curry,

1834
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:23,783
I'd marry you again in a heartbeat.

1835
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:26,103
What?

1836
01:11:27,845 --> 01:11:30,428
(lively music)

1837
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,210
Okay, what we're looking for today is

1838
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:42,283
what AmeriBabe means to
you in your own words.

1839
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,746
And, action.

1840
01:11:45,746 --> 01:11:48,554
AmeriBabe is the best.

1841
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,985
How was that?

1842
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:52,750
Take it a little bit further.

1843
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:55,923
She's um, like ice cream.

1844
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:57,990
All right, thank you.

1845
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,476
Is there a script for this?

1846
01:12:01,476 --> 01:12:04,050
(lively music)

1847
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:07,733
We're really leaning more
towards in your own words.

1848
01:12:10,524 --> 01:12:12,490
Yeah, but can I see the script?

1849
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,547
AmeriBabe is...

1850
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:20,149
Cool.

1851
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:24,920
- [Alan] And?

1852
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,753
And,

1853
01:12:26,753 --> 01:12:27,753
AmeriBabe is

1854
01:12:29,807 --> 01:12:30,640
hot.

1855
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,350
Shelley Picante.

1856
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,500
Shelley Picante.

1857
01:12:34,422 --> 01:12:35,255
Have we met?

1858
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,523
No.

1859
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,230
You were at the party the other night.

1860
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:44,170
Yeah, I remember, there
were people mobbing you

1861
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:45,849
to get your autograph.

1862
01:12:45,849 --> 01:12:46,682
Yes!

1863
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,537
Yes, she is, hot like Picante.

1864
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:54,780
Thank you so much for coming
to see us today, really.

1865
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:58,370
Oh, thank you, I really,
I really appreciate it.

1866
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,642
Okay, bye.

1867
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:01,060
(lively music)

1868
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,820
We're replacing Nicole Westham.

1869
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,220
But they all sucked.

1870
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:07,570
Shelley Picante is where the fire isn't.

1871
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,780
She's on the top 50 list.

1872
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,650
Of what?

1873
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,550
I've never heard of her.

1874
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:12,383
Exactly.

1875
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,061
You're brilliant.

1876
01:13:16,061 --> 01:13:18,728
(phone ringing)

1877
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,720
Hello?

1878
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,813
What kind of Latina magic did
you work at that audition?

1879
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,688
I got a role in AmeriBabe?

1880
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:34,460
You got a role, you got a role, all right.

1881
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,730
The director is replacing Nicole

1882
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:40,033
and you, my dear, are his new lead.

1883
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,060
We're gonna celebrate.

1884
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,180
Be ready in an hour.

1885
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:55,257
(engine grumbling)

1886
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:58,273
(tires squealing)

1887
01:13:58,273 --> 01:14:00,030
What are you doin' out here?

1888
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,010
Have you seen this?

1889
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:01,867
I have.

1890
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:02,700
- [Rob] Have you seen this?

1891
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,533
I have.

1892
01:14:03,533 --> 01:14:04,366
This is unbelievable!
I know, I know.

1893
01:14:04,366 --> 01:14:05,199
We gotta celebrate.
I know.

1894
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,032
- [Rob] Blaine is waiting for us--

1895
01:14:06,032 --> 01:14:06,865
I can't.

1896
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,320
I'm having lunch with Neil.

1897
01:14:10,936 --> 01:14:11,769
Okay.

1898
01:14:12,678 --> 01:14:15,720
(melancholy music)

1899
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,863
We'll catch up later.

1900
01:14:18,893 --> 01:14:21,310
(tires squealing)

1901
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:24,227
(melancholy music)

1902
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,250
- [Neil] So, how does it feel?

1903
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,290
I can't believe it.

1904
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,170
I mean, just yesterday--

1905
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:33,060
That's why they call it
an overnight success.

1906
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,580
Takes hard work to reach the top here.

1907
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:37,003
It's even harder to stay there.

1908
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,250
That requires strategy.

1909
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,240
Like, you can't be nice anymore.

1910
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,710
You're not serious, Neil.

1911
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:46,540
Bad behavior creates scandal.

1912
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:48,630
Scandal creates controversy.

1913
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:50,683
Controversy creates publicity.

1914
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,445
And publicity ups your price.

1915
01:14:54,445 --> 01:14:57,010
(melancholy piano music)

1916
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,520
Is that all that matters to you?

1917
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,300
Money and this business?

1918
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,290
'Course not, sweetheart.

1919
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,020
My clients matter to me.

1920
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,730
Is that why you dumped me in a heartbeat?

1921
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,070
What about all the promises you made to me

1922
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:09,063
about us being together forever?

1923
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,593
Get real, Nicole.

1924
01:15:13,452 --> 01:15:15,860
The person I marry will
be on their way up.

1925
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,330
Like Shelley, not a has-been like you.

1926
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:20,745
Now, if you'll excuse us.

1927
01:15:20,745 --> 01:15:23,078
(splashing)

1928
01:15:25,685 --> 01:15:28,018
I hate it when they do that.

1929
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,257
I can't believe you just
broke up with Nicole.

1930
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:33,750
You don't break up with
someone you were never with.

1931
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,500
Which reminds me, what was
Rob doing at your place?

1932
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,438
He lives there.

1933
01:15:37,438 --> 01:15:38,720
We're friends.

1934
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,810
Okay, rule of thumb.

1935
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:42,270
If someone can't help
you get ahead in life

1936
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:45,860
or make you any money,
they're useless to you.

1937
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,434
Useless?

1938
01:15:47,434 --> 01:15:49,990
What if they're nice?

1939
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,923
Nice doesn't pay the bills, Shelley.

1940
01:15:54,181 --> 01:15:56,431
(knocking)

1941
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:00,850
- [Rob] Hi.

1942
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:01,720
Laundry?

1943
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,930
Uh, packing.

1944
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,350
Packing?

1945
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:05,413
I'm moving.

1946
01:16:05,413 --> 01:16:07,020
Goin' back home.

1947
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:07,853
What?

1948
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:09,880
Why?

1949
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,140
I kinda feel like my job's done.

1950
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:12,973
It's all right.

1951
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:14,480
We got what we wanted.

1952
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,070
And knowing Neil, you guys'll be married

1953
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,460
by the end of the week.

1954
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:21,040
I kinda feel like there's not
much here for me, anymore.

1955
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,090
Actually, there is.

1956
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:24,920
Neil broke up with Nicole.

1957
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,560
Oh, really?

1958
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,190
Wow, thanks.

1959
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:29,023
Think I'll pass.

1960
01:16:31,023 --> 01:16:33,170
(melancholy music)

1961
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:35,200
But, isn't that what you wanted, Rob?

1962
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,510
- [Rob] Oh, no, careful what
you wish for, blah, blah, blah.

1963
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,880
So what do you want?

1964
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,713
Doesn't matter, Shelley.

1965
01:16:40,713 --> 01:16:41,980
This was never about me.

1966
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,980
You're happy, right?

1967
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:45,155
Yeah, I think so.

1968
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,327
So, when are you leavin'?

1969
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,440
Oh, don't worry.

1970
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,370
I'll finish what I started.

1971
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,710
I'll be here when your parents get back

1972
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:55,453
and I'll take off when they go to India.

1973
01:16:58,687 --> 01:17:00,700
Will you give me your address?

1974
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:04,726
I don't think it's a good idea.

1975
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:07,643
(melancholy music)

1976
01:17:09,022 --> 01:17:09,900
David, don't test me.

1977
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,960
You know as well as I do that Shelley's

1978
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,253
quote is one million.

1979
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,113
But we'll take half a mil, goodbye.

1980
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,870
Oh, if you married me,
my little chili pepper,

1981
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:22,053
we would be Hollywood's power couple.

1982
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,150
Gloria, will you fax Ramson
Studios Shelley's contract

1983
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,378
for half a mil.

1984
01:17:27,378 --> 01:17:29,666
[Woman On Speaker] Gloria's
at lunch, Mr. Brar.

1985
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:32,249
All right, I'll do it myself.

1986
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:36,626
(melancholy music)

1987
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:53,030
(moves into lively music)

1988
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:55,100
How long have we known
that Shelley Picante's

1989
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,327
real name is Shalini Singh?

1990
01:17:57,327 --> 01:17:58,610
[Woman On Speaker] From day one, Mr. Brar.

1991
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,443
Is there a problem?

1992
01:17:59,443 --> 01:18:00,363
Any other day, yes.

1993
01:18:01,704 --> 01:18:03,253
Today, I'm feeling lucky.

1994
01:18:04,798 --> 01:18:08,465
(speaking foreign language)

1995
01:18:19,693 --> 01:18:21,943
(knocking)

1996
01:18:30,092 --> 01:18:32,060
Don't know if I ever can
make up for all the pain

1997
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:35,123
I've caused you, but I can certainly try.

1998
01:18:37,229 --> 01:18:39,323
(speaking foreign language)

1999
01:18:39,323 --> 01:18:40,483
Shalini Singh.

2000
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,150
Will you marry me?

2001
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,270
Neil.

2002
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:47,103
- [Daddy-Ji] What's going on?

2003
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:48,344
Why are you calling him Neil?

2004
01:18:48,344 --> 01:18:50,210
(mumbling) Neil's right here.

2005
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:51,123
That's not Neil.

2006
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:52,893
I'm Neil.

2007
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:55,670
That's Robert Shorwell.

2008
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,840
He is, was my assistant

2009
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,873
until I fired him.

2010
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,300
Okay, let's not get excited.

2011
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,603
I am Rob, Robert Shorwell.

2012
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,108
I am not Indian.

2013
01:19:11,108 --> 01:19:12,500
(speaking foreign language)

2014
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,493
The relatives will have
a field day with this.

2015
01:19:14,493 --> 01:19:15,490
(speaking foreign language)

2016
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,670
Is anyone who they say
they are in this country?

2017
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,503
Daddy-ji.

2018
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:19,910
It's not really his fault.

2019
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:20,787
This was all my idea.

2020
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:22,720
No, it wasn't.

2021
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,850
He made a bet with our owner that if he

2022
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,253
could Americanize Shalini,

2023
01:19:27,368 --> 01:19:28,473
he could have my job.

2024
01:19:31,073 --> 01:19:31,940
(melancholy music)

2025
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:32,893
That's not true.

2026
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,050
My poor, simple daughter.

2027
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,930
Ruined by this American.

2028
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,070
Was it all a lie?

2029
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:49,458
No, no, I mean, it started out that way

2030
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:50,840
(stammering)

2031
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,933
sorry I lied.

2032
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:55,161
It's just I,

2033
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,993
I wanted so badly to
make something of myself,

2034
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:00,683
you know?

2035
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,330
Wasn't 'til I started
spending every single day

2036
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:07,030
with you that I finally felt
like it became something.

2037
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:11,283
I don't want to be Neil.

2038
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:14,950
And Americanized or not, you're the most

2039
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:17,205
beautiful person that I know.

2040
01:20:17,205 --> 01:20:20,122
(melancholy music)

2041
01:20:21,508 --> 01:20:24,341
Shalini, I am so in love with you.

2042
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,860
Leave right now!

2043
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,500
You have ruined enough lives!

2044
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,310
- [Rob] Talk to Gary.

2045
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,428
He knows the truth.

2046
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:36,095
(speaking foreign language)

2047
01:20:43,532 --> 01:20:46,199
(uptempo music)

2048
01:20:48,069 --> 01:20:49,696
We are truly cursed!

2049
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:51,779
Don't just stand there.

2050
01:20:57,013 --> 01:21:00,680
(speaking foreign language)

2051
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,720
I'm not going back to India, Ma.

2052
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,090
I love Rob.

2053
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,366
I believe him.

2054
01:21:36,366 --> 01:21:38,616
(smacking)

2055
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,110
Daddy-ji, please say yes.

2056
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:43,970
Then go.

2057
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:46,600
I'll pretend one of my
daughters has died today.

2058
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,320
Oh, God, how will we face the neighbors

2059
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,363
when we get back?

2060
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:52,160
What to do with her now?

2061
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,330
I'll marry her.

2062
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,494
Really?

2063
01:21:54,494 --> 01:21:57,740
You do that, knowing she
married someone else?

2064
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,810
What can I say?

2065
01:21:58,810 --> 01:21:59,643
I'm a nice guy.

2066
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:01,780
We'll get her a divorce.

2067
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:02,990
I know a really good divorce lawyer.

2068
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:04,900
I've used him many times.

2069
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,733
Eh?

2070
01:22:05,733 --> 01:22:06,913
For friends, I mean.

2071
01:22:06,913 --> 01:22:09,133
I don't know how to thank you, Patel.

2072
01:22:10,235 --> 01:22:11,748
(speaking foreign language)

2073
01:22:11,748 --> 01:22:13,386
If you knew him the way I know him,

2074
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:14,862
you would never want me to marry him.

2075
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,890
I don't care what you know.

2076
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,880
He's an Indian and he's a Sikh.

2077
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,093
He's willing to marry you in
spite of your shameful actions.

2078
01:22:22,093 --> 01:22:26,051
(speaking foreign language)

2079

(melancholy music)

2080
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,040
I thought you said no price is too high

2081
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,883
to see a smile on your child's face.

2082
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,740
Daddy-ji, can I at least tell you

2083
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,688
what I just found out?

2084
01:22:43,688 --> 01:22:46,605
(melancholy music)

2085
01:22:52,142 --> 01:22:54,975
(traffic zooming)

2086
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:59,394
- [Man On P.A.] Neil
Brar and Shalini Singh.

2087
01:22:59,394 --> 01:23:02,610
Hey, Neil and Shalini won't be here.

2088
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,500
I'm here to cancel it.

2089
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,380
Okay.

2090
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,420
Oh, that won't be necessary.

2091
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,630
What are you doing here?

2092
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:08,770
Getting married.

2093

2094
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,638
What about your family?

2095
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:13,280
Oh, hello.

2096
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,820
Hello, Rob.
