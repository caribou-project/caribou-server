All right, Chloe Turner,

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,460
what's keeping you and me
here on a Saturday?

19
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:04,433
Dr. Andrea,

20
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:05,433
the Right whale samples

21
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,433
came in with the counts,

22
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,810
and I couldn't wait
until Monday to see.

23
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,467
Contaminants are down 40%
from last year's specimens.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
That's good news.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,734
And there's a healthy-looking
amount of blubber here, too.

26
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,700
What are our counts this year?

27
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,433
We're up
an additional six whales.

28
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,166
Six? Wow.

29
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,300
Which means

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,776
our food-conservation efforts
are working...

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,200
In the marine-protected area
that you established.

32
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,600
It would be so cool
to see it in person.

33
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,100
Conduct the count,
collect the samples.

34
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,066
Maybe next year.

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Maybe next week.

36
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:34,710
There's an exciting opportunity

37
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:36,266
on the other side
of the country.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,266
We have a research grant

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,233
that allows
one of our Ph.D. students

40
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:39,700
to study
the Orca whale migration

41
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:40,934
in the Pacific Northwest.

42
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,300
This is actually
really impressive.

43
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,433
It is.

44
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:45,710
You are my first choice
for the program.

45
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:46,467
Me?

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,567
Oh, I don't know
anything about them.

47
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,266
But you're wildly curious, Chloe,

48
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,600
It would give me insight

49
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:53,433
into a whole new species
of whales.

50
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,087
And the more we know
about the Orcas...

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
the better
we can protect them.

52
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:57,600
Exactly.

53
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:58,967
And I think this trip

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,609
could give you
the field experience you need

55
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:01,767
to nail down your thesis

56
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,033
and maybe even present you

57
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:03,934
with a discovery

58
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,109
that would inspire you to apply

59
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,613
for the National
Doctoral Scholarship.

60
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,533
That's the most competitive
award in the country.

61
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,147
I'm more likely
to get drafted by NASA

62
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,240
than get that scholarship.

63
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,767
You will never know
if you don't apply.

64
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,776
The research study trip
is Monday to Sunday.

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
This Monday?

66
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,734
I was supposed to be moving in

67
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,433
with my boyfriend, Marcus,
this weekend.

68
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,776
Oh, I didn't know
you had a boyfriend,

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,109
you spend so much time
in the lab.

70
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,367
Yeah, that's the thing...

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,567
we're both Ph.D. students,

72
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,066
and we hardly ever
see each other.

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,266
Honestly, I thought
we were growing apart,

74
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,867
but...

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,142
he said he wanted to talk to me,

76
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,533
and he seemed really excited,

77
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,533
and then I saw
a receipt in his car

78
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,667
for a key cutter

79
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,834
next to this little envelope
with my name on it.

80
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:46,000
That's very exciting, Chloe.

81
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,509
Well, if you change your mind,
let me know soon.

82
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,734
Thank you, Professor.

83
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,667
And keep up the good work.

84
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,667
Hey, you.

85
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,667
Marcus!

86
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
How are the fish today?

87
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,900
- It's mammals.
- Right. Sorry.

88
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,300
How are the big fish today?

89
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,633
We got impressive lab results

90
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,934
and this year's count
is showing big numbers.

91
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:06,934
Hey.

92
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,133
Love big numbers.
The bigger the better.

93
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,767
In fact,
I got the biggest numbers

94
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,433
in our mock
Wall Street session today.

95
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,433
That's great!
Congratulations.

96
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:14,734
Why, thank you.

97
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,376
Yeah, it looks like we're both
exceeding expectations.

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
Me in Economics

99
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,800
and you in...

100
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,100
Marine Mammar...

101
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,300
mammanimal?

102
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:25,433
Ooh.

103
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,533
No. Mammalogy.

104
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,433
Ah, right.

105
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:28,600
Okay.

106
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,433
Time for...

107
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:31,576
"Sandwich-split Saturdays."

108
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
My favorite day.

109
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,843
You know, I actually
wanted to talk to you

110
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:35,867
about Saturdays.

111
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,266
- They're great...
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,734
But we're both so busy

113
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:39,867
that, outside of that,

114
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:41,009
we don't get to see each other
nearly enough,

115
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:43,233
so, I was thinking...

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
maybe...

117
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,042
it's time
we start sharing some space.

118
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,567
What... what is this?

119
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:52,600
Open it.

120
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,533
I really have no idea
what it could be.

121
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,266
Keys!

122
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
To our new place!

123
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,233
Oh, I can't wait to show you.

Support us and become VIP member 
to remove all ads from www.OpenSubtitles.org

125
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,066
Welcome home.

126
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,266
This is an office.

127
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,767
Yeah! Our office.

128
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,033
It's right between

129
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,646
my lecture hall
and your research lab.

130
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,547
I can honestly say
I wasn't expecting this.

131
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,934
Hey, look,

132
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,967
I know that this is
a big commitment, okay,

133
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,367
but I don't know,

134
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,340
I feel like we're ready
to take that next step.

135
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,133
I don't think
we're on the same page.

136
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:36,700
Exactly. Exactly!

137
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,176
Which is why
we can finally find ourselves

138
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,033
in the same place,
at the same time,

139
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,166
in between classes.

140
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,233
I don't know,

141
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,509
I think maybe
I need some time to...

142
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,367
Some time?

143
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,033
Well, how about
we reschedule for...

144
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,233
for Monday?

145
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,700
I'm gonna be
in the Pacific Coast

146
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,433
for a research trip on Monday.

147
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,333
Oh, you are?

148
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,166
Yeah. Yeah, the opportunity
just came up,

149
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
it's only a week,
and then I'll be back for...

150
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,000
For the big move-in?

151
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,507
Sure, yes.
We'll talk then.

152
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:04,533
Bye.

153
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,167
Bye. See you later.
I'm glad you love it.

154
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,967
- Hi, Dr. Andrea.
- Oh, hi, Chloe.

155
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,509
Is the research trip
still available?

156
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,834
It is,

157
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,009
and it's all yours
if you want it.

158
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,900
Yes. More than anything.

159
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Oh, no.

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay...

161
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,667
Maybe it's not too far to walk.

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,100
Perfect.

163
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:46,967
Ah-hah!

164
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,033
We are going old school.

165
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,767
Okay...

166
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:15,033
Let's see here...

167
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,500
Oh.

168
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Oh!

169
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,667
You all right?

170
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,700
Yes.

171
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:35,867
Fine.

172
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
It should be illegal

173
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,409
to rent these things
to tourists around here.

174
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,553
Excuse me, I'm not a tourist,

175
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,266
I am a scientist,

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,233
and I asked for a smart car.

177
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,667
Not so smart after all.

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,567
Oh... you're funny.

179
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm headed to Mary's B&B
in Cable Cove.

180
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,367
Do you have any idea
how far away that is?

181
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,600
I do.

182
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,843
If you call a tow truck,
it will be a couple of hours,

183
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,907
but I can get you there
in five minutes if you want.

184
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,166
Yeah, if you insist.

185
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,967
I insist.

186
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,934
Need a hand?

187
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,066
Thank you.

188
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,133
- Yes.
- Good?

189
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,100
- So...
- I'm Chloe.

190
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,500
Sorry, let's try that again.

191
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,567
I'm Ben Winters, and you are?

192
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,767
I'm Chloe Turner.

193
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,767
Chloe?

194
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
The scientist.

195
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,100
Uh, technically,
Chloe the Ph.D. student.

196
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,233
Oh.

197
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:44,700
Well then, Dr. Chloe Turner.

198
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,166
No. Not yet.

199
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,900
I'm studying Marine Mammalogy
at Miami Central College.

200
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, so you're here
for the Orcas.

201
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,900
I spent the whole flight
reading about them.

202
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,166
I cannot imagine

203
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,776
what it would be like
to see one in real life.

204
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,560
You've never seen
an Orca in the wild before?

205
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,500
No.

206
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,333
Just the 800 times
I watched "Free Willy".

207
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:02,333
As a kid.

208
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:03,834
Right. Of course.

209
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,633
You know, something tells me
you're gonna love Cable Cove.

210
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,633
Thank you for the lift.

211
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:26,767
No problem.

212
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:28,147
I'll call the tow-truck company,

213
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,266
see if I can't get you
a refund for the rental.

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,509
You sure I can't give you
a hand...

215
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,400
Oh, no, no, no...

216
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,533
Oh...

217
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,600
What did you say
your name is again?

218
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,367
Ben Winters.

219
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,433
You let me go on about whales
that whole time

220
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:42,643
and didn't tell me you have

221
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,300
an entire business
dedicated to them?

222
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,000
I liked hearing you
talk about them.

223
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,509
If you need anything,
don't be afraid to knock.

224
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,700
Pretty sure I'll be fine.

225
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,400
Right, a scientist
not a tourist.

226
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,533
You got it.

227
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,233
- Bye.
- See ya.

228
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,166
Hello, friend!

229
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,133
Seal! Seal!

230
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,300
Hello!

231
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,700
Oh!

232
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,467
I'm gonna love it here!

233
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:32,467
Oh! Hi!

234
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,467
Hi.

235
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm Chloe Turner,
just checking in.

236
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:37,500
Chloe...

237
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,667
Chloe?

238
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,233
Oh, you're the student
from Miami!

239
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:42,367
Welcome!

240
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,467
I'm Mary.

241
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm just so tickled

242
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,109
you've come all this way
to see our whales.

243
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,500
Not just see them,
I'm here to study them.

244
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,333
Well, what type of research
are you doing?

245
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:53,033
I'm examining
the Orcas' migratory behaviors,

246
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,476
hopefully determining
any patterns

247
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,109
that would help us
continue to protect them.

248
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,276
Well, that's what
we're all about

249
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,367
here in Cable Cove.

250
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,633
I am going to give you
my favorite cabin.

251
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,867
It's right on the ocean.

252
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,533
I'll meet you right out there.

253
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,900
Oh, okay.

254
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:12,967
I have to say,

255
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,166
I think this is

256
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,242
the nicest bed and breakfast
I have ever stayed in.

257
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,300
I'm so glad you like it!

258
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,200
Wait till you see
the rest of this place.

259
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,233
Oh, my goodness!

260
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,433
Wow.

261
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:38,500
You are gonna love this cabin.

262
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,166
Mary, I already do.

263
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,576
Are you sure
I can't take your bag?

264
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Yes. Thank you.

265
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,333
And don't worry
about your shoes.

266
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,900
It's very homey here.

267
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,867
Come on in.

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,367
It's so pretty in here.

269
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,533
Should be all warmed up
in here for you.

270
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,934
It's perfect.

271
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,200
Wow.

272
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,433
I never get tired of that view.

273
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,700
Yeah, I wouldn't either.

274
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,800
So, breakfast is served
every morning at the big house

275
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,066
from 6 to 9.

276
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
And there's a fresh pot
of coffee on all day,

277
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,343
so you can come up anytime.

278
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,900
Oh, thank you, Mary.

279
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,567
I'm gonna get out of here
and let you settle in.

280
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,934
Oh!

281
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,600
No, no, no.
Where's the camera?

282
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,367
Okay, let's go.

283
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,533
Oh!

284
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,333
Sorry, sorry!

285
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:27,667
- Oh!
- Okay.

286
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,967
- Hey.
- Um...

287
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,000
- Well, please.
- No, I insist.

288
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,333
Okay.

289
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:35,800
You know what, that feels weird.

290
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:36,943
- You should...
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

291
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:37,967
Yeah.

292
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,567
Hey, Sammy.

293
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:54,633
Shoot!

294
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,407
Is what you should've done
10 seconds ago.

295
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,633
That is so helpful.

296
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:58,834
Thank you for the tip.

297
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,500
Yeah, no problem.

298
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,673
I wouldn't worry about it.

299
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,033
Orcas are
notoriously camera-shy...

300
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,033
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,367
Where are you going?

302
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
To my boat!

303
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,200
Gotta catch up to the pod!

304
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,467
Excuse me. Pardon me.

305
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,800
You've got a boat?

306
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,200
You've got a boat.

307
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,400
I sure do.

308
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,400
Here she is.

309
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,000
Wow, and you're going
to pilot it?

310
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,300
Mm-hmm.

311
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,440
And you know what you're doing?

312
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:27,800
Yes. Just...

313
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,134
checking out the old bow here.

314
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,367
That's the stern.
Bow's up front.

315
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,633
I know that.

316
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,100
I was looking at it from here.

317
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,380
So you've done this before?

318
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,066
Yeah.

319
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,367
Great.

320
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,900
So you've got a full tank,

321
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:41,900
life-vest,

322
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:42,900
flares,

323
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,100
bail bucket...

324
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,943
Yeah. I'm sure all those things
are here somewhere.

325
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,633
And you've definitely checked

326
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:49,266
the nautical forecast,
wind speeds?

327
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:51,300
Great.

328
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:54,066
Well, if you need anything...

329
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,440
Okay. I know where to find you.

330
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,767
Thanks so much.

331
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:58,834
Great.

332
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:01,900
Actually, what is a bail...

333
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,233
-bucket.

334
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,900
You are lucky
you were still tied up.

335
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,533
I did not know
the ocean would be so cold.

336
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,633
You're not in Miami
anymore, Chloe.

337
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,400
I know,
and now I've lost a whole day.

338
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,133
Day's not over yet,

339
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,834
you just need a little guidance.

340
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,576
You know what, I'm gonna
give Ben Winters a call...

341
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,467
I don't think
that's a good idea.

342
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,066
Well, Ben knows
more about the Orcas

343
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,300
than anyone in Cable Cove.

344
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,433
Yes, I'm sure he does,

345
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,447
but he has offered to help me
a number of times,

346
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,643
and I've told him
that I don't need his help

347
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,827
the same number of times, so.

348
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, I'll take a look
for some maps.

349
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,300
Thank you, Mary.

350
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,767
Hope you got something
hot and strong for me, Mary?

351
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:14,867
Sure do!

352
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,233
You're the best.

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh.

354
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,033
Hey!

355
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,367
Hello.

356
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,166
You're back already?

357
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,633
I...

358
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:28,266
I didn't quite make it out.

359
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,567
I see.

360
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:31,974
Are you in a bit over your head,

361
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,066
so to speak?

362
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm fine.

363
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,233
Here you go, Ben.

364
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,667
Thank you.

365
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,834
Why don't you have a seat...

366
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,400
right here?

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,867
Wow.

368
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,467
This lovely lady

369
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,333
could use a Cable Cove
crash course,

370
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,834
and you are the guy for the job.

371
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:54,967
Happy to help.

372
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,367
Okay, um,

373
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
here's a bit of history.

374
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,200
120 years ago,

375
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,834
they set up
a telegraph cable line

376
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:02,800
right here,

377
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,009
giving Cable Cove its name.

378
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:04,900
Now,

379
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,033
the Pacific Ocean,

380
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,343
which introduced itself
to you today...

381
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,867
Rather rudely...

382
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,333
- Is all around us

383
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:11,643
and it has a tendency
to be a little moody.

384
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,767
One minute,
it's blue skies and calm tides,

385
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,500
the next, it's white squalls
and raging winds.

386
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,100
Now the fun part.

387
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,934
Cable Cove
is known for its whales,

388
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:22,934
specifically the Orcas.

389
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,200
Southern Resident Orcas,
to be precise.

390
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,767
Wow. What else you got?

391
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,367
Well, even though
they are called Resident Orcas,

392
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,700
they like to travel,

393
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,200
sometimes as far north
as Alaska,

394
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,476
or all the way
down to California,

395
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,700
but this time of year,
they always come back here...

396
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:37,867
Because it's dinner-time.

397
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
The Chinook salmon run
brings them to the Salish Sound.

398
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,333
That's right.

399
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,000
To this river here.

400
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,834
The Chinooks then return
to the Coldstream River

401
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:46,834
to spawn,

402
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,343
and the whales
just sit back and relax

403
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,633
and wait to feast.

404
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,400
In fact,
it's the circle of life.

405
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:52,934
I'm impressed.

406
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:53,934
You did your homework.

407
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,633
Well, it was a long flight.

408
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:58,767
How's classes going?

409
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,066
Oh!

410
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,333
- Goodness! Sorry.
- You okay?

411
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,767
Class is...

412
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,600
it's going great.

413
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,409
I'm not sure who the student
and who the teacher is.

414
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,166
Well, that's the best kind.

415
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,433
A symbiotic relationship.

416
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,633
Thank you.

417
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,847
Are these all for Saturday?

418
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,066
They sure are.

419
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,776
I just need to get them steamed
and cleaned by then.

420
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,834
What's Saturday?

421
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:23,734
Oh, it's my annual
Fine-dining Dock Dinner Party!

422
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:26,142
Kind of a big deal around here.

423
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,567
I get the lobsters
flown in from the Atlantic,

424
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,533
triple-A fillets
from the Prairies,

425
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,333
and champagne.

426
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,333
The good stuff.

427
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,467
Nice.

428
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,400
Mary sells tickets

429
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,400
and all the proceeds

430
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,053
go to the Cable Cove
Conservation Fund.

431
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,967
What's that?

432
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,000
It's an organization
that helps make sure

433
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,767
all the Resident Orcas
keep coming back.

434
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,266
You know, it's our busiest time
for tourists.

435
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,166
Between the Orca migration
and the dock party,

436
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,600
everything is booked up.

437
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,100
I'm sure you must be super busy

438
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,443
with the whale-watching
tours then.

439
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,600
Yeah, yeah.

440
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:57,100
The first few days
are a little light, but...

441
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:59,667
Ben, why don't you
take Chloe out on the boat

442
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,834
and show her around
while you still have a chance?

443
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,353
I don't think
Chloe needs my help.

444
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,333
It might actually be nice
to have a little local guidance,

445
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:10,667
if you have time.

446
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,867
Yeah, well,

447
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,433
showing people around Cable Cove
is kind of my thing.

448
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,567
I'd love to help.

449
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:26,600
Thank you.

450
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:29,200
Hey, guys.

451
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,443
Oh, hey, Ben.
You headed out?

452
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:31,500
Sure am.

453
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,176
Taking Dr. Chloe Turner here
to study some whales.

454
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,333
Just Chloe, not a doctor.

455
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:35,333
Not yet.

456
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,147
Well, you've got
the best guy to guide you.

457
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm Adrian and this is Shawna.

458
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,533
- Hi.
- Hi.

459
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
I love your boat!

460
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,834
Thanks.

461
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,109
What a beautiful place to live.

462
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,367
Yeah, it is.

463
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,943
You just have to make sure
you stay moisturized.

464
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,000
No one wants to look like
a salty old fisherman.

465
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,400
Speak for yourself!

466
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,734
- Good haul today?
- Oh, yes.

467
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,133
These ones are real beauties.

468
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,400
Oh!

469
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,586
Well, it's lovely
to meet you all.

470
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,567
Likewise.

471
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
We'll see you around the Cove.

472
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,900
Welcome to my second home.

473
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,166
The Marine Magic.

474
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,333
Nice!

475
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,233
And definitely
more magical than mine.

476
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,467
On this boat, you only
get splashed if you want to.

477
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,233
Funny.

478
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,600
Let's see...

479
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,834
Oh, cool.

480
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:24,834
Is that an underwater camera?

481
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,300
Yeah, it is.

482
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,867
With 4K digital imaging.

483
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Nice.

484
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,934
As long as we're close enough,

485
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,867
whatever happens down there...

486
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,867
we can see on here.

487
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,033
Awesome.

488
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,900
I just got to figure out
where to install it.

489
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:40,533
Oh, don't put that...

490
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
All right.

491
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,333
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

492
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,200
Okay...

493
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,400
why don't you find
your sea legs,

494
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,000
and we'll install this later?

495
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,253
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

496
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,066
I'm sure
they're in here somewhere.

497
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,400
In the back somewhere.

498
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,166

499
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,834

Did you see something?

506
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,934
Not yet, but I got a theory.

507
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,233
You know, people always say
we're "whale watching",

508
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,433
but I think
the whales are watching us.

509
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,414
When they're ready to be seen,
they make sure to put on a show.

510
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,900
So you believe the whales know
we watch them for entertainment?

511
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,100
100%.

512
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,467
Yeah, the whales I know
have big personalities.

513
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,266
There must be food in the area!

514
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,776
The big one just breached
to let the others know!

515
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,233
Yeah.

516
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,767
And from what I can tell
by its tail fluke,

517
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,600
that's B-16,

518
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,233
or Romeo, as I like to call him.

519
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,033
- Romeo?
- Yeah.

520
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,000
This is Bravo pod,

521
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,467
and he's a big reason

522
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,567
why they're the biggest pod,
with 33 whales.

523
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,133
There are 33 whales
around us right now?

524
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,834
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

525
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,600
Tidewater to Marine Magic.

526
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,300
We have Delta pod up here
at Bowen Bay

527
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,767
and it's a bit of a party. Over.

528
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,333
Copy that.

529
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,700
All right, Doc,

530
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:38,843
let's see
if we can get you closer.

531
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:39,867
Where's the party?

532
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,367

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,300

538
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,800
Wow.

539
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:02,900
See what I mean
about putting on a show?

540
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,100
I have never been
this close to a whale before.

541
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,687
Ben, can I see the iPad?
I wanna look underwater.

542
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,533
Thank you.

543
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:30,974
This is like a dream come true.

544
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,700
The 101 on how to tie up a boat.

545
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,333
Pull tight.

546
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:50,907
Wrap it around the cleat,
back again,

547
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,967
turn, twist, and pull.

548
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Pull up.

549
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,834
I'm going to need
to see that again.

550
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,200
It's okay.
We've got all week.

551
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,400
Okay, so...

552
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,934
there are three major
transient Orca pods...

553
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,934
The B-, D- and E-pods.

554
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:07,233
Yup. Bravo, Delta and Echo.

555
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,400
Bravo is the biggest,

556
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:11,133
but Delta has Granny.

557
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,533
- Granny?
- Yeah.

558
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,600
She's the oldest Orca
we have around here.

559
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
105 years old,

560
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:19,309
but don't tell her
I told you her age.

561
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,333
Okay, okay.

562
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,834
And their societal structure
is matriarchal, right?

563
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,743
Meaning that sons and daughters
will stay with their mothers

564
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,543
even after they've had
offspring of their own.

565
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:29,567
Yeah.

566
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,140
They have really strong
family bonds.

567
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:32,834
That's crazy.

568
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:33,967
That must mean

569
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,209
Granny pretty much
runs everything around here.

570
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:36,100
She sure does.

571
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:37,100
I wouldn't want
to mess with her.

572
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,800
She's kind of like
"The Codmother".

573
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:44,900
So what about the Echo pod?

574
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,367
Well, Echo is
the smallest of the three,

575
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,166
which kind of makes it
my favorite.

576
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,166
There's nine of them,

577
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,066
and they're a really
tight-knit unit.

578
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,867
We saw Bravo and Delta today.

579
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,120
Where do you think Echo was?

580
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,567
That's a good question.

581
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,867
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen them for a while.

582
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,066
Is that normal?

583
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,867
For an entire pod to be M.I.A.
this time of year?

584
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Not really.

585
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,633
But I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

586
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,200
Just a fluke.

587
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:14,767
- Was that a joke?
- A bad one.

588
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,400
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

589
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,500
But they'll show up.

590
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
They have to.

591
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:41,500
Bravo.

592
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,867
We saw you first.

593
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,433
Delta.

594
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,767
I'll find you, Echo.

595
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,033
Good morning, Professor.

596
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,700
Chloe, good morning!

597
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:15,867
How was it?

598
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,433
It was incredible.

599
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,343
I got up close with
two of the three Orca pods

600
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,609
that migrate
through these waters.

601
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,242
I've been watching
your underwater footage

602
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:23,266
on the link you sent me!

603
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,309
I could just sit at the computer

604
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,000
and watch it all day!

605
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,176
Aren't they just magnificent?

606
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,066
I'm happy to hear

607
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,409
you're starting to see
the whales

608
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:30,533
in their natural habitat.

609
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,233
Now, where is the third pod?

610
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:33,667
I'm not sure.

611
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,233
But I was thinking of conducting
some onshore tests today

612
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,233
to see if there might be

613
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,509
a reason
the Echo pod is missing.

614
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,133
That's a good idea.

615
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:42,000
Do everything you can
to locate them.

616
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,066
Without all three
of the local pods to research,

617
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,333
any study you carry out
would be inconclusive.

618
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:48,867
That's what I'm afraid of.

619
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,080
You know better than anyone

620
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,667
that where there are questions,
there are answers.

621
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,834
Go out and find them.

622
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:55,834
Thank you.

623
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,633
Oh! Thank you!

624
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,576
Still looking for the whales?

625
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,900
Yeah.

626
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:23,800
You know, those Orcas
have always been unpredictable.

627
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:25,533
You know, off the Florida Coast,

628
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,600
we saw a major drop-off
of the Right whales,

629
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:28,894
and then when I investigated,

630
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,676
we saw that their food source
had been compromised.

631
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,233
Well, you think the Echo pod

632
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:34,300
might be migrating
somewhere else for feed?

633
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:36,867
Well, I think
it's a good place to start.

634
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,640
I know I'd migrate here
for your cupcakes.

635
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:41,400
So good!
Thank you.

636
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:46,467
Hi, Shawna!

637
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,467
Oh, hey, Chloe.

638
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,433
Looking to do
some crabbing today?

639
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,867
No, no. Thank you.

640
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I was actually wondering,

641
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,276
have you seen
the Echo pod recently?

642
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
You know what?

643
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,600
I don't think I have.

644
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:58,400
- Hey, Adrian?
- Yes, Captain?

645
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,266
Have you seen Echo pod recently?

646
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
That's the little one, right?

647
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:03,934
Not since last year.

648
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,066
I wonder why.

649
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,633
How's the salmon run
this season?

650
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,500
I'd say it's the healthiest
it's ever been.

651
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,600
Yeah. Every whale in the region
should be here.

652
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,134
If we see them,
we can let you know.

653
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, please do.

654
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,409
I'm starting
to get a little worried.

655
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,300
- Good luck, Chloe.
- Thank you.

656
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:22,667

for the sun to go down ♪

657
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:29,300

662
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,100
Oh.

663
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,533
What's up, Doc?

664
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:05,734
- Hey.
- How's it goin'?

665
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:06,734
It would be better

666
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,076
if I could figure out
where Echo pod is.

667
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,700
Oh, I put a call out

668
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:11,554
to some of the other
whale-watching boats...

669
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Nothing yet.

670
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:16,367
It's weird.

671
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,900
I checked the water temperature,
it seems normal.

672
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,710
There's no parasites
in the local shellfish,

673
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:22,009
and there's plenty
of salmon running.

674
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,433
I've been doing this
a long time,

675
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,600
and every season,

676
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:26,300
the whales get me
chasing my tail.

677
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:28,567
I don't have all season.

678
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,767
I have a research study

679
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
that needs evidence

680
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,567
backed up
by all three of the pods.

681
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,867
What about a water sample?

682
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,100
That's a good idea.

683
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:36,273
I could take an extraction

684
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,327
of the volumes and mutations
of the phytoplankton.

685
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,867
Algae, Ben.

686
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,700
The base layer
of the marine food chain.

687
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:44,700
Right.

688
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,034
Healthy supplies of it mean...

689
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,734
- happy whales.
- Happy whales!

690
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,166
I was... right there.

691
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,340
Well, I know a great spot
to get a sample.

692
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,600
Are you gonna eat that?

693
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,367
Yeah. Of course I am.
Let's go!

694
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,066
- Okay.
- Hurry!

695
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,867
Come on in.

696
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:06,100
You're lucky you came

697
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,393
during the one week of the year
when the water is warm.

698
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:12,467
Ish. Yeah.
I forgot to say "ish".

699
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,309
I thought this was
supposed to be the Pacific,

700
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,533
not the Antarctic!

701
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:18,600
The water's not going
to sample itself.

702
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:20,867
Breathe.

703
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,040
Become one with the water.

704
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,000
That's it.

705
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:26,266
I'm about to become one
with hypothermia.

706
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,266
Yeah, I like to do
a few cold plunges a week,

707
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,100
follow it up
with a beach bonfire.

708
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:35,233
Very interesting story.

709
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,910
You know what people
usually like to avoid?

710
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:37,800
Torture.

711
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,166
Ah. Right.

712
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,420
Hey, it does look like
there's a bit of algae in here.

713
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,500
Okay, gotta go.
I can't feel my feet.

714
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:45,467
Oh, slippery!

715
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,767
Yeah, definitely...
Definitely algae!

716
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,433
What?

717
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:56,934
Some weather rolling in.

718
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,109
Does that mean we can't go out
on the water tomorrow?

719
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,133
Depends.

720
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,166
Rain we can handle,

721
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,333
but if it's bad winds,

722
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:04,600
we'll have to stay on shore.

723
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Hey...

724
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:08,910
do you wanna grab a bite
at Mary's?

725
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,567
Her sign says
"Bed and Breakfast",

726
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,420
but she really
serves something hot all day.

727
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:14,734
Maybe another time.

728
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,300
I... gotta go defrost.

729
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:18,633
Of course.
Warm up those feet.

730
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:20,300
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, well,

731
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:22,033
see you around.

732
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,333
- Bye.
- Bye.

733
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:29,300
Marcus?

734
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:30,433
Hey, Chloe!

735
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,600
What are you doing at school?

736
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:35,100
I'm just moving into
my side of the office.

737
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,233
I did take up
a little bit more than half,

738
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:38,367
if I'm being honest,

739
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,307
but you keep your microscope
in the lab, right?

740
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,333
Marcus...

741
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,176
I know, I'm supposed to give
you your space this week, I do,

742
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,266
but, you know,

743
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,776
I just wanted
to check in on the Orcas.

744
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,500
We saw them jumping,
splashing, playing.

745
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,000
It was amazing.

746
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,633
Nice. I thought they only did
that stuff at the aquarium.

747
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,600
No, no.

748
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,266
They do it in the ocean, too.

749
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,367
Look, Chloe.

750
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,700
I know that sometimes
we're on different wavelengths,

751
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,700
but I really believe

752
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,633
that this shared office

753
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,834
is going to bring us
closer together.

754
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,367
I know you do.

755
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,834
And don't worry,

756
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,734
I'll keep your side
of the office warm.

757
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,433
See ya.

758
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,166
Where are you, Echo?

759
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
Mary! Hi!

760
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,934
Heavens to Betsy!

761
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,306
I didn't want you to get soaked

762
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,600
first thing
on your way to breakfast.

763
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:18,867
That is so nice, thank you.

764
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,266
Oh, it's just a little
tea and toast.

765
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:24,767
Boy, that rain is something.

766
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,367
It seems you might be
land-locked today.

767
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,409
Yeah, I think my study
is going to be put on pause.

768
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:30,934
You've just got to get creative.

769
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,100
Creative?

770
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:33,433
How can I be creative in this?

771
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,233
Well, being this close
to the ocean

772
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,133
might give you some great ideas.

773
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,133
See you later.

774
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,433
I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

775
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,934
No, no.

776
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,000
I was just enjoying
the pitter patter.

777
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:09,500
Thanks.

778
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,713
Well, they don't call it
"the wet coast" for nothing.

779
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,500
It's a bit of a howler
out there,

780
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,393
but in my experience,
no storm lasts forever.

781
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:20,834
Everything okay?

782
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,667
The water samples
came back clean.

783
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,200
I need some inspiration

784
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,213
to figure out why
the Echo pod is still missing.

785
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,066
You know what,

786
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,433
I know a place
that just might help.

787
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,433
Come on.
Let's go check it out.

788
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,867
Wow!

789
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,266
Yeah.

790
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,440
We call this guy "Biggie".

791
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,166
I can understand why.

792
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:50,467
We're lucky to have

793
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,843
such an extensive variety
of whales to study

794
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:53,533
right here in Cable Cove,

795
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,600
even after they've lived out
their best lives.

796
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,700
Whoa, whoa.

797
00:33:57,834 --> 00:33:58,867
Hey.

798
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,242
Have the Orcas really been
in the Salish Sea

799
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,734
for 5,000 years?

800
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:04,400
Yeah. That's our best estimate.

801
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:07,276
Come here,
I want to show you another room.

802
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,433
It's...

803
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,233
it's kind of my favorite place.

804
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:13,400
I call this "the playground".

805
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,133
Cool.

806
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,400
It's mostly family heirlooms

807
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,867
that have been passed down
over generations.

808
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,066
This is actually
a part of a whale bone

809
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,066
that's been converted to an ax.

810
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,000
No way.

811
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,567
- I can touch?
- Absolutely.

812
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,934
Wow.

813
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:33,133
- It's cool, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

814
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:36,467
And this was actually

815
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,800
a mold of my teeth
when I was younger.

816
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:41,800
I'll use it to talk
when I'm old and toothless.

817
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:42,934
I know.

818
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:46,900
I know what this is.

819
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,033
Of course you do.

820
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:50,300
This here is an Orca fin.

821
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:51,300
That's right.

822
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,000
I actually found this guy.

823
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,734
He was washed up
on one of our local beaches.

824
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:56,867
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

825
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,533
I think it's exceptional
what you have here.

826
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,700
I just hope it inspires
the next generation.

827
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,400
The next whale watchers,

828
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,667
the next doctors.

829
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,580
Hey, do you think I can get

830
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,242
some of the footage
from your underwater camera?

831
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:14,333
Of course.

832
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,700
I've never seen our pods
from that perspective before.

833
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,276
I'd love to show
the people we work with.

834
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,740
Sure, I'll send you
the link tonight.

835
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,109
Hopefully, there'll be
more footage to add

836
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,266
if we get back on the water.

837
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,409
The weather's clearing up a bit.

838
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,176
Might be a little late
to get out on the boat,

839
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,166
but there is a place
I could take you

840
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,633
where we could see the whales
out of the water.

841
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:31,767
It's a bit of a hike,

842
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,000
but the views are killer.

843
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,500
If you're up for it.

844
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,793
- Yeah, I wanna go.
- Come on.

845
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:40,467
- You good?
- Yes.

846
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,867
All right, we've got to hurry.

847
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Hurry for what?

848
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,000
The sun is going down.

849
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:46,333
Oh, right. Okay.

850
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:47,834
All right, step up.

851
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,934
- Thank you.
- Almost there.

852
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,633
Careful.

853
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,333
Okay.

854
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,306
I thought it would be cool

855
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,343
for you to see
the whale migration

856
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,467
from a different viewpoint.

857
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Oh, my goodness.

858
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:11,633
- See over there?
- Yeah.

859
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,266
Those are The Broken Islands.

860
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,320
That's pretty much the start
of The Salish Sound.

861
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,633
So it's like a gateway, right?

862
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:19,767
Exactly.

863
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,066
If the Echo pod
isn't already in the Sound,

864
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,376
then they should be
arriving shortly

865
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,567
right through those islands.

866
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,800
That's my best guess.

867
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,600
They'll come.

868
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,867
You just... have to be patient.

869
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,967
Yeah, I just wish I had time
to wait around and see them.

870
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,133
Can't you extend your study
by a few days?

871
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:39,700
Or a week?

872
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,967
I don't think so.

873
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,800
I'd miss an important
scholarship deadline,

874
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,800
and...

875
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:48,567
I'm supposed to be moving in
with my boyfriend.

876
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,967
Oh.

877
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,380
Well, those are
some good reasons

878
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,266
to get back to Florida.

879
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,100
Well, not like in-in...

880
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:59,767
It's...

881
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,934
it's complicated.

882
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:02,133
Yeah.

883
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,700
What's the research
application thing?

884
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:07,033
Well, my professor wants me
to apply for a scholarship.

885
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,767
That would mean
I could spend more time here.

886
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,867
Not here specifically, but...

887
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,734
maybe.

888
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:18,867
I'd like that.

889
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:22,700
Oh...

890
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:23,934
look.

891
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,800
Just off the point.

892
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,300
You see it?

893
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:31,900
Wow.

894
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:34,400
It's a humpback!

895
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Look closely.

896
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:40,900
It's breaching!

897
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,206
Look, there's another one!

898
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,266
Oh! Wow.

899
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:53,600
Wow.

900
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,433
Pretty cool, huh?

901
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,600
Thank you for bringing me here.

902
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,033
Of course.

903
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,633
Oh! It's so cold today!

904
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:21,343
Yeah, the weather can change
quite a bit out here

905
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,900
this time of year.

906
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,166
One minute, it's rainy,
the next minute, it's sunny,

907
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,800
but the good news is

908
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,400
tomorrow's supposed to be clear,

909
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,233
so we can spend the whole day
on the water together.

910
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,400
Uh, together with the whales,
that is.

911
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:35,900
Right.

912
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:36,867
You want some coffee?

913
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,100
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you.

914
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,100
Great.

915
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,100
You know, that will actually
be great for me.

916
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:41,100
I want to take out
my hydrophone.

917
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:43,300
If we can get close enough
to a pod,

918
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:44,609
we can listen
to their communication.

919
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:45,633
Ah, I see.

920
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,042
And what do you think
they'll be saying?

921
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:49,333
Well, it really depends
on the sound.

922
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:51,776
They're super smart and social,
so they tend to talk a lot.

923
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,767
Well, they'd get along great
with my Aunt Doreen.

924
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,166
I wonder where Mary is.

925
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:00,300
Mary?

926
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:03,000
Mary?

927
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,333
Oh, hey.

928
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,367
Mary, what's wrong?

929
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,900
The storm last night was brutal.

930
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,200
So many trees are down,

931
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,600
and the only road
into Cable Cove is underwater.

932
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,840
Our guests for the weekend

933
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,254
are stranded
in the next town over

934
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:18,667
with no way in!

935
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:21,867
Oh, Mary.

936
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,467
It's okay.
We'll figure it out.

937
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,734
Oh, thank you.

938
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,033
It looks like

939
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,009
all the reservations are
for tourists from out of town,

940
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,333
and they're all set
to get here tomorrow.

941
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:31,734
That means no whale watching,

942
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:33,166
no fishing boat,

943
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
no dock party.

944
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,900
I mean, this is
our biggest weekend of the year,

945
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:39,233
and Cable Cove
is going to be empty.

946
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:40,567
How far away is the next town?

947
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,867
It's Port Douglas.

948
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,633
About an hour by car,

949
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:44,633
but the only problem is

950
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:45,776
it's one road in
and one road out.

951
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,734
And that road is closed.

952
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:49,734
How far is it by boat?

953
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,734
All right,

954
00:39:58,867 --> 00:40:00,066
it's looking like

955
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,676
about four hours to Port Douglas
and back by boat.

956
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,810
That is if you time it right
going through Deception Pass.

957
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,700
That's right.

958
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,433
What's Deception Pass?

959
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:09,567
It's a narrow pass
in a shallow body of water.

960
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,009
The boats don't usually
go through there

961
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,667
unless they have to.

962
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,066
The depth can be deceiving.

963
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,233
Hence the name.

964
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,533
You have to time yourself
perfectly with the tides,

965
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,533
otherwise you'll bottom out.

966
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,867
Right now, this is
our only chance

967
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,480
of getting our guests
into Cable Cove.

968
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,133
I think it's worth the risk.

969
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:25,506
I mean, I can go through first,

970
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,773
radio back to the other boats
when it's safe for passage.

971
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:29,867
I'll get it done.

972
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:31,000
We'll get it done.

973
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:33,100
You are my hero, Ben!

974
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,367
Well, this is Deception Pass,

975
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,667
but I'm not loving

976
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,142
the look of that channel marker
up there.

977
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,767
Looking a little too deceptive?

978
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,200
Yes, exactly.

979
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,734
Yeah, timing might be off
by a couple of hours.

980
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:53,074
What do you say we drop anchor?

981
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,333
Ay-aye, Cap'n.

982
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,500
Right.

983
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:56,900
- It's back here.
- Oh!

984
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,367
- Right.
- Yeah.

985
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,900
Just tell the boats to hold off
until it's passable.

986
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:03,100
Okay. If you really want
to understand a whale,

987
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:04,433
you've got to listen.

988
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:05,834
I'm sorry.
What was that?

989
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,567
Funny.

990
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,300
- This here is a hydrophone.
- Mm-hmm.

991
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,467
It picks up signals
from all over the ocean,

992
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,520
way further out than
a camera could ever capture.

993
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:15,400
We drop it in,

994
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:18,400
and the low-frequency calls
are collected onto an app,

995
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,200
but we can also listen
right here.

996
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,633
So, my Aunt Doreen,

997
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:24,867
she works with the museum,

998
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,440
she said
that you could use the space

999
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,133
as a research facility.

1000
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:31,567
Yeah. Then we thought maybe
the history might inspire you.

1001
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,220
That would be great.
Thank you so much.

1002
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,266
Wait.

1003
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:38,900
Do you hear that clicking sound?

1004
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,066
Yeah.

1005
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,120
That's the Orcas using
echolocation to find food.

1006
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:43,934
They make noises

1007
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:45,376
through this space
in their forehead

1008
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,633
called a "melon".

1009
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:47,767
It's pretty cool, right?

1010
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Yeah.

1011
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,467
Do you hear that?

1012
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,033
That high-pitched sound?

1013
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,433
That's them
talking to each other.

1014
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:55,834
They're close.

1015
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Look, they're here!

1016
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,200
Four, five,

1017
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,166
six...

1018
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,600
seven.

1019
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:06,810
It's definitely a smaller pod.

1020
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:07,700
Eight, nine... yeah.

1021
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:08,834
I think this might be...

1022
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:09,967
Is it the Echo pod?

1023
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,533
That's them.

1024
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,000
Thank you.

1025
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:21,667
Yeah, a lot of whale action
on the water recently.

1026
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,200
There you go.
Glad we could help.

1027
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,453
If you're staying at Mary's,

1028
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:25,876
it's just a left
at the end of the rail.

1029
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,333
There you are.

1030
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:28,467
All right. Bye.

1031
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,133
Well,

1032
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:32,033
one successful
tourist-recovery mission.

1033
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,500
And one successful
Echo pod location.

1034
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:36,333
Hey-hey!

1035
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,934
Oh, nice job.

1036
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:39,200
Yeah, I had a good teacher.

1037
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,367
Oh.

1038
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,233
Maybe I could take him
to dinner sometime?

1039
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:44,266
I know just the place.

1040
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:46,867
It's close by,

1041
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,133
has a great view,

1042
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,266
wonderful owner.

1043
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,500
Are you talking about Mary's?

1044
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:51,700
Mm-hmm.

1045
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:52,834
Ding-ding-ding.

1046
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,266
Look, I got him breaching!

1047
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,867
I wish I could jump that high.

1048
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:02,100
Wow, I can't believe
I captured that.

1049
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:04,066
Hey, do you see that
right there?

1050
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Yeah, yeah.

1051
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,443
That's Betty.
She's one of the adult females.

1052
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:07,547
It's know it's hard to tell

1053
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:08,843
with the way
the water distorts the images,

1054
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,000
but...

1055
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:11,710
doesn't something seem
different about her?

1056
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:12,734
Maybe.

1057
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,734
I'd have to see it
blown up bigger.

1058
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:17,867
Yeah. I'll upload it tonight
and get a closer look.

1059
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:20,533
But, really, I'd like to see

1060
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,100
all of your photos
blown up bigger.

1061
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,934
You're such
a talented photographer,

1062
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:27,567
and your underwater footage
is incredible.

1063
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,700
You got my link?

1064
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:29,867
Yeah.

1065
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,333
And I shared it with my sister,

1066
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,367
who teaches kindergarten.

1067
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,367
The kids went nuts.

1068
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,567
I love imagining

1069
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,700
that other people are watching
the whales with us.

1070
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:39,967
There's something
about the way you see whales.

1071
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:42,767
I just...

1072
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,867
I wish more people
could see them the way you do,

1073
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Do you think

1074
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,843
that would make them
want to protect them, too?

1075
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,133
Absolutely.

1076
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,734
Oh! Hey, guys.

1077
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:55,734
Look who it is.

1078
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:56,734
Hey.

1079
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,467
I have never seen
Mary's like this

1080
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,333
and I need to sit down
after our day!

1081
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:04,967
We haven't had crab traps
that full in a long time.

1082
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,467
That's not a bad problem
to have.

1083
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,433
You're not wrong.

1084
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:09,233
I can take your orders.

1085
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:10,567
I can take them... oh!

1086
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,867
Right now.

1087
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:15,100
I am in the weeds,
but I'm having fun!

1088
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,000
Well, I'll take

1089
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:18,000
the fish 'n' chips,
please, Mary.

1090
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,000
- Okay. Two?
- Fish 'n' chips?

1091
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:21,967
Looks like fish 'n' chips
all around.

1092
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,600
Four fish 'n' chips
coming right up.

1093
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,834
Might be the last of my cod.

1094
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:30,167
Food orders have been delayed
with this washed-out road.

1095
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,967
But I'm not complaining.

1096
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,333
Look at this place...

1097
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:35,333
Full of visitors...

1098
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:36,333
Thanks to the two of you.

1099
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,467
Come on, it was nothing.

1100
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Besides...

1101
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:40,633
we had a lot of fun...

1102
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:44,200
And we found the Echo pod
we've been looking for.

1103
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,266
Good! Good!

1104
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,609
I can't wait to hear
all about it...

1105
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:49,600
After I drop the fryers!

1106
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:50,934
Thanks, Mary.

1107
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,433
Did Echo pod
come into the Sound?

1108
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:54,233
No, they were in the Straight,

1109
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:56,247
which Ben said is unusual
for this time of year.

1110
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,093
Yeah, it's definitely not
their normal route.

1111
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,840
But you know those Orcas...

1112
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:01,847
They have the whole ocean
to play hide-and-seek.

1113
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,667
Oh, Mary looks like
she could use a hand.

1114
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,567
Hey, I got it.

1115
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,867
I got it.

1116
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,080
- Just in time.
- Thank you.

1117
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:12,033
So...

1118
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,400
are you staying in town long?

1119
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:15,367
No. Unfortunately,

1120
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,576
I have to leave
at the end of the week.

1121
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Oh, that's too bad.

1122
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,734
It's been nice to see Ben

1123
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:20,710
with someone who enjoys
being with the whales so much.

1124
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:21,934
You both have a lot in common.

1125
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:24,033
Don't tell him this,

1126
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,343
but I would have been lost
without him.

1127
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:29,233
Oh, well, he has been
a little lost out here himself.

1128
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:30,643
I haven't seen him having
such a good time

1129
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:31,934
in a long time.

1130
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,533
It's been really fun.

1131
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:36,467
It is so nice
to have another girl around.

1132
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,033
It's been a lot of guy stuff
since Ben's ex left town.

1133
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,367
Some drinks for you ladies.

1134
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,633
Oh, thank you.

1135
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:47,166
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1136
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:19,767
I don't understand why.

1137
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,934
Ben.

1138
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:34,066
Hey.

1139
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:36,367
What are you doing up so late?

1140
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,567
I could ask you the same thing.

1141
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
I'm looking for answers.

1142
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,133
Huh. Me too.

1143
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,333
You know,
sometimes you find them

1144
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:45,987
when the light hits
a little different.

1145
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:48,567
I'm sorry, what?

1146
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,266
Come on.

1147
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,700
You've gotta see for yourself.

1148
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,166
I have never seen so many stars.

1149
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,000
You know what they say,

1150
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,633
there's more stars in the sky
than grains of sand on earth.

1151
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:08,767
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1152
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,934
That's hard to believe.

1153
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:11,826
Well, some things
you need to see to believe.

1154
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:14,700
Like tonight.

1155
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:15,700
I knew I couldn't tell you...

1156
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:18,000
You needed to see it
for yourself.

1157
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,609
- Hot chocolate?
- Oh, yes, please.

1158
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:21,633
Mm-hmm.

1159
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:26,300
So what exactly
am I looking for?

1160
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:28,500
You'll know when you see it.

1161
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:32,867
Can I get a hint?

1162
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,300
Sure.

1163
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:42,033
I spy with my little eye

1164
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,633
something that is green.

1165
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,233
I don't see anything green.

1166
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,800
No?

1167
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,367
Look up.

1168
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:02,934
How is...

1169
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,767
Aurora Borealis.

1170
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,900
Wow.

1171
00:48:05,934 --> 00:48:07,333
It's just magic.

1172
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,433
I cannot believe
you get to live here.

1173
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:10,433
Yeah, well,

1174
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:11,810
I wouldn't want
to live anywhere else.

1175
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:13,433
Have you ever been
anywhere else?

1176
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,333
- Yes. Thank you.
- All right.

1177
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:18,609
I tried the city out
for a few months last year,

1178
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:23,066
but sometimes, it's more than
just the geography

1179
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,133
that's incompatible.

1180
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:26,266
And sometimes,

1181
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,834
you come to a place
that seems far away...

1182
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:31,333
and it feels like home.

1183
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,266
What about you?

1184
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,900
Are you finding the answers
you were looking for out there?

1185
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:41,567
Yeah. Yeah.

1186
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,734
Some of them.

1187
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:45,567
You?

1188
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,100
I think all my questions
are still on my desk.

1189
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,500
You know, I was actually

1190
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,242
thinking of listening
to the sonar recordings

1191
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:52,500
until I am fluent in Orca.

1192
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,133
But I don't know.

1193
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,833
I feel like it's going
to take a miracle.

1194
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:00,233
A night like tonight

1195
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:02,900
kind of makes
miracles seem possible.

1196
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:04,633
Doesn't it?

1197
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,333
Okay.

1198
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,900
Yes, open the email
and the attachment.

1199
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,066
Now compare that

1200
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,443
to the aerial image
of the Echo pod

1201
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:58,467
from last year.

1202
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,667
Do you see it?

1203
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,967
There does seem to be

1204
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,233
a much more significant bulge
in her abdominal region.

1205
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,567
Right? Right?

1206
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,533
Because...

1207
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:07,533
she's pregnant!

1208
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:09,734
I would be inclined
to agree with you.

1209
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:13,400
Given the Southern Resident
Orca whale's small population,

1210
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:15,633
this is
a phenomenal discovery, Chloe.

1211
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:17,500
How will we know when she's due?

1212
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:20,300
Orca whales gestate
for 15-18 months.

1213
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:21,266
She's showing,

1214
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,880
but she could still have
a ways to go.

1215
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
You know, I was wondering

1216
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:25,633
if her pregnancy

1217
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,834
has anything to do

1218
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:29,767
with the Echo pod changing
their migration patterns.

1219
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,033
Is this what you're exploring
for your Ph.D. thesis?

1220
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:33,734
Yeah! Plus,
I was actually thinking

1221
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:35,834
I could build a website

1222
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:36,967
and live-stream

1223
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,409
the underwater footage
I've been getting.

1224
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:40,533
The more people feel like
they know the whales,

1225
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:41,810
the more they'll want
to protect them.

1226
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:43,867
That sounds like a great idea

1227
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,409
and an excellent addition
to your research.

1228
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:48,133
It's just that it would take
a lot more time and funding

1229
00:50:48,266 --> 00:50:50,106
to stay here long enough
to be able to do that.

1230
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:53,000
That's what
scholarships are for.

1231
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,200
Chloe, you have

1232
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,109
an incredible opportunity
over there at Cable Cove

1233
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,400
to really make a difference.

1234
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:58,693
Now, the application deadline

1235
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,300
for the National
Doctoral Scholarship

1236
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,734
closes at midnight on Sunday.

1237
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:04,133
That's the same night
you're flying out.

1238
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:06,066
Do you think
you can get it done by then?

1239
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,033
I've heard this is a place
where miracles are possible.

1240
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,300
Oh.

1241
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,300
I'm looking for Ben Winters.
Is he around?

1242
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:25,467
No. No.

1243
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,743
I think he's gone
whale watching.

1244
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:29,900
Of course,
always with his whales.

1245
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:31,467
Some things never change.

1246
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,100
If you see Ben,

1247
00:51:34,233 --> 00:51:36,033
do you mind telling him
I'm here waiting?

1248
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:40,800
Who...

1249
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:42,200
should I say is waiting?

1250
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,667
Shannon.

1251
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,800
I guess you could call me
an old friend.

1252
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,233
Hey, doc.

1253
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:50,487
I thought I'd find you here.

1254
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:52,467
Hi.

1255
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:53,433
Wow.

1256
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:55,400
- Nice command center!
- Thanks.

1257
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:56,400
And guess what...

1258
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:58,000
- Betty...
- Uh-huh?

1259
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,233
Is pregnant!

1260
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:00,734
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

1261
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:03,133
No way!
This is great news!

1262
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,700
Not only is she expecting...

1263
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:05,633
If you look at the images
from last year,

1264
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:06,843
she was pregnant then, too,

1265
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:07,734
which means...

1266
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:09,800
she's due any day now.

1267
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:11,076
We have to let everyone know.

1268
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,100
This is...

1269
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:13,233
This is great!

1270
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:14,376
The passing boats
need to slow down.

1271
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,576
I need to let
the whale watchers know

1272
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,876
that they need to stay
an extra 10...

1273
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,767
Ben?

1274
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,940
No, no, no, 20 feet away...

1275
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:19,900
Ben.

1276
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,133
Yeah?

1277
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,700
Take a breath.

1278
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,600
I am pretty sure the pod's
already protecting her.

1279
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:29,266
Yeah. Right.

1280
00:53:32,066 --> 00:53:34,500
I also made
one other discovery today.

1281
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:35,767
Shannon.

1282
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,033
Oh! Shannon.

1283
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:42,066
Shannon's my ex-girlfriend.

1284
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,900
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1285
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:46,543
I hope she's not still
waiting at your office.

1286
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:48,100
Oh, no. No.

1287
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:49,609
She's just returning
my kayak paddles

1288
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,233
that I was storing with her.

1289
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:52,633
Yeah. Her and her boyfriend

1290
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,433
are turning their shed

1291
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,767
into a vlogging space
for their cats.

1292
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,734
- Huh.
- Yeah.

1293
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,633
But on the plus side,

1294
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:02,500
I got my paddles back.

1295
00:54:02,633 --> 00:54:04,233
I was thinking...

1296
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,367
there's this really cool,
super-awesome spot

1297
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,367
I could take you.

1298
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
I don't know.
That seems pretty...

1299
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:10,800
Romantic?

1300
00:54:10,934 --> 00:54:11,767
It's not.

1301
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,800
Totally professional.

1302
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:15,500
Scout's honor.

1303
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:16,867
Or whatever it is.

1304
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Okay.

1305
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:26,676
Mary, why are you
taking those down?

1306
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,000
The steak and lobster

1307
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:30,367
didn't make it past
the washed-out road in time.

1308
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,533
- Oh, no.
- There's no surf and turf.

1309
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:33,943
Well, isn't there
something we can do?

1310
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,333
Well, I'm afraid
the only thing to do now

1311
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:39,033
is figure out how to refund
all that ticket money.

1312
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,033
No, don't do that.

1313
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:41,600
We'll figure it out.

1314
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:45,100
Okay.

1315
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:53,476
You know, the dock party's

1316
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,800
our longest-standing tradition
in Cable Cove.

1317
00:54:55,934 --> 00:54:57,834
It's a chance for Mary
and the rest of the town

1318
00:54:57,967 --> 00:54:59,166
to show off a little.

1319
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,834
There's gotta be a solution.

1320
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,376
I just hope
I can figure it out in time.

1321
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,900
- We've hit water.
- What?

1322
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,242
- I said we've hit water!
- What?

1323
00:55:05,266 --> 00:55:06,400
I'm in the water!

1324
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,309
Okay, we're going to set it down
on the count of three.

1325
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:11,500
You ready?
One, two, three.

1326
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,867
That's it.

1327
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,400
- All right.
- All right. Come on.

1328
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,727
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold!

1329
00:55:22,066 --> 00:55:25,100
You can't play in the ocean
if you're afraid of getting wet.

1330
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:26,433
Okay.

1331
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:28,066
Deep breath, okay?

1332
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,467
Happy thoughts.

1333
00:55:31,734 --> 00:55:32,834

So, what do you think?

1350
00:56:15,934 --> 00:56:17,767
I mean, this is beautiful!

1351
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,033
Right?

1352
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:22,400
Yeah, this place is
a bit of a local secret.

1353
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,400
It really is perfect.

1354
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:34,333
I'm glad you like
our little corner of the world.

1355
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:36,067
You'd be surprised
what we can find here.

1356
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:38,700
You know what...

1357
00:56:38,834 --> 00:56:40,133
I've got an idea.

1358
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,333
Stay here,

1359
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:43,000
don't look,

1360
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,266
and no peeking, okay?

1361
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,567
Okay.

1362
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:10,867
Chloe!

1363
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,500
What you got there?

1364
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:18,967
Hope you're hungry.

1365
00:57:20,867 --> 00:57:22,266
- Oysters?
- Mm-hmm.

1366
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,500
I thought you said this wasn't
going to be romantic.

1367
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:26,900
It's not romance.

1368
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,333
It's sustenance.

1369
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:32,066
Thank you,
but I don't eat raw fish.

1370
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,000
Well, it's not eating,
it's experiencing.

1371
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:36,734
Besides, it's 100% protein.

1372
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:37,734
It's good for you.

1373
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:38,867
Okay.

1374
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,667
- Come on.
- Okay.

1375
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,667
- Mm.
- So?

1376
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,000
It's good, I like it.
Mm-hmm.

1377
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,734
Good. Another one?

1378
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,166
- Okay.
- I'm going to join you.

1379
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:57,633
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1380
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,333
To magic you have to see
to believe.

1381
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:03,367
To magic
you have to see to believe.

1382
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,166
- Mm!
- Mm!

1383
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,033
- So good.
- Mm-hmm.

1384
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:13,433
So, I was curious,

1385
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,667
do you have any theories
about the Echo pod yet?

1386
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,834
I have one,

1387
00:58:17,967 --> 00:58:20,400
and I'm basing my entire
scholarship application on it,

1388
00:58:20,533 --> 00:58:22,033
so I hope it's right.

1389
00:58:23,467 --> 00:58:24,767
Let's hear it.

1390
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,100
I believe

1391
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:28,233
that the Echo Orca pod

1392
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:29,767
is changing
their migratory patterns

1393
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,200
to suit the needs
of pregnant Betty.

1394
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:33,500
They're staying
out in the Straight,

1395
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:35,609
where there's less traffic,
less competition for food.

1396
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:36,734
Mm-hmm.

1397
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:38,166
They're nesting, if you will.

1398
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,300
Yeah?

1399
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,133
My hypothesis

1400
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:43,166
is that once
Betty's calf is born,

1401
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,209
they'll move to the Sound
with the rest of the whales.

1402
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:47,433
Sounds like
a pretty solid conclusion to me.

1403
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:48,667
Oh, no.

1404
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,543
I will not have a conclusion
until I have evidence,

1405
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:51,567
which I'm hoping

1406
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,433
comes in the form
of a happy, healthy baby whale.

1407
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:55,433
So what you're really saying is

1408
00:58:55,567 --> 00:58:56,567
that your study

1409
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,100
is just another thing
you have to see to believe.

1410
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:01,433
You get it.

1411
00:59:02,734 --> 00:59:05,266
So, um,
did you plant those oysters,

1412
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,843
or did you pick them up
off the beach?

1413
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:08,200
- Right off the beach.
- Wow.

1414
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,867
There's tons of food
to forage around here.

1415
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,233
You're right...

1416
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:13,900
There is plenty to forage here.

1417
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:15,200
And Adrian said he had

1418
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,000
more crab than he knew
what to do with.

1419
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:18,367
What are you saying?

1420
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,076
I'm saying Mary
doesn't need steak and lobster

1421
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,100
to have a dock party

1422
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,166
when she has a whole ocean
full of fine dining

1423
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,433
right at her front door!

1424
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:26,667
You're totally right.

1425
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:39,533
Wait.

1426
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,834
What is it?

1427
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,100
- Look! It's Betty!
- What?

1428
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,767
Betty-Betty?

1429
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,300
Oh, my gosh.

1430
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:52,767
Do you want your camera?

1431
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,633
No.

1432
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:58,033
This is too special.

1433
00:59:58,166 --> 00:59:59,400
This is just for us.

1434
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,567
It's her.

1435
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:05,834
It's her!

1436
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,467
Which means the Echo pod
is moving closer to the Sound.

1437
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,843
So the calf could be born
any day now.

1438
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:18,734
Yes!

1439
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:19,867
Mary! Great news!

1440
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:21,109
We don't have to cancel
the fundraiser.

1441
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:23,333
You're able to bring
lobsters back to life?

1442
01:00:23,467 --> 01:00:26,367
No. We were thinking
instead of flown-in food,

1443
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
how about we build a menu
of all local ingredients?

1444
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:31,166
I mean, Cable Cove has
all the fresh seafood we need.

1445
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,609
The tourists would get
a great kick

1446
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:34,533
out of having
the farm to table...

1447
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:36,200
The ocean to table experience.

1448
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,400
I don't know,

1449
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,734
I just stored away
all the linens and fancy china.

1450
01:00:39,867 --> 01:00:40,867
In the South,

1451
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:42,309
we do this thing called
a "seafood boil-up,"

1452
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,973
where we just roll
some paper down a table

1453
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:45,409
and then dump everything
in the middle.

1454
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,109
- That's a great idea.
- That sounds messy.

1455
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:49,133
Messy, yes.
Fun, also yes.

1456
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,467
Sounds like
we've got it all figured out.

1457
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,467
Absolutely.

1458
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,633
I'll get the posters,

1459
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:55,967
let everyone know.

1460
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,133
It's going to be amazing.
Party time! Whoo!

1461
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,300
Well, quite the dynamic duo
you two are.

1462
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:07,300
Chemistry is undeniable, Chloe.

1463
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:09,467
Everyone can feel it,

1464
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,700
even if you pretend not to.

1465
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,700
Ben and I have something.

1466
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:16,000
You're right.

1467
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:18,166
But in two days,

1468
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,443
I'm gonna be on a plane
to Miami,

1469
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,900
and he is gonna be here
in Cable Cove, where he belongs.

1470
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,633
Don't you feel like
you belong here, too?

1471
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:26,166
Maybe.

1472
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,400
Truthfully, this whole week
has made me wonder

1473
01:01:29,433 --> 01:01:30,900
what I'd be going back
to Miami for.

1474
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:34,176
You know,
whatever you want to call it

1475
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,133
between you and Ben...

1476
01:01:36,266 --> 01:01:37,333
It's there.

1477
01:01:37,467 --> 01:01:39,433
It's here.

1478
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:41,007
And whatever
you choose to do with it

1479
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:42,166
is up to you.

1480
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,934
Take it from me,

1481
01:01:45,066 --> 01:01:45,934
something like this

1482
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:48,000
only comes around
once in a lifetime.

1483
01:01:49,033 --> 01:01:50,333
If you're lucky.

1484
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:08,373
I need some Southern expertise.

1485
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:10,166
Ah!

1486
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,333
Wrapping paper
or brown packing paper?

1487
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:14,467
Brown paper.

1488
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,367
All right.

1489
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,633
And no plates, you're sure?

1490
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,776
Yeah. Everything just gets
throw out down the middle,

1491
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,700
which means we need
lots of napkins.

1492
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:22,633
Got it.

1493
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:24,266
Some of the photos
you took this week,

1494
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,166
do you mind if I use them
for my website?

1495
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,300
Oh, yeah.

1496
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,333
Of course.

1497
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,476
That is the least I could do.

1498
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,667
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1499
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,767
What are you working on?

1500
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,900
My thesis.

1501
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:36,166
I'm using it to pitch
a live-stream web-link

1502
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,166
for anyone that wants to watch
the whales underwater.

1503
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,166
When you said

1504
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,000
the kindergartners
like watching it,

1505
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,734
you've inspired me.

1506
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,333
I inspired you?

1507
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,233
What?

1508
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,533
You've been inspiring me
all week.

1509
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,443
I'd love to take you out
on your last day.

1510
01:02:57,467 --> 01:02:58,967
You don't have to do that.

1511
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,166
I want to.

1512
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,100
The Marine Magic's

1513
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,309
much better used
for whale studying

1514
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,834
than just whale watching.

1515
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,233
Thank you.

1516
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,500
Make no bones about it.

1517
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,533
- Get it?
- Mm-hmm.

1518
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,066
- Whale bones.
- Yes.

1519
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,700
It's funny.
You're laughing.

1520
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,834
See ya, Ben.

1521
01:03:30,734 --> 01:03:32,767
Chloe. Chloe,
it's the middle of the night.

1522
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,000
Marcus, we...
we need to talk.

1523
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:36,200
Okay.

1524
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,600
Is everything okay?

1525
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,600
It is better
than I ever could have imagined.

1526
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:41,874
Chloe, you're breaking up.

1527
01:03:42,834 --> 01:03:44,200
- Are you there?
- Yeah, barely.

1528
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,853
What is it
that you need to talk about?

1529
01:03:47,633 --> 01:03:48,873
I don't think this is working...

1530
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,543
You're doing a lot of working?
That's great.

1531
01:03:51,567 --> 01:03:53,333
No, Marcus,
what I'm trying to say is...

1532
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:54,900
Chloe, look,
I can barely hear you,

1533
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:56,993
so why don't we just chat
when you get back, okay?

1534
01:03:58,033 --> 01:03:59,367
Bye.

1535
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:07,166
So, dinner starts at five,

1536
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,800
which means we only have
a few hours

1537
01:04:08,934 --> 01:04:10,133
to turn this town

1538
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:12,033
into the best party
that anyone's ever seen!

1539
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,033
Well, let's do this.

1540
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:15,567
We're gonna move
the round patio tables out

1541
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,242
and replace them
with the long dinner tables.

1542
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:18,066
Copy that.

1543
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,567
Ben, Chloe,

1544
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,266
you're going to add
those twinkly lights

1545
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,467
to the dance floor, right?

1546
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,467
Good!

1547
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
And, Adrian,

1548
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:26,743
I need you to bring your guitar.

1549
01:04:26,767 --> 01:04:27,633
You got it.

1550
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:28,767
Okay.

1551
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:30,333
Well, let's do it!
And have some fun!

1552
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:32,300
Let's go, team!

1553
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:33,467
All right.

1554
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,500
Team, go!

1555
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,800
Ta-dah!

1556
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:26,867
- Amazing,
- We did it.

1557
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,233
We actually pulled it off.

1558
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:30,367
I have a feeling

1559
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,710
it's going to be
the best dock party yet.

1560
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:33,242
And one that I need
to get cleaned up for.

1561
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:35,600
All right.
We'll see you tonight.

1562
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,467
Wow! Look at this!

1563
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:45,554
Oh, my goodness.
A little bit of everything.

1564
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,600
There you go.

1565
01:05:48,734 --> 01:05:50,567
- There you go.
- Thanks, Ben.

1566
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,800
And there, and there.

1567
01:05:51,934 --> 01:05:54,467
Oh, look at you
in a white sweater!

1568
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,166
Yes, it is white.

1569
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,543
I don't want you
to get anything on it.

1570
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:59,767
Oh! Wow.

1571
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,900
There you go.

1572
01:06:00,934 --> 01:06:01,700
Thank you, Mary.

1573
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,533
This is... special.

1574
01:06:05,934 --> 01:06:07,133
Hey, everything good?

1575
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,633
Chlo...

1576
01:06:18,133 --> 01:06:19,700
you look... amazing...

1577
01:06:19,834 --> 01:06:20,700
Thank you.

1578
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:22,934
And I am wearing a bib.

1579
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,367
Yes, you are.

1580
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:28,367
Ben, you turned my photos
into posters?

1581
01:06:29,967 --> 01:06:31,166
I did.

1582
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,166
- I hope that's okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1583
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,300
What I didn't expect

1584
01:06:33,433 --> 01:06:36,200
is for the tourists
to start making bids on them.

1585
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,142
Your photos just made
a bunch of money for the fund!

1586
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,934
I don't know what to say.

1587
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,066
Don't say you want one,

1588
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:42,867
because we're all sold out.

1589
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,200
- May I?
- Yes.

1590
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,300
Thank you.

1591
01:06:47,433 --> 01:06:50,033
This is so much fun, Chloe!
What a great idea!

1592
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,533
I've never been a fan
of fine dining,

1593
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:54,500
it's hard to make rubber boots
look classy.

1594
01:06:54,633 --> 01:06:56,867
Well, I think you look gorgeous,

1595
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,467
and this looks delicious.

1596
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,600
Good job, everybody.

1597
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,667
Cheers.

1598
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:01,734
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

1599
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:05,867
Cheers.

1600
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,876
And just when we thought
we'd seen it all from Ben,

1601
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,376
he goes to throw
the trap in the water...

1602
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,600
And forgets to let go!

1603
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,533
Boots on and everything...

1604
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,934
And you should have seen
his face when he came back up!

1605
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:25,710
You know, he did say
he loves his cold plunges!

1606
01:07:25,734 --> 01:07:26,734
Yeah, and, you know,

1607
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,976
he's just happy
that it wasn't a time

1608
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,900
when we all kept
our cell phones in our pockets!

1609
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:34,000
You know, I'm laughing so hard,
I'm crying.

1610
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,233
Excuse me.

1611
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:36,734
I still don't have a cell phone!

1612
01:07:36,867 --> 01:07:38,066
For the record.

1613
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,367
Well, you might not be
much of a fisherman,

1614
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,700
but you are one fine tour guide.

1615
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:43,934
Thank you.

1616
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,700
Shall we?

1617
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:54,433
Oh.

1618
01:07:58,066 --> 01:07:59,700

1626

No napkins?

1627
01:09:04,533 --> 01:09:07,633
But we need to serve dessert.

1628
01:09:07,767 --> 01:09:09,333
Um, we should help.

1629
01:09:09,467 --> 01:09:11,166
Yeah, sure.

1630
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,567
There's some napkins
in my office.

1631
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,800
Okay.

1632
01:09:15,934 --> 01:09:17,400
Great.

1633
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,600
Napkins.

1634
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,967
Everything okay?

1635
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,834
I don't want this
to end tomorrow.

1636
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:52,000
I need more time for my study,

1637
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,467
more time for...

1638
01:09:56,667 --> 01:10:00,300
I usually just keep to myself
around here.

1639
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,934
Same schedule, same routines,
same people.

1640
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,300
And you came here and you...

1641
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:11,734
you changed all of that.

1642
01:10:13,433 --> 01:10:14,967
Chloe, you changed everything.

1643
01:10:16,433 --> 01:10:17,567
I never realized

1644
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,333
how amazing it would be

1645
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:23,266
to share all this
with someone...

1646
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:25,467
until you.

1647
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:29,834
What I mean to say is
it's been fun.

1648
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:31,567
More than fun.

1649
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,700
It's been incredible.

1650
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:37,934
I don't want it to end either.

1651
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:39,567
But Cable Cove
isn't going anywhere.

1652
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,700
I'm not going anywhere.

1653
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:43,966
And anytime you want
to come back and visit...

1654
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:47,834
everything is going to be
exactly how you left it.

1655
01:10:47,967 --> 01:10:49,800
With at least one more Orca.

1656
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:52,643
That's all for tonight, folks!

1657
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:54,267
Make sure you have
a great night's sleep.

1658
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,693
So your eyes will be wide awake
for whale watching tomorrow!

1659
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,333
You know, I don't usually
take Adrian's advice,

1660
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:00,976
but I think he might
have a point on this one.

1661
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,033
Right, right.

1662
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,876
I would like to be up
before the birds tomorrow.

1663
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,066
I always thought you were
a bit of a night-owl.

1664
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,867
Wow, Ben.

1665
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:10,633
Nice one.

1666
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:31,166
Give me a sign.

1667
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:05,700
Pardon the interruption.

1668
01:12:05,834 --> 01:12:07,954
Do you know where I can find
the boat "Total Eclipse"?

1669
01:12:08,734 --> 01:12:10,867
Yeah. We keep her
down on slip 37,

1670
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,433
but we're keeping the big boats
off the water today.

1671
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:15,767
Not for what I paid for her.

1672
01:12:16,934 --> 01:12:17,934
See, my girlfriend,

1673
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:20,767
she studies...

1674
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,133
fish,

1675
01:12:22,266 --> 01:12:23,543
and I can't wait
to see Chloe's face

1676
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:25,207
when she sees
the super yacht I've rented.

1677
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,100
Uh, Chloe Turner?

1678
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:31,100
Yeah. Yeah, you know her?

1679
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:33,166
Yeah.

1680
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,700
Yeah, I've seen her around
all week.

1681
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,100
Small town.

1682
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:38,166
Right.

1683
01:12:40,266 --> 01:12:41,133
You know what,

1684
01:12:41,266 --> 01:12:42,443
she'll be looking
for the Echo pod today,

1685
01:12:42,467 --> 01:12:44,100
so your best bet

1686
01:12:44,233 --> 01:12:47,133
is to take the boat slowly
around The Broken Islands.

1687
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,033
Thanks, man.

1688
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,133
Oh, sorry about that.

1689
01:12:53,266 --> 01:12:54,300
Don't worry about it.

1690
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:01,767
Shouldn't have put it there
in the first place.

1691
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:20,333
Marcus?

1692
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:21,233
Hey!

1693
01:13:21,367 --> 01:13:22,367
Surprise!

1694
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:24,734
What are you doing here?

1695
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,734
I came to win you back
with a big romantic gesture!

1696
01:13:27,867 --> 01:13:30,900
Yeah, by flying
all the way here...

1697
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:32,367
to this place.

1698
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,834
- Where am I?
- Cable Cove.

1699
01:13:33,967 --> 01:13:34,967
Cable Cove, right!

1700
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,533
It's no Miami, but...

1701
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,100
maybe it's better
from the water?

1702
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,443
I've rented us
the biggest boat in the harbor...

1703
01:13:41,467 --> 01:13:42,467
Six engines!

1704
01:13:43,567 --> 01:13:45,333
You can't. I can't...

1705
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:46,333
What do you mean?

1706
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:48,166
Marcus, I can't do this anymore.

1707
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,580
I don't think you understand me.

1708
01:13:53,633 --> 01:13:56,200
Honestly, I don't think
we understand each other.

1709
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,266
There is something about us
that doesn't click,

1710
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,700
and I know
that you feel it, too.

1711
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,166
Yeah, I do.

1712
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,300
I get it.

1713
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,066
I just can't believe
we're breaking up

1714
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,567
after I flew all the way here
in coach.

1715
01:14:15,734 --> 01:14:17,033
You are so brave.

1716
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,367
You are such a special guy.

1717
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,640
I would really like it
if we could still be friends.

1718
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:25,100
Of course.

1719
01:14:25,233 --> 01:14:27,233
And, hey, I tried.

1720
01:14:28,233 --> 01:14:29,600
I know you did.

1721
01:14:29,734 --> 01:14:30,967
I'm so sorry.

1722
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,333
Don't be.

1723
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,380
You obviously love it here.

1724
01:14:35,467 --> 01:14:37,347
I can see it all over your face.
You're glowing.

1725
01:14:39,233 --> 01:14:40,353
I just want you to be happy.

1726
01:14:41,367 --> 01:14:42,567
Thank you.

1727
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:45,233
Okay, well,

1728
01:14:45,367 --> 01:14:46,233
I'd better hurry

1729
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:47,927
if I'm going to get
a plane out of here.

1730
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:50,734
I wonder if I can still
get a refund on that boat.

1731
01:14:54,467 --> 01:14:55,333
Bye, you.

1732
01:14:55,467 --> 01:14:57,000
Bye, Marcus.

1733
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:15,467
Oh.

1734
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,667
Mary, have you seen Ben?

1735
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,567
Yeah, sure,
he jetted off on his boat.

1736
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,834
That's strange,
we were supposed go together.

1737
01:15:22,967 --> 01:15:24,867
Well, Marcus told him

1738
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,300
that he was taking you
on a super yacht instead?

1739
01:15:27,433 --> 01:15:28,533
He what?

1740
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,633
Yeah, Ben even told
the other boats

1741
01:15:30,767 --> 01:15:32,000
to call out to "Total Eclipse"

1742
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:33,400
if anyone saw the Echo pod.

1743
01:15:33,533 --> 01:15:35,133
I was never
going to go with Marcus,

1744
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:36,976
I was waiting for Ben.
I have to get to his boat!

1745
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,033
Chloe!

1746
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,166
All the guide boats
are out whale watching already.

1747
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:42,800

already, are you?

Yeah. I booked
an earlier flight.

1767
01:17:11,567 --> 01:17:14,166
But what about
your scholarship application?

1768
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,100
I don't have a boat.

1769
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:18,367
Or Ben.

1770
01:17:21,066 --> 01:17:23,200
Mary, I just wanted
to say thank you.

1771
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:24,633
Now, how much do I owe you?

1772
01:17:26,033 --> 01:17:27,667
You don't owe me a cent,

1773
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,667
not after everything
that you've done for me.

1774
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:31,700
I only wish there was

1775
01:17:31,834 --> 01:17:33,367
more that I could do for you
right now.

1776
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,934
Are you sure you want to leave
without saying goodbye to Ben?

1777
01:17:36,066 --> 01:17:37,066
It's for the best.

1778
01:17:38,066 --> 01:17:39,743
Without the possibility
of a research scholarship,

1779
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:41,500
there is no way
I can stay in Cable Cove.

1780
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:43,409
Well, can I get you anything
before you leave?

1781
01:17:43,433 --> 01:17:45,066
Tea? Coffee?

1782
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,300
Wine?

1783
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:48,400
Tempting.

1784
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:49,853
My car's gonna be here
any minute.

1785
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:52,667
You will always have
a cabin here, Chloe.

1786
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,367
You have changed
this little town for the better

1787
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,333
and made your mark
on all of us...

1788
01:17:58,467 --> 01:17:59,467
Especially Ben.

1789
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,500
Mayday! Mayday!

1790
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:03,734
This is Marine Magic.

1791
01:18:03,867 --> 01:18:04,867
I repeat...

1792
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:06,133
Mayday! Mayday!

1793
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,426
This is Marine Magic reporting
complete engine failure.

1794
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:10,500
Flooded electrical.
May need to abandon ship.

1795
01:18:10,633 --> 01:18:13,300
This is shore
calling Marine Magic.

1796
01:18:13,433 --> 01:18:14,500
What is your location?

1797
01:18:14,633 --> 01:18:16,834
I'm approximately four miles...

1798
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,433
Marine Magic?
Come in, Marine Magic!

1799
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:23,100
Ben! Please, Ben!

1800
01:18:23,233 --> 01:18:24,633
This is Crab Bucket
to Marine Magic.

1801
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,967
We've just docked in harbor.

1802
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:26,967
Turning around immediately!

1803
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,100
Hold on, buddy!

1804
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:30,543
That's Adrian.
He's at the marina!

1805
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:32,166
Hurry! Go!

1806
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,266
Wait!

1807
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,600
Go! Go!

1808
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:17,000
Ben!

1809
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:24,267
Shawna, it's choppy,
and the water is so cold,

1810
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:25,200
how could anyone...

1811
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,734
He's okay, it's Ben.

1812
01:19:26,867 --> 01:19:28,333
He's always okay.

1813
01:19:29,967 --> 01:19:31,407
Crab Bucket
to Marine Magic. Come in.

1814
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,066
Crab Bucket to Marine Magic.

1815
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,476
If his radio isn't working,
does that mean it's underwater?

1816
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,042
I'm sure his electrical system
is just flooded,

1817
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:41,367
that's all,

1818
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,076
but he's definitely
not hearing us from here.

1819
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:43,967
Maybe he's at the inlet.

1820
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,500
How far is it?

1821
01:19:45,633 --> 01:19:47,433
- Four and a half nautical miles.
- All right.

1822
01:19:47,567 --> 01:19:49,127
Hold on, I'm putting her
into overdrive.

1823
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,100
There he is!

1824
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,300
He's okay!

1825
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:26,133
Hey!

1826
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:32,166
Over here!

1827
01:20:42,567 --> 01:20:43,900
Are you okay?

1828
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:46,233
I am.

1829
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:48,033
Guys, I'm so sorry.

1830
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:50,433
My engine flooded
and it took out my electrical.

1831
01:20:50,567 --> 01:20:52,500
I've just been floating around,

1832
01:20:52,633 --> 01:20:54,500
reconsidering
my whole no cell phone thing.

1833
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,734
- We'll get her ready for a tow.
- Thank you.

1834
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,900
Um...

1835
01:21:02,033 --> 01:21:03,033
Ben, I didn't know

1836
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:04,409
that Marcus was going
to show up like that.

1837
01:21:04,433 --> 01:21:05,710
Hey, Chloe,
you don't have to explain.

1838
01:21:05,734 --> 01:21:07,600
No, I do.

1839
01:21:07,734 --> 01:21:08,600
Marcus and I broke up.

1840
01:21:08,734 --> 01:21:09,900
What?

1841
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,266
He's going back to Miami.

1842
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:14,233
We were never a match,

1843
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:16,066
and I tried so hard
to ignore that,

1844
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,467
but when I met you...

1845
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,000
something just clicked.

1846
01:21:20,867 --> 01:21:22,633
I feel the same way.

1847
01:21:22,767 --> 01:21:24,600
With you, all the pieces,
they just...

1848
01:21:24,734 --> 01:21:25,854
I don't know, they just fit.

1849
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,734
Everything's new,
and fresh, and exciting,

1850
01:21:29,867 --> 01:21:31,133
and easy...

1851
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,266
Even when it's not.

1852
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:35,233
With you,

1853
01:21:35,367 --> 01:21:36,543
I finally get
what people are talking about

1854
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:37,433
when they say,

1855
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:39,367
"When the right one comes along,

1856
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,800
you'll know."

1857
01:21:41,867 --> 01:21:43,467
Well, Ben...

1858
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,100
there are three things I know.

1859
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,467
Mm-hmm?

1860
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,300
I know I belong in Cable Cove.

1861
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,533
I know you are
who I belong with.

1862
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,967
And I know I love you.

1863
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,233
I love you, too, Chloe.

1864
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,200
Oh!

1865
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:15,200
Hey, is that the Echo pod?

1866
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,333
I think so.

1867
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:19,467
Oh, my goodness! Wow!

1868
01:22:20,633 --> 01:22:22,633
Ben, is that...
Is that a baby whale?

1869
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:24,967
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, my goodness.

1870
01:22:27,066 --> 01:22:29,467
Hi, baby whale!
Welcome to the world.

1871
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:35,400
I believe our littlest pod
just got a lot cuter.

1872
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:36,533
Yeah, it did.

1873
01:22:38,967 --> 01:22:40,467
And they're in the Sound,

1874
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,467
which means...

1875
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,633
My research study was right.

1876
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,760
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

1877
01:22:46,834 --> 01:22:49,500
All right. Let's get you back
to Cable Cove.

1878
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:50,500
I think someone has

1879
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,467
a research application
to complete.

1880
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,467
Mm-mm.

1881
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,367
There's plenty of time
for that tonight.

1882
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,800
This is the kind of magic
you have to see to believe.

1883
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,600
Good morning, Professors.

1884
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,633
Good morning, Chloe Turner.

1885
01:23:21,767 --> 01:23:23,533
The board has reviewed
your application

1886
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:25,200
and we do have good news.

1887
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:27,967
It was easily one of

1888
01:23:28,066 --> 01:23:29,706
the best applications
we've ever received.

1889
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,533
You're kidding?

1890
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:35,500
We're also awarding you
three additional grants.

1891
01:23:35,633 --> 01:23:37,676
Combined, this should allow you
to stay at Cable Cove

1892
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,133
and start up
your whale live-stream.

1893
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,166
Thank you!

1894
01:23:41,233 --> 01:23:42,533
Thank you so much!

1895
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,767
We're going to miss you
here in Miami,

1896
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,460
but the world
will be better off for it.

1897
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:48,367
Congratulations, Chloe.

1898
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,867
Yes!

1899
01:23:56,467 --> 01:23:58,133
- So?
- I got the scholarship!

1900
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,633
Yes!

1901
01:24:02,533 --> 01:24:03,400
I knew it!

1902
01:24:03,533 --> 01:24:06,367
Which means
I get to stay in Cable Cove!

1903
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:09,467
Congratulations,
Dr. Chloe Turner.

1904
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:20,767
Welcome home.

1905
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,333
I am still not a doctor.

1905
